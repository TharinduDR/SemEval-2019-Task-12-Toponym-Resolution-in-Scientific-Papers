Abstract: It is important not only to collect epidemiologic data on
HIV but to also fully utilize such information to understand the epidemic over time and to help inform and monitor the impact of policies
and interventions. We describe and apply a novel method to estimate
the size and characteristics of HIV-positive populations. The method
was applied to data on men who have sex with men living in the UK
and to a pseudo dataset to assess performance for different data availability. The individual-based simulation model was calibrated using

an approximate Bayesian computation-based approach. In 2013,
48,310 (90% plausibility range: 39,900–45,560) men who have sex
with men were estimated to be living with HIV in the UK, of whom
10,400 (6,160–17,350) were undiagnosed. There were an estimated
3,210 (1,730–5,350) infections per year on average between 2010
and 2013. Sixty-two percent of the total HIV-positive population are
thought to have viral load <500 copies/ml. In the pseudo-epidemic
example, HIV estimates have narrower plausibility ranges and are
closer to the true number, the greater the data availability to calibrate
the model. We demonstrate that our method can be applied to settings
with less data, however plausibility ranges for estimates will be wider
to reflect greater uncertainty of the data used to fit the model.

espite the introduction of effective antiretroviral therapy
(ART), HIV remains a key public health issue in most
parts of the world, including Europe. UNAIDS estimates suggest that there were 2.2 million people living with HIV in the
European region in 2012.1
To understand an HIV epidemic in detail, a range of
epidemiological data is required. Such data will help inform
and monitor the impact of policies and interventions to
tackle issues of prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of HIV.
UNAIDS have launched a new target, “90-90-90,” which
refers to three key steps to improve healthcare outcomes for
HIV-positive people and to limit new infections: 90% of HIVpositive people to know their status, 90% of all diagnosed
people to receive ART, and 90% of all people receiving ART
to have viral suppression. There has also been increased interest in estimating the HIV care cascade2,3 as an additional tool
to understand and monitor linkage and retention in care.
It is desirable to have some estimates, regardless of
the availability of surveillance data, to be able to consider
future healthcare needs and to understand the importance of
improved surveillance systems. A number of methods already
exist to estimate the number of people living with HIV, which

are based on fitting to prevalence survey data or performing
back-calculations to reconstruct the historical HIV incidence
curve.4–6 However, there are relatively few countries in Europe
where these methods are currently applied, due to lack of available data or resources, or concerns over their applicability for
concentrated epidemics.7 Even in settings where such methods
have been applied, few have provided a breakdown of the characteristics of HIV-positive populations, including size of the
undiagnosed population, CD4 count and viral load distribution
of the total population and the undiagnosed population, and
number of people with triple class drug failure and resistance.
The objective of the Stochastic Simulation of Outcomes of People with HIV In Europe project in EuroCoord
(EuroCoord-SSOPHIE project) is to generate such HIV estimates
for European countries by developing a calibration method using
an individual-based model of HIV. We present here the method
we have developed which first calibrates such a model to the
range of surveillance data available, and then uses the parameter
sets which calibrate well to estimate and characterise the status of
HIV-positive populations. The method is applied to data on men
who have sex with men (MSM) in the UK and to pseudodata to
assess the impact of different levels of availability of data.

METHODS
In brief, the calibration method presented here is a set
of procedures that uses existing methodology (approximate
Bayesian computation [ABC] methods) to calibrate a simulation model of HIV, to make inference about the populations
simulated using parameter sets which calibrate well to the
available data (includes both routinely collected case-report
data and observational data). The method is first applied to
generate HIV estimates for MSM in the UK for 2013. Surveillance data used to calibrate the model were obtained from
Public Health England databases. Behavioural and other clinical data were obtained from a range of sources, described in
references.8,9 We chose the MSM epidemic in the UK as it has
been studied extensively using other methods and there are
other estimates with which we can compare our results.10,11
We assume that the first infections occurred in 1980. Diagnosis of HIV was possible from 1984 onwards.12 ART use was
based on information from clinical cohorts.13 This modelling
study was exempt from the need for review by the institutional
review board as only aggregate data published in the public
domain were used.

The Model
The method uses an updated version of an individualbased stochastic simulation model of HIV progression and
the effect of ART (HIV Synthesis progression model).9,14,15
The model is programmed in SAS software, Version 9.3 (SAS
Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Model assumptions and parameters
are based on data from observational cohort studies and clinical trials. The model aims to reconstruct the HIV-positive
population of interest by simulating data on individual people
248 | www.epidem.com

from infection and following them over time. Variables such as
CD4 count, viral load, use of specific antiretrovirals, treatment
interruptions, presence of resistance mutations, and adherence
levels are updated every 3 months. The risk of loss to followup, AIDS events, AIDS deaths, and non-AIDS deaths are
also modeled. Note that in this model, we do not follow HIVnegative individuals as transmission of HIV is not modeled.
Further details of the model have been described ­previously,8,9
and additional updates are included in the eAppendix
(­Section 2; http://links.lww.com/EDE/A994).
There are multiple parameter values describing various
elements of the underlying progression of HIV and the effect
of ART. We have previously shown that the model output
mimics empirical data on such processes well.8,14 Therefore,
for the purpose of calibrating the model parameters to a given
HIV-positive population, we hold parameter values reflecting
the intrinsic effects of HIV and ART fixed. In other words, this
assumes that these parameter values are the same regardless of
the population under consideration and are effectively part of
the model structure.

Parameter Values Sampled Per Simulation
To calibrate the model to a particular population, the
parameters which are sampled are those thought to potentially
differ between populations or which have a large degree of
uncertainty. We chose to focus only on one population (MSM)
because the HIV incidence and diagnosis rate curves will typically differ by transmission route.
The two main sets of parameters for which values are sampled per simulation are those which parameterize the HIV incidence (number of new infections per year) and diagnosis rate.
As all individuals in our progression model are HIV positive, the
latter is the probability of diagnosis in an undiagnosed, asymptomatic individual in any 3-month period. The incidence and
diagnosis rate curves between 1980 and 2013 are parameterized
using seven and four parameters, respectively. These parameters
inform two independent piecewise constant curves, i.e., the incidence and diagnosis rate are modeled to be constant over 5- and
8-year periods, respectively. We use such crude parameterization
to limit the number of parameters and because the aim is not to
estimate these curves per se, but to find sets of parameter values
which generate a modeled population with characteristics similar to that of the surveillance and/or observational data.
There are a number of other parameter values that are
likely to be specific for a given population and which are also
varied across simulations: proportion of people resistant to
testing, probability of not being linked to care soon after diagnosis, rate of loss to follow-up while ART-naïve, rate of treatment interruption, rate of restarting ART after interruption, rate
of loss to follow-up while interrupting ART, rate of re-entry
into care, probability of starting ART when eligible, rate of
emigration and the population distribution of adherence levels. The prior distributions of these parameters are derived
from observational studies carried out in the setting of interest

or from other European studies. We sampled these parameters
per simulation to reflect the uncertainty conveyed by the prior
distributions used.

How the Model Is Calibrated to Country Data
The model is calibrated using ABC methods.16 The model
naturally lends itself to working in a Bayesian framework to
account for multiple parameter combinations providing outputs
which fit well to the observed data (instead of converging to a
single set of parameter values as would be the case in maximum
likelihood estimation). ABC methods are suitable for calibrating
simulation models to multiple datasets within tolerance bounds
and have the advantage of accounting for parameter uncertainty
and correlations. They are ideal for our purpose because we wish
to explore a wide parameter space and consider as many parameter sets as possible that are consistent with the data.
ABC involves running the model multiple times where
each run of the model is considered one simulation. In each
simulation, unknown parameters are sampled from prior distributions, thereby constructing a different HIV-positive population. For each simulation, outputs of the model are compared
with a range of surveillance data (in settings with incomplete
surveillance systems, observational data may be used additionally or instead). Hereafter, we refer to each type of data (e.g.,
number of HIV diagnoses) as a “data item.” We quantify how
well the model outputs match the surveillance data (i.e., assessing the goodness-of-fit) by calculating the “calibration score.” If
the calibration score is within the tolerance threshold, then the
set of parameter values used for that simulation are accepted.
This process is repeated over multiple simulations. Further
details of this calibration procedure are included in the eAppendix (Section 3; http://links.lww.com/EDE/A994).

Method to Estimate HIV-positive Populations

For any single simulation, the calibration score is calculated as the weighted average of the deviances of the modeled outputs from the observed data. Therefore, the lower
the calibration score, the better the model fits to the data.
Weights for each data item are chosen a priori to reflect perceived data quality and completeness. Examples of data items
which may be used to calibrate the model include: number of
HIV diagnoses, number of first AIDS diagnoses, number of
deaths, median CD4 count at diagnosis, number of new diagnoses which are recent infections, number seen in care and
number on ART. The calibration process is continued until
at least 100 sets of parameter values are within the tolerance
threshold. In this particular application of the method, we
have specified that the threshold should be a calibration score
<0.2 (i.e., average deviation from the observed data across all
data items is <20%). Further simulations are then performed
using the accepted parameter sets to account for stochastic
variability (i.e., variability in model outputs between simulation runs when using the same parameter set). The median,
5th and 95th percentiles of the distribution of these model
outputs at each calendar year are considered the point estimate and plausibility range limits, respectively. The primary
model outputs of interest are the number of people living
with HIV, broken down by diagnosis status, ART-use, viral
load, and CD4 count strata.
To apply this method to the HIV epidemic among MSM
in the UK, the model is calibrated to a wide range of surveillance data available until 2012. As it is an individual-based
model, we simulate a random 10% sample of the total infections to make the simulations more manageable, then multiply our outputs up. The data items and corresponding weights
used to calibrate the model are shown in the Table.

We also apply the calibration method to pseudodata to
assess how well our method works for different availability
of data items. The pseudodata was simulated also using the
HIV Synthesis progression model, for a given incidence and
diagnosis rate (all other parameters are fixed). The simulated
outputs are used as if they are real data and the method is
applied to model the hypothetical epidemic. Various data for
the epidemic can then be assumed to be “unknown,” which
then allows us to use the method described above to see how
well it is able to reconstruct the true epidemic in different data
availability scenarios. We conceived three scenarios of data
availability: high, medium, and low (Table). The method was
applied under each scenario and the resulting HIV estimates
compared. Although this approach is somewhat circular in
that the same model is used to generate and analyse the epidemic, it provides a useful means of being able to compare our
calibration method with differing levels of data availability.
Full details are given in the eAppendix (Section 5; http://links.
lww.com/EDE/A994).

RESULTS
Calibration to Data on MSM in the UK and
Resulting Estimates for 2013
Twenty-thousand simulations of the epidemic were generated, of which 294 were within the 0.2 calibration score tolerance threshold. A further 1,000 simulations were performed
by resampling these 294 parameter sets. The following results
presented are those generated using the 742 parameter sets
where the calibration score was <0.2 (median: 0.178, min:
0.107, max: 0.199) among the 1,000 resampled simulations.
Figure 1 shows that the model largely calibrates to the surveillance data. The surveillance data in 2012 compared with the
median across the simulations, respectively, were number of
HIV diagnoses (3,230 vs. 2,840), number of AIDS diagnoses
(140 vs. 360), number of deaths (160 vs. 290), proportion of
diagnoses with CD4 <350 cells/mm3 (34% vs. 39%), number
seen for care (33,970 vs. 35,310) and number seen for care
and currently on ART (28,530 vs. 30,215).
The distribution of incidence and diagnosis rate parameters are shown in Figure 2. This shows a steady increase in
incidence from 1980, followed by a slightly lower level in
the early 1990s and then a gradual increase again from then
onwards. An estimated 3,210 (90% plausibility range:1,730–
5,350) infections per year on average are thought to have
occurred since 2010. The cumulative number of HIV infections that is thought to have occurred by end of 2012 totalled
67,720 (56,470–78,800). The diagnosis rate in asymptomatic
individuals has steadily increased over time, but still remains
low at an estimated rate of 0.042 (0.025–0.069) per 3 months
in recent years.
By 2013, an estimated 48,310 (90% plausibility range:
39,900–45,560) MSM were living with HIV in the UK
(­Figure 3), and 2,300, 5,500, 11,830, and 28,680 individuals
250 | www.epidem.com

had CD4 count ≤200, 201–350, 351–500, and >500 cells/
mm3 respectively. It is thought that 10,400 (6,160–17,350)
MSM were living with undiagnosed HIV, which means the
undiagnosed proportion is 22% (13%–36%, Figure 3). In this
undiagnosed population, an estimated 710, 1,930, 3,040, and
4,720 individuals had CD4 count ≤200, 201–350, 351–500,
and >500 cells/mm3, respectively.
Figure 4A shows the estimated HIV care cascade in
2013. According to the model outputs, of all MSM living with
HIV in 2013, 22% were undiagnosed, 23% were not in care,
and 66% were receiving ART (current UK guidelines recommend ART to be initiated once the CD4 count drops below
350 cells/mm3). More than half (62%) of all HIV-positive MSM
are thought to have suppressed viral load (<500 copies/ml). Of
the 40,530 MSM in need of treatment (defined as people on
ART and people ART-naïve with CD4 count <500 cells/mm3),
80% were estimated to be actually receiving it. Figure 4B
shows a detailed breakdown of the population characteristics
in terms of diagnosis status, treatment status, viral load distribution, CD4 count distribution, and resistance development.

Validation on Pseudodata to Assess Impact of
Various Degrees of Data Availability
The results that follow are based on 100 simulations
which had calibration score <0.2 for each of the three data
availability scenarios. Where there were more than 100 simulations with calibration score <0.2, the 100 parameter sets
leading to the 100 smallest calibration scores were used. The
smallest calibration score achieved among these 100 simulations were 0.153, 0.138, and 0.001, respectively, for “high,”
“medium,” and “low” data availability.
Figure 5 shows the estimated number of people living with HIV and living with undiagnosed HIV in 2013 by
data availability. The category, “based on prior distributions,”
refers to the median and 90% plausibility range of the estimates based on the full parameter distributions, including the
outputs which did not get accepted based on the tolerance
threshold; the plausibility range for this category therefore
shows how wide it could have been if there were no data to
calibrate the model to, compared with the other three scenarios). Although the smallest minimum calibration score was
achieved with the “low” data availability scenario, the plausibility range is also the widest as the model was calibrated only
to two data points.
Figure 6 depicts how well each data availability scenario
was able to recapture the “true” incidence and diagnosis rate
curves. Comparing with the incidence curve firstly, only the
“high” scenario was able to obtain the approximate trend of
an initial rise in incidence, followed by a dip, then a gradual
increase subsequently, although some of the observations are
outside the 90% plausibility range. All three scenarios estimate approximately the same number of infections which took
place from 2010 onward, although the widths of the plausibility range differ greatly. Comparing with the diagnosis rate

the effects of ART. As the model reconstructs the population
characteristics at a level corresponding to data collected as
part of clinical care, it provides an approach to describe and
understand HIV-positive populations in detail. We have shown
that it is possible to generate estimates of numbers of people
living with HIV and their characteristics, albeit with different
levels of uncertainty, depending on the quality and availability
of surveillance data. Together with other available information, epidemiologic and clinical estimates generated using our
method could be used to further inform decisions and policies.17,18 Although the HIV care cascade can be ascertained
using alternative estimates of the undiagnosed proportion
together with available surveilance data about the diagnosed
population, we have also demonstrated (Figure 4) that it is
possible to estimate the full cascade using this approach.
The number of MSM living with HIV in the UK is now
estimated to be 48,310 for 2013. We estimated that there were
approximately 3,210 new infections per year between 2010

and 2013, which was higher than the average for 2005–2009.
However, the total number of undiagnosed HIV infections is
thought to have remained reasonably stable over the past 5 to
7 years at around 10,000. The estimates and plausibility ranges
generated using our method are based on the assumptions
within the HIV Synthesis progression model and the prior distributions chosen. Our results were consistent with other UK
estimates of the number of MSM living with HIV, living with
undiagnosed HIV, and their CD4 count distribution.10
Results from our pseudodata example, which compared
estimates when calibrating the model with varying amounts of
data availability, show the difference in estimates and ranges
for three different scenarios. Our results indicate that more
reliable estimates are made with a wide range of surveillance
data, and that having historical data also helps. The width of
the plausibility range increases with less data available to
calibrate the model. The differences between the three different scenarios showed that having data about the current

population in care, such as data on the numbers of people on
ART and case-report data on the number of diagnoses in a
year, vastly help inform estimates of the total numbers living
with HIV.
Our method has a number of advantages. The HIV
Synthesis progression model simulates each individual’s life
course and therefore reconstructs detailed characteristics of
individuals which compose the HIV-positive population.19
The model can therefore be calibrated to a wide range of
observational data (data items) simultaneously, which is beneficial because for some countries there may not be much HIV
case-report data while data on the numbers of people on ART
might be very accurate. It is possible to calibrate the model to

less data; however, the plausibility ranges will be wider due to
greater uncertainty. It is thus a very flexible approach which
can utilise the data that is available, including but not limited
to case-report data. We consider that our method is particularly
useful when there are various sources of data available, as it
also provides a framework for triangulation to assess overall
coherence and consistency of data from various sources. The
method in principle becomes very similar to other existing
back-calculation methods when it uses only data that are used
in those methods for calibration.
Using an individual-based model means that it is possible to estimate not only the size of the undiagnosed population but also we can simultaneously describe the population in

terms of whether they are in care, ART coverage, immunological status, and population viral load. The model is also able to
take account of specific drug use if data on regimens used are
available, and hence can output estimates of drug resistance
mutations and drug side effects, which may further help to
inform national recommendations and policies.
By extending the duration of the simulated epidemic
and projecting into the future, the method can also potentially
254 | www.epidem.com

be used for making short-term projections. Such projections,
however, will be based heavily on the assumptions made
regarding the incidence and diagnosis rate in the future and all
resulting estimates will only be as reliable as the information
put into the model.
A limitation of any modelling approach is that the validity of model estimates is highly dependent on the quality of
available data used to calibrate the model. This means that

the more reliable and accurate the data used to calibrate the
model, the more likely estimates will be useful. In particular,
it is essential to know the characteristics of the data and the
mechanisms of surveillance systems so that these can inform
the model calibration process. For instance, most countries
will know about data problems such as under-ascertainment,
double-counting, and misclassification bias, so efforts to
reduce these errors or otherwise adjust the surveillance data
accordingly is of importance. In our UK MSM example specifically, we think that the discrepancy between the observed
data and modeled outputs on AIDS case reports (Figure 1) is
due to known substantial under-reporting of such data in the
UK in the era of effective ART.20 For this reason, the model
was not calibrated to data on AIDS case reports in those years
(Table).
There are also a number of other limitations specific to
our approach. First, even though our simulations are run on
a computing cluster, as we use an individual-based model,
our method is time consuming. However, once the plausible
range of the historic incidence and diagnosis rate curves
have been estimated, updating the estimates in future years
will not require the same intensive fitting process to find
parameter sets which calibrate well. Another limitation is the
choice to use piecewise constant curves to parameterize the
incidence and diagnosis rate. Other back-calculation studies
on MSM epidemics in Western Europe have found a peak in
incidence in the early to mid-1980s21–23; however, due to the
parameterization used, we cannot observe such a peak using
this method. Although this means that the resulting incidence curve may not be an accurate reflection of infections
in the past, estimates are unlikely to be severely biased, as
the modeled incidence is just an average over a given time
period. We investigate and discuss this further in the eAppendix (Section 4; http://links.lww.com/EDE/A994). One other
limitation is that the definition of a “good” calibration score
is somewhat arbitrary. The method simultaneously tries to fit
to multiple data items, which may have their own biases, over
a large number of years. Although we expect the data items
to be complementary with one another, they will nevertheless
have under- or over-counting nuances so we would not expect
the calibration score to be zero. The results from applying the
method to pseudodata illustrated that the more data there are
to calibrate the model, the less likely it is to find a small calibration score.24
The EuroCoord-SSOPHIE project aims to build on a
previous effort to generate HIV estimates for Europe.25 The
development of methods to produce various HIV estimates
and projections remains an important area within HIV epidemiology.10,22,26–28 Our method provides an alternative and
complementary approach to existing methods because a more
extensive range of data sources can be incorporated, if available. Having different methods that use different data and
assumptions enables us to see whether the various approaches
give comparable estimates, which provide support for the

various estimates. The method presented here also provides
a way to estimate key indicators such as the total number
of people living with HIV, which helps to put targets such
as the UNAIDS “90-90-90” into context. An adaptation of
the method will be required to model epidemics among risk
groups with a high proportion of migrants, such as people
who acquired HIV in sub-Saharan Africa, as it is assumed that
infections are mainly acquired in the setting of interest.
We have shown here an approach using an individualbased simulation model of HIV, which describes the size
and characteristics of HIV-positive populations. This novel
method allows us to also naturally produce plausibility ranges
for these estimates, which describe the uncertainty surrounding the estimates, based on the data to which the model was
calibrated.
