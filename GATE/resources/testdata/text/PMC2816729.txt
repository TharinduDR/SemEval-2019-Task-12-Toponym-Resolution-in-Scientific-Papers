The transmissibility of the strain of inﬂuenza virus which caused the 1968 inﬂuenza pandemic is poorly understood. Increases in outbreak size between the ﬁrst and second waves suggest that it may even have increased
between successive waves. The authors estimated basic and effective reproduction numbers for both waves of the
1968 inﬂuenza pandemic. Epidemic curves and overall attack rates for the 1968 pandemic, based on clinical and
serologic data, were retrieved from published literature. The basic and effective reproduction numbers were
estimated from 46 and 17 data sets for the ﬁrst and second waves, respectively, based on the growth rate and/
or ﬁnal size of the epidemic. Estimates of the basic reproduction number (R0) were in the range of 1.06–2.06 for the
ﬁrst wave and, assuming cross-protection, 1.21–3.58 in the second. Within each wave, there was little geographic
variation in transmissibility. In the 10 settings for which data were available for both waves, R0 was estimated to be
higher during the second wave than during the ﬁrst. This might partly explain the larger outbreaks in the second
wave as compared with the ﬁrst. This potential for change in viral behavior may have consequences for future
pandemic mitigation strategies.

The current pandemic of novel H1N1 influenza illustrates
the ability of novel influenza viruses to spread rapidly
through populations. H1N1 first emerged in spring 2009,
and a second wave is expected in the Northern Hemisphere
in the autumn. The 1968 (Hong Kong) H3N2 influenza pandemic also occurred in 2 waves, the second being more
severe than the first in many settings (1–9). Like H1N1
(and H5N1, another influenza virus with pandemic potential), the H3N2 virus was not completely antigenically novel
but shared its neuraminidase with the H2N2 virus, which
had circulated for the preceding 10 years.
The impact of any pandemic depends to a great extent on
the transmissibility of the causal pathogen, which is usually described using the basic reproduction number, R0 (the
average number of secondary infectious cases resulting
from an infectious person’s introduction into a totally susceptible population). The equivalent statistic in a partially
susceptible population is the effective (net) reproduction
number, Rn. According to several studies, the R0 of the

1918 H1N1 (10–16) and 1957 H2N2 (12, 13, 17) pandemic
influenza viruses was between 1.2 and 3. The characteristics of the H3N2 pandemic influenza virus are poorly understood. Estimates of its reproduction numbers have
primarily been based upon data from the second wave
(11–13, 18); in a study based on national general practice
consultation data from England and Wales, Hall et al. (19)
estimated that Rn increased slightly between successive
waves, from 1.28 to 1.56. Several estimates have been
based upon mortality data (11, 13, 18), and all but 2
(20, 21) were based on national (11, 13, 18, 19) or citylevel (12, 18) data from England and Wales. Few studies
have explored temporal or geographic variation in the R0 of
the 1968 pandemic virus.
In this study, we reviewed morbidity and serologic data
from diverse settings for the first and second waves of the
1968 influenza pandemic to determine the extent to which
R0 and Rn differed temporally, geographically, and between
successive waves.

b
For data sets with good ascertainment only. For serologic data, the proportion of the population meeting the case deﬁnition is not necessarily equivalent to the proportion experiencing infection during the given wave
(as seropositivity may reﬂect infection either during that wave or previously). ‘‘N/A’’ means that ascertainment was incomplete. Numerators may include persons who did not report the date of onset of illness and
therefore were not included in estimation of R0 using the epidemic growth rate.

Proportion susceptible based on the original data set or on data cited in the original paper.

Data cited in the paper implied that 94% of persons in the wider population were likely to be susceptible; however, because of the small size of this sample, it was necessary to round to 93%.
f
Case deﬁnition not given, but comparison with reference 25 suggests this deﬁnition.

Although these data refer to the second wave, the data were inconsistent with 50% of individuals being susceptible at the start of the wave. Therefore, it was assumed that all persons were initially susceptible.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data sources

We searched PubMed and CAB Direct from 1966 to 2006
for English-language studies that presented data on 1) the
proportions of persons who experienced infection (as implied by serologic analysis) or clinical disease and 2) weekly
numbers of cases during the first and/or second waves of the
1968 influenza pandemic. Reference lists in the articles retrieved were also searched, and key journals (including Bulletin of the World Health Organization, British Medical
Journal, and Weekly Epidemiological Record) from 1968–
1970 were hand-searched. Age-stratified data were also obtained where possible. The data sets (Tables 1 and 2) were
classified as referring to either confined (e.g., military bases,
ships, homes, schools) or open (cities or national populations) settings. Data sets which clearly included vaccinated
persons were excluded. The first and second waves were
defined from the identified reports, based on the timing of
the global circulation of the virus: approximately July 1968
to August 1969 for the first wave and September 1969 to
September 1970 for the second.
Serologic data. We identified 25 suitable serologic data sets
(17 for the first wave, 8 for the second (2–5, 22–31)). The definition of infection varied (Tables 1 and 2) but was frequently
either a hemagglutination-inhibiting antibody titer of 1:10 or
a 4-fold increase in hemagglutination-inhibiting antibody
titer. For consistency, when hemagglutination-inhibiting antibody titers were presented without a definition of infection,
a titer of 1:10 was taken as positive.
Clinical attack rates. We identified 11 data sets (9 for the
first wave, 2 for the second (1, 6, 22, 23, 32–35)) with suitable data on the proportion of persons who experienced
clinical disease (i.e., clinical attack rates). These were data
sets in which ascertainment appeared to be good—for example, from retrospective surveys or intervention studies. Case
definitions were taken from the original data sets. We calculated 95% exact binomial confidence intervals for both the
clinical attack rates and the proportions seropositive.
Epidemic curves. We identified 27 suitable data sets
(20 for the first wave, 7 for the second (1, 2, 6–9, 22, 23,
35–40)) on the weekly number of clinical cases (see Web
Figure 1, which is posted on the Journal’s Web site (http://
aje.oxfordjournals.org/)). Data sets involving small numbers
of cases (e.g., <25) or irregular increases in case numbers
were excluded.
Analyses of attack rates and reproduction numbers
Calculation of susceptible attack rates. For settings in
which the proportion of persons seropositive before and
after one or both waves was available, the susceptible attack
rate (ARsus) was calculated as

ARsus ¼

Ppost  Ppre
;
1  Ppre

where Ppre and Ppost are the proportions seropositive before
and after the given wave, respectively. We estimated 95%
Am J Epidemiol 2010;171:465–478

471

credible intervals for the susceptible attack rate by Monte
Carlo sampling of posterior distributions of the proportion
seropositive in each wave, using conjugate properties of the
beta distribution with binomial priors (41). Here, Ppre and
Ppost were treated as though they were independent.
Estimation of R0. R0 was estimated for each data set
using either the final size of the epidemic (for serologic data
and clinical data with good ascertainment) or its growth rate
(for epidemic curves) (42, 43) (Tables 1 and 2). These
methods do not account for contact patterns in the population. Although recent studies have suggested that contact
patterns are age-dependent (44), the attack rates in the
age-stratified data we retrieved did not vary with age
(Web Figures 2 and 3 (http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/)). This
is paradoxical and may reflect age-related differences in
susceptibility or case ascertainment. Such effects are difficult to study using the limited age-stratified data available;
therefore, we restricted our analyses to data which were not
age-stratified.
Estimates of R0 using the ﬁnal size of the epidemic. R0
was estimated for the corresponding data sets (1–6, 22–35)
using the equation (42)
R0 ¼

C i¼S i

where N is the population size, C is the number of infected
persons or clinical cases (depending on the data set) recorded during the wave, and S0 and Sf are the numbers of
persons considered to be susceptible in the population at the
beginning and end of the wave, respectively.
The standard error (SE) of R0 was calculated as (42)

Rn was estimated as Rn ¼ R0s, where s is the proportion of
the population that is susceptible to infection at the beginning of the wave. We calculated 95% confidence intervals
for Rn by multiplying the respective limits on R0 by the
proportion susceptible.
Estimates of R0 using the growth rate of the
epidemic. For each epidemic curve (1, 2, 6–9, 22, 23,

35–40; Web Figure 1), Rn was estimated using the equation
(43)


ð3Þ
Rn ¼ K2 LD þ K L þ D þ 1;
where L and D are the durations of the latent and infectious
periods, respectively, and K is the growth rate in the cumulative number of cases reported during the exponential
growth phase of the epidemic (calculated as the gradient
of the straight line fitted to the natural logarithm of the
cumulative number of cases during this phase). We estimated the length of this phase for each data set (Tables 1
and 2) by visually inspecting the plot of the natural logarithm of the cumulative number of cases against time. The
latent and infectious periods were each assumed to last 2 days,

consistent with experimental data (see references in the article
by Vynnycky et al. (15)). R0 was estimated using the equation R0 ¼ Rn/s. We calculated 95% confidence intervals for
Rn (and hence R0) from the 95% confidence limits on K.
Equation 3 assumes that the latent and infectious periods
follow the exponential distribution; however, in previous
analyses of several H1N1 pandemic influenza data sets, investigators found that R0’s in most cases were very similar,
irrespective of whether an exponential or tight distribution
of the latent and infectious periods was assumed (15). We
also used the expression eKT g (where Tg is the generation
time), which provides an upper bound for Rn (45), to assess
whether we had underestimated Rn.
All persons in a given setting were assumed to be susceptible to infection before the first pandemic wave, unless there
was evidence to the contrary (e.g., data on pre-epidemic
seropositivity) from the same setting or a similar setting
(Tables 1 and 2). The proportion susceptible at the start
of the second wave was also based on serologic data (see
Tables 1 and 2). For Guatemala and Khartoum, Sudan, serologic data were unavailable, and 50% of persons were
assumed to be susceptible at the start of the second wave,
which is plausible given the proportion of persons who were
seropositive after the first wave elsewhere (Web Figure 4
(http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/)).
To explore the sensitivity of our estimates of R0 and Rn to
assumptions about the proportion initially susceptible, all
analyses were repeated assuming that 100% and 50% of
each population was susceptible at the start of the first and
second waves, respectively.
RESULTS
Proportions infected and clinical attack rates

The proportion of persons with serologic evidence of infection after the first wave of the 1968 pandemic varied from
15% in a North Carolina children’s home to 76% in Japanese
Self-Defense Forces camps (Web Figure 4). After the second
wave, this proportion ranged from 37% in Mombasa, Kenya,
to 74% in São Paulo, Brazil. The corresponding susceptible
attack rates varied from 19% to 58% during the first wave and
from 15% to 50% during the second. Neither the clinical
attack rates nor the susceptible attack rate varied markedly
with age in the settings for which age-stratified data were
available (Web Figures 2 and 3).
Clinical attack rates were generally low (typically 10%–
20%) in open settings, except for Kansas City, Missouri, and
the Panama Canal Zone, where the attack rates were 39%
and 46%, respectively (Web Figure 4). Clinical attack rates
were available for only 2 confined settings; these were
higher (31% and 36%) than the clinical attack rates in most
open settings. Clinical attack rates varied little with age,
except in Doncaster, United Kingdom, where they were
highest in young to middle-aged adults (Web Figure 3).
Basic and effective reproduction numbers

R0 and Rn could be estimated from both the final size and
the growth rate of the respective epidemics in Kansas City

only second-wave data are shown. The 2 data sets for Epping, New South Wales, Australia, refer to 2 different retrospective surveys. Data from 5
other districts in Czechoslovakia (Tachov, Most, Pilsen, Ústı́ nad Labem, and Sokolov), described in the article by Fedová et al. (39), produced
results similar to the Czech data shown here (range, 1.10–1.19). ILI, inﬂuenza-like illness; PHLS, Public Health Laboratory Service; RCGP, Royal

during the first wave and in Khartoum and Doncaster during
the second (Tables 1 and 2). In all cases, the 2 methods
produced similar estimates. The rest of the estimates of R0
and Rn are considered irrespective of the method used.
For the first wave, Rn was estimated as 1.06–2.01 and
1.08–1.62 in open and confined settings, respectively
(Web Figure 5 (http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/)). The corresponding R0 estimates, allowing for pre-epidemic immunity
as indicated by seropositivity, were 1.06–2.06 and 1.08–1.62
(Figures 1 and 2). The estimates generally appeared similar
irrespective of the time of year or location. There were no
consistent differences between the estimates of R0 in open
and confined settings.
For the second wave, Rn was estimated as 1.08–2.02 in
open settings and as 1.43 (95% confidence interval: 1.23,
1.63) in a single confined setting. The corresponding R0
estimates for the second wave were 1.21–3.58 (open settings) and 1.86 (95% confidence interval: 1.60, 2.12) (confined setting). In all 10 settings for which R0 was estimated
for both waves, the point estimate for the second wave was
higher than that for the first (Table 3). Differences in Rn
between waves were variable (e.g., the point estimate for
the second wave was higher than that for the first in 7 of 10

data sets), since Rn also depends on the proportion of persons who were susceptible at the beginning of the wave.
Our estimates of Rn based on the growth rate were
generally only slightly smaller than the upper bound obtained using the expression eKT g (see Web Table (http://
aje.oxfordjournals.org/)).
Repetition of the analyses using the alternative assumptions that 100% and 50% of each population were susceptible at the beginning of the first and second waves,
respectively, produced R0 estimates of 1.06–2.01 during
the first wave and 1.21–4.22 during the second. The corresponding Rn estimates were 1.06–2.01 and 1.05–2.11 (data
not shown). Again, each second-wave R0 estimate was
higher than the corresponding first-wave estimate, while
changes in Rn between waves were less consistent.
DISCUSSION

Our results extend knowledge of the H3N2 influenza
pandemic, firstly by including data from a much wider geographic range of settings than has been previously analyzed
and secondly by estimating transmissibility during both
pandemic waves for multiple settings. We found that R0

increased between the 2 waves of the pandemic, being in the
ranges 1.06–2.06 and 1.21–3.58 during the first and second
waves, respectively. We found little geographic or temporal
variation in R0 or Rn within each wave. In contrast with
those found for the 1918 pandemic, our estimates for open
and confined settings differed little, perhaps because we defined ‘‘confined’’ rather broadly; for example, primary
schools and care homes in 1968/1969 would have been less
crowded than the prisons and ships considered for the 1918
pandemic (15).
One of our assumptions was that infection during the first
wave conferred immunity during the second. This was based
on the facts that 1) the proportion of persons who were
seropositive to the prototype Hong Kong virus isolated during the first wave increased between the 2 waves (2–5, 46);
2) hemagglutinin did not evolve significantly between the 2
waves (47, 48); and 3) in 1 study, no person with a 4-fold
rise in hemagglutination-inhibiting antibody titer during the
first wave showed evidence of infection during the second
(3).
Our conclusions also depended in part upon the quality of
the data assembled. Data quality was difficult to assess for
some of the data sets. Many of them appeared to be of high
quality, but a few had limitations, such as small sample
sizes, unclear clinical case definitions, or low antibody titers
in serologic case definitions (Tables 1 and 2). We restricted
our estimates of R0 based on the final epidemic size to data
sets with good ascertainment, since these estimates depend
on the completeness of case reporting (estimates based on
Am J Epidemiol 2010;171:465–478

the growth rate are sensitive to the completeness of reporting only if this changes over time). Clinical data, however,
are subject to misclassification and also will exclude asymptomatic infections. This could have caused us to underestimate R0 based on the final epidemic size from clinical data,
if asymptomatically infected persons were infectious.
For a few of the studies, data on the epidemic curve
during the early stages of the wave were absent (Web Figure
1). These missing notifications were attributed to background influenza infections or influenza-like illness. The
extent to which this assumption was appropriate was difficult to determine for Guatemala, since the outbreak of
influenza-like illness was preceded by an epidemic of
Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis (40). Missing data
late in the epidemic would not affect estimates based on
the growth rate, which use only data from the early stages.
Serologic data, while more specific than clinical data, also
have caveats. Firstly, for 6 of the serologic data sets, infection was defined using a relatively low hemagglutinationinhibiting antibody titer (1:10 or lower). Secondly, preepidemic seropositivity may indicate preexisting crossreacting antibody rather than infection with H3N2 influenza
(3, 24). Either of these factors could have caused us to overestimate the proportion of persons who were immune at
either the start or the end of the epidemic wave; the net
effect on our estimates of R0 is difficult to predict.
For example, overestimating the proportion immune at
the end of the wave would have caused us to overestimate
the final epidemic size and R0. Overestimating the

proportion immune at the start could have led to underestimation of the epidemic size and R0. It could also have
caused us to underestimate the proportion of persons in
the population who were responsible for generating the
cases during the epidemic, leading to an overestimate in R0.
We excluded data sets involving vaccinated persons
wherever possible. However, the limited quantities of vaccine available during the first wave are not believed to have
significantly affected the outbreaks in the United Kingdom
or the United States (2, 49). No other large-scale interventions or behavior changes were mentioned in the source
papers (where data referred to intervention trials, we included only the control groups), but people may have reactively reduced their social mixing, as apparently happened
during the 1918 pandemic (50). Successful interventions, if
implemented, would have reduced the epidemic size, leading us to underestimate R0 on this basis. However, they
probably would have been introduced too late to affect our
estimates based on the growth rate, which used only data
from the epidemic’s early stages.
To our knowledge, only 1 previous study has assessed the
transmissibility of H3N2 influenza during both pandemic
waves (19). Using general practice consultation data from
England and Wales, Hall et al. (19) found that Rn increased
slightly from 1.28 during the first wave to 1.56 during the
second. This is broadly consistent with our estimates of Rn
for this setting (nationally and subnationally), which ranged
from 1.10 to 1.30 during the first wave and from 1.19 to 2.02
during the second. While we estimated that R0 increased
between waves in all settings for which data on both waves

were available, it is unclear whether this conclusion is generalizable to other settings: It is possible that in some settings, only 1 wave occurred or a second wave occurred but
was not reported.
Changes in transmissibility have been examined for successive waves of the 1918 H1N1 pandemic. In Geneva,
Switzerland, R0 was estimated to increase from 1.49 during
the first wave to an Rn of 3.75 during the second wave (14).
In Scandinavia, transmissibility decreased between waves
(e.g., from 2.2–3.0 for R0 during the first wave to 1.2–1.3
for Rn during the second in Copenhagen, Denmark (16)),
which could be attributable to reductions in both the susceptible population and R0. Other studies of this pandemic found
that R0 decreased (e.g., from 2.1 to 1.8 to 1.5 in successive
waves in England and Wales (13)), showed no clear pattern
(12, 13), or remained relatively unchanged (15).
The increases in R0 between successive waves of the
H3N2 pandemic suggested here might be attributable to at
least 2 factors. First, they could be related to molecular
changes in the virus; for example, drift in the neuraminidase
between the 2 waves has been reported (47, 48) and could
perhaps be associated with increased transmissibility. Second, they could be related to the timing of the respective outbreaks. For example, the first wave in the United
Kingdom began just before Christmas, whereas the larger
outbreaks of the second wave in the United Kingdom and
the first wave in the United States began earlier in the year,
before holidays would have interrupted contact between
people at schools and workplaces. Immunity generated during the unusually large first wave in the United States probably helped to limit the attack rates there during the second
wave. It is interesting that, in Europe and Asia, the majority
of influenza-related deaths occurred during the second
wave, while in North America the first wave had the greater
mortality impact (48). We could not assess whether these
differences were reflected in changes in R0 between the 2
waves, since no suitable second-wave data were identified
for any American setting.
It is unlikely that the apparent increase in R0 between
waves was due to increased ascertainment during the second
wave (e.g., due to greater awareness of the virus), since
increases were observed even using serologic data from
samples submitted for other tests (2–4), for which ascertainment is unlikely to vary between waves.
Our estimates of R0 are lower than many previous estimates for the 1918 (10–16) and 1957 (12, 13, 17) pandemics, which is consistent with the correspondingly
smaller size of the 1968 pandemic. Our estimates of R0
for the first wave of the H3N2 pandemic are also lower than
the 2 previous estimates for this wave (20, 21), which were
derived from models describing the global spread of influenza; Rvachev and Longini (20) and Longini et al. (51)
estimated R0 as 3.10, and Cooper et al. (21) estimated it
as between 0.5–1.5 and 2.5–3.5. Both sets of investigators
assumed that approximately 60% of the global population
was initially susceptible. We generally assumed that the
proportion susceptible was higher than this, based on the
available serologic data for each setting. Using the figure
of 60% for the data sets for which this was possible would
produce estimates of R0 for the first wave of 1.76–3.35,
Am J Epidemiol 2010;171:465–478

Transmissibility of Hong Kong Inﬂuenza

consistent with these previous estimates. Our estimates of
Rn were close to the upper bounds (45); consequently, if our
assumptions about the proportion susceptible are correct,
our estimates of R0 are probably not underestimates. In fact,
if the generation time of H3N2 pandemic influenza was
shorter than the 4 days we assumed (shorter generation
times have been assumed for other influenza viruses (52)
and estimated for H1N1 influenza (53)), the R0 would be
even lower than estimated here.
R0 for the second pandemic wave has been estimated as 2.2
(12) and Rn as 1.85 (12), 1.8 (13), or 1.56 (19). Other analyses
of the second wave implied an R0 of 3.5 in England and Wales
and an R0 of 3.5 or 4.9 in Greater London (11, 18; Ben
Cooper, Health Protection Agency, United Kingdom, unpublished observations). Most of our R0 estimates for the second
wave lie within the range of these previous estimates.
It is possible that H1N1 influenza will cause a second
wave of infection, and it is difficult to predict whether the
virus will continue to behave as it has done thus far. Our
results indicate that pandemic influenza viruses may become more transmissible between successive waves, and
this possibility should be considered in mitigation strategies.
