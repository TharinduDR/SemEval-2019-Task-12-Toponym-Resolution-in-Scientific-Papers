The hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of H7 avian influenza virus (AIV) isolated between
1994 and 2002 from live-bird markets (LBMs) in the northeastern United States and from three outbreaks in
commercial poultry have been characterized. Phylogenetic analysis of the HA and NA genes demonstrates that
the isolates from commercial poultry were closely related to the viruses circulating in the LBMs. Also, since
1994, two distinguishing genetic features have appeared in this AIV lineage: a deletion of 17 amino acids in the
NA protein stalk region and a deletion of 8 amino acids in the HA1 protein which is putatively in part of the
receptor binding site. Furthermore, analysis of the HA cleavage site amino acid sequence, a marker for
pathogenicity in chickens and turkeys, shows a progression toward a cleavage site sequence that fulfills the
molecular criteria for highly pathogenic AIV.
Avian influenza virus (AIV), a type A influenza virus, espe-
cially in its highly pathogenic (HP) form, can cause a devas-
tating disease in poultry, resulting in severe economic losses.
Of the 15 hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes of influenza virus, H5
and H7 are considered to be the most important in gallina-
ceous poultry, as only these subtypes have been associated with
HP AIV (reviewed in reference 1). Importantly, HP AIV is
considered exotic to the United States; however, low-patho-
genic avian influenza H7N2 subtype viruses have been rou-
tinely isolated from the live-bird market (LBM) system in the
northeastern United States since 1994 (13, 14) and are be-
lieved to be linked to two outbreaks in commercial poultry in
Pennsylvania, the first from 1997 to 1998 (22) and the second
from 2001 to 2002, and to an outbreak of H7N2 AIV in the
spring of 2002 in Virginia, West Virginia, and North Carolina.
This study characterizes the HA and neuraminidase (NA)
genes from H7N2 AIV isolates obtained from the premises of
LBMs and poultry farms or isolated from birds at LBMs and
poultry farms in the northeastern United States between 1994
and 2002. The full coding regions of the HA gene of 54 H7N2
isolates and only the HA1 region of an additional 4 isolates
were included as well as 45 NA subtype 2 genes. LBM isolates
obtained from 1994 to 1998, initially characterized by Suarez et
al. (17), were also included in the study with the addition of the
full coding sequences for the HA and the NA genes.
Phylogenetic analysis was performed with PAUP 4.0b10 (Si-
nauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, Mass.) with the maximum
parsimony tree-building method by heuristic search with 500
bootstrap replicates. Phylogenetic analysis of the HA gene of the
H7N2 viruses revealed a close relationship, probably representing
a single lineage and a chronological assortment among the iso-
lates (Fig. 1). The isolates from the AIV outbreaks in Pennsylva-
nia (from both 1997 to 1998 and 2001 to 2002) and the outbreak
in Virginia, West Virginia, and North Carolina in 2002 were
clearly derived from the LBM H7N2 lineage. This relationship is
supported by the NA phylogenetics also, although the early NA
genes assort into several groups (Fig. 2).
A 24-nucleotide (nt) deletion resulting in an eight-amino-acid
deletion from residues 212 to 219 in the HA1 segment, first
reported by Suarez et al. (17), was present in all isolates from the
LBM lineage obtained since 1996 and in all isolates from AIV
outbreaks in commercial poultry in Pennsylvania, Virginia, and
North Carolina. Based on the structure of the H3 HA gene (20),
this deletion removes five of six consecutive amino acids in part of
the receptor binding site. The nucleotide sequence similarity be-
tween viruses with and without the deletion is high. Therefore, the
HA gene with this deletion arose from the H7 subtype viruses
circulating in the LBMs at the time and was not a separate
introduction of a different HA gene with a deletion.
Four different NA stalk lengths were observed during the
sample period. Isolates with a full-length protein were only
seen prior to 1996. The largest deletion was in TK/NY/4450-
5/94, which had a stalk deletion from nt 142 to 211, resulting in
a loss of 23 amino acids. Another isolate, QU/PA/20304/98,
had a stalk deletion from nt 142 to 199. A fourth group, which
was phylogenetically distinct and which contained most of the
N2 isolates obtained since 1997 from the LBMs and commer-
cial poultry outbreaks, had a 51-nt deletion between positions
164 and 211 (17 amino acids) and was phylogenetically distinct
from earlier N2 genes. Based on the deletions and sequence
variation, it appears that four separate NA genes were intro-
duced between 1994 and 2002 by reassortment into the LBM
H7 virus lineage, with a single gene lineage becoming domi-
nant after 1997.

Although the HA1 stalk deletion is unique to this lineage,
deletions in the NA stalk region have been observed in other
AIVs isolated from poultry; however, the positions and lengths
of the deletions vary among isolates (3, 21). NA stalk deletions
have been shown to reduce the enzymatic activity of the pro-
tein (10) and, presumably, adversely affect the spread of the
virus to uninfected cells. Compensatory changes in the HA
gene have been described, including decreases in receptor

binding affinity arising from increased glycosylation near the
receptor binding site (11, 19). The presence of an eight-amino-
acid deletion in a region of the HA1 segment that putatively
corresponds to the receptor binding site (based on the struc-
ture of the H3 HA gene) (20) has been reported only in this
lineage (17, 18) and may represent a novel compensatory mu-
tation for the NA stalk deletion. The impact this deletion may
have on HA binding needs to be investigated further. Interest-
ingly, both the HA and NA stalk deletions were first observed
in isolates obtained in 1996.
Compared to several other viruses in poultry, the LBM-
lineage H7N2 viruses have circulated for a relatively long pe-
riod of time in chickens and turkeys without becoming HP. In
some previous reports, low-pathogenic H5 or H7 AIV circu-
lated in commercial poultry for at most 2 years after they were
first detected before mutating into the HP form (2, 3, 5–7). The

HA cleavage site sequence has been well characterized as an
indicator of pathogenicity, where multiple basic amino acids
are associated with high pathogenicity (4, 9). Throughout the 8
years during which H7 influenza viruses have been consistently
isolated from the LBMs, five different HA cleavage site se-
quences have been observed (Table 1). The earliest isolates
(from 1994 to 1998) had two basic amino acids; in 1998 isolates
with three basic amino acids were observed and became the
predominant sequence, and then in early 2002 isolates with
four basic amino acids were observed. It has not yet been
determined if the sequence with four basic amino acids will
become the predominant sequence. In H7 subtype viruses, five
or more basic amino acids would likely result in a phenotype
for high pathogenicity (15). Importantly, all of the LBM-lin-
eage H7N2 isolates that have been characterized, even those
with four basic amino acids, have been of low pathogenicity in
chickens (data not shown).
Finally, reassortment in the matrix and nonstructural genes
has a similar pattern to that of the HA and NA genes. Previ-
ously, it was shown that the matrix and nonstructural genes
were reassorting fairly often in viruses isolated before 1997
(17). However, both genes became stably associated in the
H7N2 lineage after 1997, with no further evidence of reassort-
ment (data not shown). The stable combination of these four
gene segments after 1997 suggests that this constellation of
genes offers some selective advantage to the virus in this envi-
ronment, particularly when AIVs of as many as nine different
subtypes other than H7N2 have been isolated in the LBM
system since 1994 (12). Isolates of non-H5 and non-H7 sub-
types from the same time period have not been well charac-
terized by sequencing.
Because the H7N2 viruses have continued to circulate in the
LBM system for more than 8 years with consistent monitoring,
the LBMs provide a unique opportunity to observe the evolu-
tion and ecology of the influenza virus in a nonnatural avian
host. The LBMs also provide a somewhat unique environment
for the evolution of AIV through the poor bio-security that
results from housing multiple avian species (and sometimes
mammalian species) in close contact and from a constant influx
of new and susceptible birds. The markets likely provide a
direct route for AIV transmission to poultry from waterfowl,
which are one of the natural host reservoirs of type A influenza
virus (8, 16).
