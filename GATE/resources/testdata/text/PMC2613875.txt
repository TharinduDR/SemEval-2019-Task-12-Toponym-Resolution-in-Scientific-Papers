Abstract
Background: Vampire bats are important rabies virus vectors, causing critical problems in both
the livestock industry and public health sector in Latin America. In order to assess the
epidemiological characteristics of vampire bat-transmitted rabies, the authors conducted
phylogenetic and geographical analyses using sequence data of a large number of cattle rabies
isolates collected from a wide geographical area in Brazil.
Methods: Partial nucleoprotein genes of rabies viruses isolated from 666 cattle and 18 vampire
bats between 1987 and 2006 were sequenced and used for phylogenetic analysis. The genetic
variants were plotted on topographical maps of Brazil.
Results: In this study, 593 samples consisting of 24 genetic variants were analyzed. Regional
localization of variants was observed, with the distribution of several variants found to be delimited
by mountain ranges which served as geographic boundaries. The geographical distributions of
vampire-bat and cattle isolates that were classified as the identical phylogenetic group were found
to overlap with high certainty. Most of the samples analyzed in this study were isolated from
adjacent areas linked by rivers.
Conclusion: This study revealed the existence of several dozen regional variants associated with
vampire bats in Brazil, with the distribution patterns of these variants found to be affected by
mountain ranges and rivers. These results suggest that epidemiological characteristics of vampire
bat-related rabies appear to be associated with the topographical and geographical characteristics
of areas where cattle are maintained, and the factors affecting vampire bat ecology.

Background
Rabies is a fatal infection of the central nervous system
caused by being bitten by a rabid animal. The vampire bat,
which has a distribution extending from Mexico to Argen-
tina, is an important rabies vector in the region. Out-
breaks of rabies in livestock transmitted by vampire bats
were first observed between 1906 and 1908 in the State of
Santa Catarina in Brazil, when approximately 4000 cattle
and 1000 horses and mules died due to paralytic rabies
[1]. To date, cattle losses attributed to vampire bat trans-
mitted rabies have had a marked economic impact on the
livestock industry in the areas [1-3]. In addition, out-
breaks of human rabies transmitted by vampire bats in the
Amazon regions of Brazil are an important public health
consideration [4-6].
The vampire bat is a non-migratory colonial species that
roosts in natural shelters or in shelters associated with
human habitation [7]. Since vampire bats feed on mam-
malian blood, the distribution of vampire bat popula-
tions is affected by food availability and the distribution
of livestock and cattle in particular [7,8]. Consequently,
the occurrence of rabies within vampire bat populations is
very closely reflected by the incidence of rabies in cattle
[3,9,10].
Vampire bat-related rabies viruses have been genetically
typed as being a species-specific variant [11]. To date, sev-
eral rabies virus variants have been identified based on
geographic distributions, which possibly reflects their
association with bat ecology [12-14].
Attempts to control the transmission of vampire bat-
transmitted rabies by reducing the vampire bat popula-
tion using warfarin and vaccinating livestock against
rabies are regularly conducted in Brazil [1,2]. Knowledge
of the epidemiological characteristics of vampire bat-
transmitted rabies is thus important for assessing the effi-
cacy of these control measures against rabies transmission
by bats. In order to assess the epidemiological characteris-
tics of vampire bat-transmitted rabies, the authors con-
ducted phylogenetic and geographical analyses using
sequence data of a large number of cattle rabies isolates
collected over a wide geographical area in Brazil.
Methods
The 570 rabies virus isolates genetically analyzed in this
study were collected from cattle in the city of Brasília in
the Federal District (DF) (n = 2), and the States of Goiás
(GO) (n = 320), Maranhão (MA) (n = 18), Minas Gerais
(MG) (n = 3), Mato Grosso do Sul (MS) (n = 64), Mato
Grosso (MT) (n = 72), Pará (PA) (n = 1), Paraíba (PB) (n
= 5), Rio de Janeiro (RJ) (n = 46), São Paulo (SP) (n = 22),
and Tocantins (TO) (n = 17) between 1987 and 2006
(Accession numbers: AB307066–AB307631, AB377125–
AB377128). In addition, 96 rabies virus sequences, which
were analyzed in previous studies [11,12,15], were
obtained from isolates of rabid cattle in the DF (n = 1),
and the States of GO (n = 32), MA (n = 1), MT (n = 26),
MG (n = 4), PB (n = 14), PA (n = 1), Rondônia (RO) (n =
1), SP (n = 9), and TO (n = 7) (Accession numbers:
AB083799, AB083803, AB083805, AB083809,
AB083813, AB083814, AB083818, AB206423–
AB206436, AB246194–AB246210, AB246213–
AB246248, AB246250–AB246267, AB246268–
AB246270, AB307065). Eighteen rabies virus sequences
were obtained from vampire bats in the States of GO (n =
10), RJ (n = 3), and SP (n = 5) as described previously
(Accession numbers: AB201803–AB201805 and
AB297632–AB297646) [16,17]. The nucleotide
sequences of BRdg10 and BRdg603 isolated from Brazil-
ian dogs were obtained from GenBank (Accession num-
bers: AB083796 and AB263334) [18].
Viral RNA was extracted from the brains of cattle diag-
nosed as being rabies positive by both the direct fluores-
cence antibody test and the mouse inoculation test
[19,20]. The mice were housed and handled with ethical
principal under the committee of University of São Paulo.
RT-PCR and sequencing methods were as described previ-
ously [12]. A 203 nt region corresponding to the nucleo-
protein gene located between nucleotide 109 and 311 of
the PV strain was analyzed as this locus has been
employed to demonstrate association with the phyloge-
netic divergence of clusters in previous phylogenetic stud-
ies [11,21].
Multiple alignment and phylogenetic analysis were per-
formed using the Clustal × program [22]. Phylogenetic
trees were generated with the p-distance model using the
neighbor-joining method of Saitou and Nei [23] and the
Mokola virus was used as an outgroup (Accession
number: Y09762). The statistical significance of the con-
structed phylogenies was estimated by bootstrap analysis
with 1000 pseudoreplicate datasets. Bootstrap values
exceeding 70% were considered to indicate phylogenetic
association [24]. The TREEVIEW program was used to
obtain a graphical output [25] and nucleotide sequence
identities were calculated using BioEdit software [26]. The
geographic origins of the sequenced Brazilian cattle and
vampire bat rabies isolates were plotted at the municipal
level of the respective federal states using MapInfo Profes-
sional GIS software (ver. 8.0 software MapInfo Japan K.K.,
Tokyo, Japan).
Results
Brazilian rabies viruses could be divided into two phylo-
genetic groups, dog- and vampire bat-related rabies virus
variants (Fig. 1). Almost all (99.2%) of cattle isolates ana-

lyzed in this study were identified as being the vampire
bat-related rabies virus variant, which consisted of a large
number of phylogenetic lineages, the other five cattle
samples collected from the States of GO, MA, MT, and SP
during 1995–2004 were characterized as being dog-
related rabies virus variants.
To assess geographical distribution pattern of the virus,
vampire bat-related cattle isolates belonging to clusters
with bootstrap values at the shared internal branches of
lineages exceeding 70% (Fig. 1), and clusters consisting of
more than five samples with 100% nucleotide similarity
were plotted on topographical Brazilian maps. Conse-
quently, 593 samples belonging to 24 clusters, C-1 – C-
24, were mainly analyzed and plotted in maps (Fig. 2, 3,
4). The nucleotide sequence identities among 24 clusters
ranged between 93.1 – 99.5%. C-1 – C-3, C-9, C-11, C-15,
C-22 and C-23 consisted of several lineages with boot-
strap values exceeding 70%. The nucleotide sequence
identities within these clusters ranged between 97.5 –
99.5%, and the distributions of the samples belonging to
these clusters were observed to overlap (Fig. 2).
Most of the samples analyzed in this study were found
along rivers, and a large number of samples characterized
as the same variant were observed to be distributed along
the same river (Fig. 3). Although the distributions of sev-
eral clusters overlapped, regional variations in the distri-
butions of these clusters were observed in Brazil (Fig. 2).
C-2, C-8 and C-9 were mainly distributed in the northern

and C-24 in the central regions, and C-4, C-15 – C-19 and
C-23 in the southern regions of Brazil. In other 86 cattle
samples which were not categorized by the above-men-
tioned method, the distributions of the samples with
100% similarity were also observed in adjacent geo-
graphic areas (data not shown).
The distributions of several clusters were separated by geo-
graphic boundaries such as mountain ranges. For exam-
ple, mountain ranges in the States of GO, MT and MS were
observed to separate C-24 in the north and northwest, C-
10 – C-12 and C-14 in the southwest areas, C-5 and C-20
– C-22 in the northeast areas, and C-13, C-16 and C-19 in
the southeast (Fig. 2). In addition, the distributions of C-
1, C-3, C-5 and C-22 were affected by the mountain
ranges in the eastern areas of the State of GO (Fig. 3-F). C-
21 localized in a region between two mountain ranges in
the State of GO. C-4 and C-17 were mainly distributed in
the State of RJ, and were surrounded by the mountain
ranges in the States of MG, SP and RJ with altitudes of 800
m above (Fig. 3-D).
Elevations in distribution regions of clusters defined in
this study were various heights. For example, C-5, C-7, C-
11, C-12, C-14, C-19 and C-23 were dispersed in moun-
tain regions at altitudes 1000 m above to its surrounding
lowland regions at altitudes 100 m below (Fig. 3). C-2, C-

4, C-9 and C-22 were distributed in lowland regions at
altitudes less than 300 m, and C-6 was primarily distrib-
uted at an altitude of 700 m in mountainous area of the
State of GO (Fig. 3-F).
The effect of the different Brazilian biomes on the distri-
bution patterns of bat rabies isolates was also assessed
(Fig. 4). C-2, C-9, C-11, C-12, C-14, C-19 and C-24 were
found to be distributed across several regions with differ-
ent biomes, while other clusters tended to be restricted to
regions with a particular biome.
Using the above-mentioned method of categorization, the
10 vampire bat isolates in 18 categorized were genetically
classified as falling into C-4, C-5, C-7, C-15 and C-23. The
distributions of the vampire bat isolates belonging to C-5,
C-7 and C-23 overlapped with cattle isolates of the same
lineage (Fig. 3-C, D, F). Although vampire bat isolates
belonging to C-4 were isolated in remote areas several
tens-of kilometers from the geographic origins of cattle
isolates belonging to the same lineage, several vampire
bat and cattle isolates were distributed along the same
river (Fig. 3-D). A vampire bat isolate belonging to C-15
was isolated in adjacent geographic areas where the cattle
isolates were classified as the same variant (Fig. 3-C).
The number of cattle isolates of C-2, C-6, C-17 and C-20
in remote areas was small compared to the size of the
groups from the principal distribution regions (Fig. 2).
While the majority of the samples belonging to C-6 and C-
20 were mainly distributed in the mountain regions of the
State of GO, one sample belonging to C-6 originated from
the central lowland region in the State of MT and one sam-
ple in C-20 from the southeastern region of the State of PA
were also observed. While C-17 consisted mainly of sam-
ples from the State of RJ, one sample was derived from the
southern area of the State of SP. Similarly, while C-2 pri-
marily contained samples from the northern lowland
areas of TO, one sample was derived from the southeast-
ern mountainous region of MT.
Discussion
The previous research reported the existence of nine
regionally-defined rabies virus variants in Brazilian vam-
pire bats [12]. The distribution patterns of these variants
were observed to differ with respect to the geographic ori-
gins of the viruses and suggested that the epidemiological
characteristics of the rabies virus variants were associated
with the ecology of the bat populations.
Vampire bats usually select the shorter routes between the
roost and their preferred prey, often traveling several kil-
ometers one-way to find prey [7]. In addition, although
vampire bat population in a colony remains relatively sta-
ble, they regularly visit neighboring roosts within activity
area of ranges of 10 to 20 km2 [7,9,27]. This tendency to
visit neighboring colonies promotes indirect communica-
tion between almost all of the colonies within an area
forming a loosely defined assemblage or network [28].
Given these aspect of bat ecology, the spread of rabies in
this species is mainly due to contact between the infected
individuals of one colony and the susceptible individuals
of another [8,28]. Rabies outbreaks in vampire bats have
been observed to move slowly at an average rate of 40 km
per year [3].
Although the categorization of a genetic group employed
in this study differed from that employed previously [12],
a large number of regionally-differentiated rabies virus
variants were identified, and were widely distributed in
both previously-studied and new areas of Brazil. The dis-
tributions of the variants identified in this study were
observed to differ between regions in Brazil and tended to
be separated by mountain ranges, which corroborated the
observations of Kobayashi et al. and Velasco-Villa et al
[12,13]. In addition, since the distributions of the classi-
fied genetic variants from both vampire-bat and cattle iso-
lates were found to overlap relatively closely, the
epidemiological characteristics of cattle rabies are mark-
edly similar to those of vampire bat rabies, with the
genetic diversity between these variants attributed to
aspects related to bat ecology and the topographical fea-
tures of the habitat. Consequently, it appears that the
rabies viruses might be circulated among bat populations
inhabiting in contiguous areas, and although the variant
distributions may change slowly over time, natural barri-
ers such as mountain ranges may play an important role
in delimiting rabies foci, resulting in regionally-differenti-
ated rabies virus variants. A similar geographic orientation
has been observed in rabies virus variants transmitted
within populations of other non-migratory bat species,
i.e. Eptesicus fuscus in North America [29].
The authors previously reported that genetic variants of
vampire bat-related rabies in mountainous regions were
correlated with altitude [12]. However, in this study, sev-
eral variants were observed to disperse across of the poten-
tial altitude barriers defined previously, moving from high
altitude mountainous regions to lowland. In addition, the
distributions across several distinct biomes were also
observed. Vampire bats utilize rivers to move between
areas, and paths of outbreaks have been observed to fol-
low tributaries and splits in the river due to the abundance
of suitable roosts and caves along their banks [28]. Con-
sequently, the presence of rivers and adequate shelter has
been recognized as important considerations underlying
the incidence and spread of vampire bat-transmitted cattle
rabies. Most of the samples analyzed in this study were
isolated from adjacent areas linked by rivers, which agreed
with epizootic observations in cattle rabies. In addition, a

large number of samples characterized as the same variant
that was distributed along the same river. These findings
suggest that the distribution patterns of variants may cor-
relate with the behavior of vampire bats, and that the
spread of the virus is associated with bat migration.
In this study, a small number of variants were isolated in
areas that were relatively remote and removed from the
principal areas. Similarly, distribution patterns of the
virus have been also observed that appear to indicate the
movement of either vampire bats or infected animals
across several Brazilian regions [14]. 86 of the samples in
this study could not be categorized as genetic variants, and
surveillance of cattle rabies has not yet been performed in
several Brazilian regions. Subsequent epidemiological
studies are, therefore, necessary in order to assess the tem-
poral and spatial characteristics of the bat rabies distribu-
tion and also to obtain additional detailed
epidemiological information related to bat rabies.
Since the epidemiological characteristics of vampire bat-
transmitted rabies in cattle may be associated with topo-
graphical and geographical features of the areas where cat-
tle are maintained as well as aspects of bat ecology, it is
important that these factors are considered in plans
directed at mitigating the spread of bat-transmitted cattle
rabies.
Conclusion
The present study revealed that several dozen of region-
ally-defined rabies virus variants associated with vampire
bats exist in Brazil, and that areas where rabies occurs were
affected by mountain ranges and rivers. These findings
suggest that epidemiological characteristics of vampire bat
rabies may be influenced by the topographical and geo-
graphical features of the areas in which cattle are main-
tained as well as aspects related to bat ecology.
Consequently, the authors propose that these factors
should be considered in measures directed to control the
bat-transmitted cattle rabies.
