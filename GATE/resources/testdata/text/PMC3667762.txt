Abstract
West Nile virus (WNV), an arbovirus maintained in a bird-mosquito enzootic cycle, can infect other vertebrates including
humans. WNV was first reported in the US in 1999 where, to date, three genotypes belonging to WNV lineage I have been
described (NY99, WN02, SW/WN03). We report here the WNV sequences obtained from two birds, one mosquito, and 29
selected human samples acquired during the US epidemics from 2006–2011 and our examination of the evolutionary
dynamics in the open-reading frame of WNV isolates reported from 1999–2011. Maximum-likelihood and Bayesian methods
were used to perform the phylogenetic analyses and selection pressure analyses were conducted with the HyPhy package.
Phylogenetic analysis identified human WNV isolates within the main WNV genotypes that have circulated in the US. Within
genotype SW/WN03, we have identified a cluster with strains derived from blood donors and birds from Idaho and North
Dakota collected during 2006–2007, termed here MW/WN06. Using different codon-based and branch-site selection models,
we detected a number of codons subjected to positive pressure in WNV genes. The mean nucleotide substitution rate for
WNV isolates obtained from humans was calculated to be 5.0661024
substitutions/site/year (s/s/y). The Bayesian skyline
plot shows that after a period of high genetic variability following the introduction of WNV into the US, the WNV population
appears to have reached genetic stability. The establishment of WNV in the US represents a unique opportunity to
understand how an arbovirus adapts and evolves in a naı̈ve environment. We describe a novel, well-supported cluster of
WNV formed by strains collected from humans and birds from Idaho and North Dakota. Adequate genetic surveillance is
essential to public health since new mutants could potentially affect viral pathogenesis, decrease performance of diagnostic
assays, and negatively impact the efficacy of vaccines and the development of specific therapies.

Introduction
West Nile virus (WNV; genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae) is a
mosquito-borne virus that is maintained in a bird-mosquito
enzootic cycle, and is considered the most widely distributed
flavivirus in the world [1,2]. WNV can infect a broad range of
vertebrate species including horses and humans which are
considered dead-end hosts [3]. Most human infections (,80%)
are asymptomatic, and symptomatic infections vary from mild flu-
like illness (,20%) to fatal neuroinvasive disease (,1%) [4]. WNV
is estimated to have infected ,4 million humans in the United
States (US) between 1999 and 2011, causing over 31,000 serious
illnesses, including 13,243 neuroinvasive disease cases and 1,261
deaths reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/westnile).
Historically, two major genetic lineages of WNV have been
reported: lineages I and II [5,6]. New WNV lineages have been
proposed based on phylogenetic analysis of complete or partial
genomes of new isolates, and the virus has been postulated to have
up to five distinct lineages [7–9]. Clade 1a of lineage I contains
isolates from Africa, Europe, the Middle East, Russia, and the
Americas, and includes all recent isolates from US outbreaks [10].
In recent years, recurrence of the transmission of WNV to humans
in Europe has intensified, where strains from both lineage I and II
have been reported to be in circulation, and where lineage II
WNV has been linked for the first time to neuroinvasive disease
[11–14].
During 1999, the first cases of WNV in the Americas were
reported in New York City. Analysis of WNV sequences from
human cases from the 1999 epidemic revealed that these strains
PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | www.plosntds.org 1 May 2013 | Volume 7 | Issue 5 | e2245
belong to WNV lineage I, and that US genotype was subsequently
named genotype NY99. The strains from the WNV NY99
genotype have been considered to have a Middle Eastern origin
because of their close relationships to a strain isolated from Israel
in 1998 (IS-98 STD) [15]. Subsequently, extensive phylogenetic
analysis has suggested that both the US and Israeli WNV strains
have an African origin [10].
In 2001, a new genotype (termed WN02) emerged in the US
becoming increasingly prevalent in 2002, and eventually displac-
ing the ancestor genotype NY99 [16,17]. The WN02 genotype is
characterized by 13 conserved silent nucleotide mutations
including 1 amino acid (aa) substitution (V159A) in the envelope
protein (E) gene [16]. The new genotype became dominant in the
Americas presumably due to its ability to disseminate more
efficiently in domestic Culex pipiens and Culex tarsalis mosquitoes as
compared to the NY99 genotype [18,19].
The genomic RNA of WNV is approximately 11 kb in length,
and contains 10 genes within a single open reading frame (ORF)
that encodes for a single polyprotein, flanked by 59 and 39
untranslated regions (UTR). The approximately 3,400 aa WNV
polyprotein is processed by cellular proteases and by the viral
NS2B-NS3 protease into 3 structural (C-prM-E) and 7 non-
structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and
NS5) [20]. Genetic variation in flaviviruses can occur via single
base mutations, small insertions and deletions within the linear
evolutionary pathway of the virus lineage, and more rarely by
recombination events [21]. Viral adaptation through fixation of
spontaneous mutations is considered an important factor poten-
tially associated with recurrence of WNV outbreaks in the New
World [22].
In this study, we examined the genetic variation and evolution-
ary processes acting upon WNV strains sampled in the US from
different hosts including birds, mosquitoes and humans, and
performed comparisons on the phylogeny and natural selection
pressure using complete sequences from the US available in the
GenBank database. We report here a new cluster termed MW/
WN06, positioned within the recently described genotype SW/
WN03, which consists of isolates obtained from human and bird
specimens collected from Idaho and North Dakota in 2006–2007.
Persistence of the transmission of strains from cluster MW/WN06
in the Midwest region of the US, as well as phenotypic
characteristics such as virulence and dissemination capacity of
those strains needs to be further studied.
Methods
Ethics statement
All human specimens used in this study originated from blood
donors who signed the blood center’s Institutional Review Board
(IRB) approved informed consent and tested reactive in nucleic
acid assays used to screen donations for WNV RNA. Prior to
shipment, these specimens were anonymized (unlinked). Use of
these already-existing unlinked specimens has been approved as
exempt by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) IRB
(Human Subjects Research - Exempt RIHSC Protocol #127B).
Samples
A total of 32 WNV isolates were sequenced and included in this
study. Twenty-nine (29) were obtained from human plasma
samples derived from blood donors who tested reactive for WNV
RNA by FDA-approved commercial nucleic acid test assays used
to screen blood donations. These specimens were randomly
selected from our repository and cover 12 states of the continental
US: Arizona (AZ), California (CA), Colorado (CO), Idaho (ID),
Louisiana (LA), North Dakota (ND), Nevada (NV), New York
(NY), Mississippi (MS), South Dakota (SD), Texas (TX) and Utah
(UT), spanning from 2006–2011. Of the remaining three isolates
included here, two were from avian specimens from ID and one
from a mosquito pool from NY. These specimens were positive for
WNV by RT-PCR performed at their respective state department
of health laboratories and were provided to us as field specimens
for genetic studies. All isolates had the complete open reading
frame sequenced and were included for analysis (Table 1 and
Table S1).
Viral isolation, RNA extraction and Reverse Transcription-
Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)
Virus isolation was performed in African green monkey kidney
(Vero) cells (ATCC # CCL-81) as described previously by Grinev
et al. [22]. A single Vero cell passage was performed to expand the
virus in order to obtain the required RNA concentration for
sequencing purposes. Cell culture supernatants were harvested
when extensive cytopathic effect was observed, clarified by
centrifugation to remove cell debris and frozen at 280uC until
further analysis. Cell culture supernatants (140 ml) were subjected
to RNA extraction using the QIAamp viral RNA extraction kit
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Extracted RNA was stored at 280uC until further analysis.
Reverse transcription reactions and PCR amplification were
performed as described previously [22].
DNA sequencing
After agarose gel electrophoresis, PCR products covering the
entire WNV genome were purified using the MinElute Gel
Extraction Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions, and both strands were subjected to direct Sanger sequencing
using the amplification primers and additional internal sequencing
primers, with a minimum of 4X coverage. Sequencing reactions
were performed as described elsewhere [22]. Amplification and
sequencing primer sequences are available upon request from the
authors. Nucleotide sequences reported in this paper are available
Author Summary
West Nile Virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne virus of African
origin that is widespread around the world. The WNV life-
cycle involves mosquitoes and birds, but humans and
other animals can be infected, although they are not
considered to be important players in the transmission
cycle. Clinically, most WNV infections are unapparent, but
the virus can disseminate to the central nervous system
causing a potentially fatal neurological disease, especially
in susceptible populations including elderly and immuno-
compromised individuals. West Nile virus can also be
transmitted by organ transplant and by transfusion of
blood and blood components. Like other arboviruses, WNV
has the extraordinary capacity of growing in the different
microenvironments represented by the invertebrate vector
and the vertebrate hosts. From an evolutionary standpoint,
the arrival of WNV in the US in 1999 represents a unique
opportunity to explore the processes involved in the
adaptation and dissemination of an arbovirus in a naı̈ve
environment. From the study of WNV sequences, we can
not only learn about the evolutionary mechanisms that
govern arboviruses, but also update diagnostic tests that
rely on the detection of the viral genome upon the
occurrence of mutations and study the existence of
genetic markers that may be responsible for increases in
clinical cases and their severity.

and JQ700437–JQ700442).
Phylogenetic analysis
For the phylogenetic analysis, in addition to our newly
sequenced WNV strains from human origin (Hu-WNV), n = 29,
a search for fully sequenced WNV from the US in the GenBank
database was performed. All the WNV ORF (10,299 nucleotides,
nt) sequences available in the GenBank database as of January
2012 (,400 sequences) were retrieved and analyzed for the
presence of identical sequences that were subsequently removed to
avoid duplications in the successive analyses. Sequences known to
be laboratory strains (adapted to grow in either animals and/or
cell culture) and therefore subjected to artificial selection, as well as
sequences bearing at least one ambiguous nt reported in the ORF
of the virus were also excluded from the analyses. Additionally,
two WNV sequences of avian origin from Mexico which were
shown to be related to US strains were also included in the dataset.
The final dataset comprises a total of 363 WNV ORF sequences
constituted from strains derived from various hosts including birds
(n = 133), mammals (humans, n = 32; and a single sequence each
from horse and squirrel specimens) and mosquitoes (n = 167)
available in the GenBank, in addition to the newly sequenced
strains produced in our laboratory from human (n = 29) and avian
specimens (n = 2). For a complete list of strain names, host, state of
origin and GenBank accession numbers, see Table S1.
Maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian approaches (B) were
used to generate phylogenetic trees, using parental strain IS-98
STD (AF481864) as an outgroup to root the trees. The selected
strains were aligned using MUSCLE implemented in MEGA5
[23] and the ML analyses were conducted in PhyML [24].
Bayesian information criterion (BIC) was used to determine the
model of nt substitution that best fit the data using the selection
tool available in MEGA5. The model that best fit the data was the
General Time Reversible (GTR) + C + I model. For the analyses
performed in PhyML, the initial tree was generated by BIONJ
with tree improvement using Nearest Neighbor Interchange (NNI)
and Subtree Pruning and Regrafting (SPR) methods and
optimization of both topology and branch lengths. Branch support
was done by the approximate likelihood ratio test (aLRT) and
non-parametric branch support based on a Shimodaira-Hase-
gawa-like (SH-like) procedure [24,25], as implemented in the on-
line version of PhyML (http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/phyml).
Furthermore, the Bayesian inference method implemented in
the program MrBayes v3.1.2 [26] was used to analyze the WNV
dataset. For the substitution model, the General Time Reversible
(GTR) + C + I model was determined to be the best fitted for the
data based on Aikake information criterion scores calculated by
jModelTest 0.1.1 [27], and used with successive branch swapping.
Four Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains were run for
10,000,000 generations, sampling every 100 generations, with the
first 10,000 sampled trees discarded as burnin. Finally, a 50%
majority rule consensus tree was constructed from the posterior
distribution of trees.
Selection pressure analysis
We performed a comprehensive selection analysis in the ORF of
WNV strains isolated from all host species (ALL dataset) and from
a dataset containing only Hu-WNV (H dataset). Prior to the
selection analysis, recombination was assessed by the Recombi-
nation Detection Program v.4.13 [28] and no signals of
recombination were detected. In addition to the ORF sequence
datasets, the ALL and H datasets were further partitioned into
each of the 10 individual WNV protein genes and analyzed for
selection pressure. In order to analyze the natural selection
mechanisms acting on the codons of the ORF and each of the 10
individual genes of WNV we used the HyPhy (Hypothesis testing
using phylogenies) package under the Datamonkey web-server
(www.datamonkey.org) [29]. The dN/dS ratios (v) were calculated
using three different codon-based maximum likelihood approaches
(CBML): the single-likelihood ancestor (SLAC), fixed-effects
likelihood (FEL) and the internal branch fixed-effects likelihood
(IFEL) [30,31]. Due to alignment size restrictions from the server,
the random-effects likelihood method (REL) was only used to
evaluate the H dataset.
The mixed effects model of evolution (MEME) method, a
branch-site model, was also employed for studying the selection
pressure in the different host datasets. This method is a
generalization of FEL, which models variable v across lineages
at an individual site being able to detect smaller proportions of
branches evolving subject to positive selection that would

otherwise be detected as ‘‘negatively’’ selected by FEL [32,33]. For
all the methods employed for the ORF datasets, the GTR model
was used as nt substitution bias model, while for the individual
gene datasets the TN93 model was used. Trees were inferred by
the neighbor-joining method and significance levels were set to
p,0.1 or Bayes factor.50.
Time-scale analysis
Evolutionary rates for the Hu-WNV sequences (H dataset,
n = 61) were calculated by using the Bayesian MCMC approach
employed by BEAST ver. 1.6.2 [34]. The data were analyzed
using the TN93+C4 substitution model. We tested four parametric
demographic models (constant population size, expansion, expo-
nential and logistic growth) and the non-parametric Bayesian
Skyline plot (BSP) model, under both strict and relaxed
uncorrelated lognormal (UCLN) molecular clocks. Models were
compared by calculating the Bayes Factors (BF), which are the
ratio of the marginal likelihoods (marginal with respect to the
prior) of the models compared. For each coalescent model we
estimated the marginal likelihoods using the method described by
Newton and Raftery [35] and modified by Suchard et al. [36], and
evidence against the null model (model with the lower marginal
likelihood) was determined as previously described [37]. Four
MCMC chains were run until convergence to the stationary
distribution was achieved for each demographic and clock model.
Each independent chain was then combined with a burnin value
set to 10% generations. The maximum clade credibility tree
(MCC) was generated for each model. The 95% highest posterior
density (95% HPD) intervals were obtained to ascertain the
uncertainty in the parameter estimates.
Results
Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic analyses for WNV were performed by maximum-
likelihood and Bayesian methods. These analyses included WNV
sequences originating from avian, mosquito and human speci-
mens, as well as one sequence each from horse and squirrel
specimens available in the database (ORF, n = 363). The
phylogenetic trees generated with this dataset revealed the
presence of the clades (groups) already described during the study
of the evolution of WNV in North America
[10,15,16,18,20,22,38–43] (Figure 1A and Figure S5).
Phylogenetic analyses revealed that a total of 50 sequences
clustered within the parental genotype NY99, which included
strains collected from states located on the East and Gulf coasts,
spanning from 1999–2003. The intermediate group, a cluster
basal to the WN02 genotype [16,18] included sequences from
Florida (FL), LA and CT collected from 2000–2003. Strain TX04,
reported previously to possibly be a recombinant strain of NY99
and WN02 genotypes [44], was also found located basal to the
WN02 genotype.
Phylogenetic trees were constructed with the ALL dataset and
color-coded according to year (1999–2011) and place of collection
(US regions: Northeast, South, Midwest and West) and are
available as Figures S1 and S2. The phylogenetic trees revealed
that WNV sequences present a bush-like topology, i.e. in general,
they are constituted by poorly differentiated clades with only a few
clusters found to be geographically and/or temporally structured
(Figure 1A). In addition, there is no clear host-origin (avian,
mosquito, human, and other mammals) segregation of the strains
in the constructed phylogenies (Figure S3). It is possible to note
that most of the WNV sequences from the US available in the
GenBank database originated from the states of NY, CT and IL,
where tremendous efforts have been conducted to analyze the
genetic composition of the WNV strains circulating there.
The genotype WN02 is constituted from samples collected from
diverse regions of the US. Dispersed throughout the genotype
WN02, we observed a number of WNV strains obtained from
humans (Hu-WNV), including those that we are reporting here for
the first time, grouping within several sub-clusters distributed
across the phylogeny (Figure 1A). The Hu-WNV strains reported
here are indicated in the text in italics and bold font. These Hu-
WNV isolates located within genotype WN02 are positioned
within six sub-clusters termed here clusters ‘‘1’’ to ‘‘6’’. We found
that a single Hu-WNV strain (BSL24-11 from CA) collected in
2011 was associated with the cluster containing the CA group
(cluster D in the classification of Gray et al. [41]); termed here
cluster ‘‘3’’, which is constituted by strains sampled between 2003
and 2008. Thus this finding supports the notion that viruses from
this cluster were still circulating in CA as late as 2011 (Figure 1A).
Previous analysis of the entire ORF of WNV isolates circulating
in the Southwestern US (especially from TX) has shown that a
new genotype had emerged in the region after 2003, termed
genotype SW/WN03, for which five phylogenetic groups have
been described before [43]. We have observed that some of the
Hu-WNV isolates reported here clustered within the SW/WN03
genotype: BSL2-09 and BSL6-09 from NV in groups 2 and 4
(according to the classification in [43]), respectively, and BSL4-11
from AZ in group 2. Group 5 of SW/WN03 was constituted by
the largest number of strains within this newly described genotype,
comprising strains from AZ, CA, CO, NM and TX and spanning
from 2004–2008. We have identified 7 of the Hu-WNV strains
sequenced here to cluster within group 5 of genotype SW/WN03:
BSL176-08 and BSL11-09 from NV, BSL173-08 and BSL5-09
from AZ, CO5-07 from CO, BSL33-06 from UT and BSL23-06
from ID (Figure 1B).
Of particular interest is the observation that five Hu-WNV
strains from ID from 2006–2007 (ARC10-06, ARC13-06,
ARC17-06, ARC27-06, ARC140-07), one Hu-WNV strain from
ND from 2006 (ARC106-06), as well as two avian-WNV strains
from ID collected in 2007 (ID21_bird and ID28_bird), clustered
together and formed a distinct phylogenetic cluster within group 5
of SW/WN03, which has been termed here MW/WN06, after
being described in the Midwestern US after 2006 (Figure 1B).
Cluster MW/WN06 is particularly interesting from a phylogenetic
perspective since it presents clear spatial and geographical
structure, which is supported by high bootstrapping and Bayesian
posterior probability values. This cluster is constituted by strains
that were sequenced in an effort to study an ongoing epidemic in
Midwestern states during 2006 and 2007, and included six human
isolates and two bird isolates, thus representing viruses circulating
in the competent host for that location.
Bayesian maximum clade credibility trees constructed with Hu-
WNV from the US (n = 62) allow for the identification of the
NY99, WN02, SW/WN03 genotypes and the clusters already
recognized by the Maximum-likelihood analysis for the sequences
reported here, i.e., clusters ‘‘1’’ to ‘‘6’’ in the WN02 genotype and
cluster MW/WN06 in the SW/WN03 genotype, with high
posterior probability values (Figure S4).
Nucleotide changes and amino acid substitutions
When analyzing the nt and aa variation in the ORF of WNV
for the whole set of 363 North American isolates, we found that
overall, out of 10,299 nt, a total of 2,472 nt were polymorphic
(24%), of which 1,186 (47.97%) were single polymorphisms, while
1,286 polymorphic sites (52.03%) were shared by 2 or more
strains. Despite having 2,472 nt changes observed, only 492 of the

3,433 WNV-encoded aa (14.33%) were polymorphic, 331 of
which were single polymorphisms (67.27%), leaving only 161 aa
residues polymorphic for at least 2 of the 363 analyzed strains. As
expected, most of the nt changes we found were silent transitions
(U«C, A«G), accounting for <88% of the observed substitu-
tions. Nucleotide mutations conserved in the studied Hu-WNV
isolates compared to the complete genome of NY99 are shown in
Table 2. There are between 9 and 25 nt differences among all
human WNV isolates analyzed and the parental NY99 strain. All
29 Hu-WNV isolates completely sequenced here shared 5 nt
mutations (T1442C, C2466T, A4146G, C6138T and T8811C), that are
fixed in these Hu-WNV strains throughout 2006–2011 (Table 2).
The substitution T1442C is the only non-synonymous mutation
leading to the aa change E-V449A (V159A, in the E protein aa
numeration). This substitution is present in all WNV strains
sampled in the US since 2003, and therefore fixed in all members
of the WN02 and SW/WN03 genotypes (Table 2).
Surprisingly, nt changes from the parental genotype NY99
thought to be fixed and therefore supposed to be present in all
WNV circulating the US after the emergence of genotype WN02,
were found to be present in recent isolates reported here, i.e.
C660T in the prM gene which was found as C660 in 8 Hu-WNV
strains from 2009–2011, while C1974T in the E gene was found as
C1974 in most of the analyzed samples collected after 2007 (present
in 16 of the 29 Hu-WNV isolates reported here), prompting us to
speculate that these sites reverted back to the parental genotype
NY99 or represent strains that continue to circulate and that retain
vestigial characteristics of the NY99 genotype despite the presence
of genetic features considered distinctive of the WN02 genotype
(i.e. the presence of T1442C, with the subsequent aa change V449A
in E) (Table 2).
In the sequenced Hu-WNV, the number of deduced aa
substitutions ranged from 4 to 13 when compared with NY99,
most of which were conservative changes. In addition to the aa
substitution E-V159A in the Envelope protein common to all
WN02 genotype viruses, 17 Hu-WNV isolates from 2006–2011
shared the substitution NS4A-A85T. Interestingly, the aa change
NS4A85 ART is found in all sequences clustering in the SW/
WN03 genotype, except for strains BSL13-05 and BSL173-08,
which have an ARI substitution. Sixteen (16) of 29 Hu-WNV
isolates reported here shared the substitution NS5-K314R, while
for one strain (BSL24-09) the non-conservative NS5-K314E was
identified (Table 2).
Selection pressure analysis
The dN/dS ratios (v) for the ALL and H datasets were 0.105
and 0.127, respectively, suggesting that WNV is subjected to
strong purifying (negative) selection, as has been previously
observed for other flaviviruses like Dengue virus [45,46]
(Table 3). For the ALL dataset, which contains 363 strains
isolated from mosquito, avian or mammalian hosts, we found
evidence, supported by at least 3 methods, of positive selection in 5
codons in the WNV ORF (938-NS1147, 1841-NS3336, 2209-
NS4A85 and 2842-NS5314), while only 2 codons (1841 and 2209),
were detected as having been positively selected for the Hu-WNV
dataset (H dataset) under the same stringent analysis conditions
(Table 3). Additional, more inclusive analyses of selection pressure
were conducted including the recently developed MEME model (a
branch-site method), for which results suggest that a larger number
of sites in the WNV genome may be subjected to positive pressure
and may have been evolving under episodic directional selection
[32] (Tables S2–S4).
In the analysis of selection pressure of the individual genes
(gene-by-gene), for the ALL dataset, the structural protein genes
(C, prM, E) and the non-structural protein NS2B were the only
genes that did not reveal codons detected to be under positive
selection by at least two of the employed methods. The remaining
WNV non-structural protein genes had one or more sites detected
under positive selection by at least two of the employed methods
(Table S3). When selection pressure was analyzed gene-by-gene in
the H dataset, one codon each for the E, NS1, NS3 and NS4A
genes, and five sites in the NS5 gene were found to be subjected to
positive selection by at least two of the methods employed in the
Datamonkey server (Table S4). Codon 85 in NS4A was also found
to be under positive selection when we performed a gene-by-gene
selection pressure analysis of the H dataset using the Bayesian
empirical method employed in the Selecton server [47], with the
M8, beta + w. = 1 evolutionary model (data not shown).
Furthermore, we conducted an additional selection pressure
analysis in datasets of WNV sequences segregated by avian and
mosquito-host origin. For these datasets, a number of sites were
also found to be subjected to purifying selection. In some
occasions, positively detected sites were only found in one host-
origin dataset but not in the other (e.g. a codon found positively
selected with strong statistical support in the mosquito or avian
dataset that was not identified in the rest of the datasets) (Table
S2), which may be a signal of modest host-specific positive
selection bias occurring for certain codons during the diversifica-
tion of WNV in the US. Taken together, the results from our
natural selection analysis for WNV in the US suggest that the
number of positively selected sites detected with statistical
significance varies depending upon the host origin and the
number of sequences analyzed.
Time-scale analysis
The evolutionary rates for WNV were determined for the H
dataset (US human origin WNV strains + strain IS-98 included as
an outgroup, n = 62), using both strict and relaxed molecular
clocks, 4 parametric demographic models and the non-parametric
BSP model. An attempt to perform a similar time-scale analysis for
the ALL dataset failed to converge after more than 46108
generations, which as has been noted before, seems to be due to
computational constraints [41].
Results for the evolutionary time-scale analysis for the H dataset
are summarized in Table S5. To assess the population dynamics
for this dataset, we compared results on the parametric and the
BSP models, where the BSP with the relaxed molecular clock
(UCLN) was found to be the best-fitted model based on results on
the BF comparison of the marginal likelihoods for the models
assessed. Under this model, we calculated the mean nucleotide
substitution rate (MNSR) to be 5.0661024
substitutions/site/year
(s/s/y), 95% HPD = 4.44–5.7061024
s/s/y). The time to most

Evolution of West Nile Virus in the US, 1999–2011
PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | www.plosntds.org 7 May 2013 | Volume 7 | Issue 5 | e2245
recent common ancestor (tMRCA) for the whole dataset was 15.57
years ago (95% HPD = 14.23–16.98 years) or around 1995. Since
the analysis included the parental strain from Israel (IS-98 STD) as
outgroup, the calculated year (1995) corresponds to the tMRCA for
that strain (Table S5). In the case of US Hu-WNV strains
(including all genotypes), the mean tMRCA calculated was of 13.64
years ago (95% HPD = 12.77–14.64 years ago) or around 1997,
which is between 1–2 years before the virus was identified in the
US, more specifically in New York City during 1999.
A maximum clade credibility tree (MCC) derived from the
estimations obtained with the best models (BSP and UCLN) was
constructed and the age for each node is shown (Figure 2A).
Similar topology is observed in the MCC tree in comparison to
the maximum-likelihood and Bayesian consensus phylogenetic
trees constructed with the H dataset (data not shown). The mean
age for the WN02 genotype was calculated to be about 11 years
(or around 2000), which suggests that after the appearance of this
WNV genotype, in situ evolution has occurred independently in
several places. For the SW/WN03 genotype, the mean node age
is about 10 years (2001), and for the newly recognized cluster
MW/WN06, is of approximately 8 years. The Bayesian skyline
plot of Hu-WNV strains shows that after the identification of the
virus in the US in 1999, a period of high genetic variability was
observed until approximately 2002, which is congruent with the
observations of Snapinn et al. [17]. This high variability period
(period 1) was followed by a brief period of contraction, after
which another steep period of high variability (period 2) is
observed until around 2005, where the genetic diversity of the
WNV population infecting humans appears to have reached a
stability point (Figure 2B).
Discussion
Since 1999, WNV has spread from New York City throughout
the US and the Americas including Canada, Mexico, the
Caribbean, and more recently, South America [3]. Previous
studies have examined the evolutionary dynamics and spread of
WNV after its introduction in North America, which has been
described as a unique scenario to study the invasion and
adaptation mechanisms of a pathogen, more specifically a
flavivirus, to a naı̈ve environment [10,15,16,18,20,22,38–43].
This study focuses on the evolutionary processes (phylogeny,
selection pressure and evolutionary time-scale analysis) affecting
WNV strains circulating in the US since its identification in the
country in 1999 until the 13th
consecutive epidemic in 2011,
through the study of entire viral genome sequences (ORF), with
special emphasis on the study of sequences obtained from viremic
humans. After its arrival in the US, the parental WNV genotype
NY99 has evolved in situ, and starting in 2001, the new genotype
WN02 emerged and was reported to have completely displaced
genotype NY99 by 2003, after widespread distribution across
North America [22,43]. The bush-like topology of WNV
phylogenies suggests that the virus in the US has undergone
population expansion after a single viral introduction. This
phenomenon can be explained by the sudden pressure exerted
by ecological factors, i.e. the vector and host species, to which the
virus had to adapt in the US. The existence of in situ evolution of
WNV in different regions of the US has been demonstrated by
results obtained by us and others, and positive selection in sites
conferring increased viral fitness seems to have occurred. Positively
selected codons have been analyzed for their involvement in
generation of lineages, and this information can be found
accompanying the phylogenetic trees reported here (Figure 1).
Although temporal and geographical structure is clearly evident in
comprehensive sampled WNV phylogenetic reconstructions,
several studies have reported a lack of geographic structure in
the US based on phylogenetic analyses using prM and E gene
sequences [37–40,48]. Analyses using entire WNV genome
sequences have shown a better resolution of the geographical
structure of the strains than that obtained from partial genomic
sequence analysis [22,42–44]. However, the non-structural pro-
teins NS3 and NS5 genes have shown to provide phylogenetic
reconstructions close to those obtained when entire genomes or
ORF sequences are used [41].

Evolution of West Nile Virus in the US, 1999–2011
PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | www.plosntds.org 8 May 2013 | Volume 7 | Issue 5 | e2245
Our comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of WNV isolates from
the US demonstrates that with few exceptions, WNV strains from
the WN02 genotype circulating in the country are poorly
differentiated spatial and temporally, and these results correlate
with other recently published studies on WNV phylogeny in the
US [10,41,43]. The WN02 genotype differs from the NY99
genotype by only 1 aa substitution (E-V159A) and 13 silent nt
mutations [16]. We have found that two other aa substitutions
(NS4A-A85T and NS5-K314R) appear to have become fixed for
genotype WN02, and consequently are also fixed in the newly
reported genotype SW/WN03. Positive selection of these two aa
substitutions potentially could impact viral fitness, phenotype and
virulence.
WNV genetic variation in the US has been postulated to have
occurred in very defined geographical areas (‘‘niches of evolu-
tion’’), in which the variant viral strains accumulate genetic
changes while adapting to the local ecological conditions and may
either perpetuate in that area; where it could be disseminated to
other regions by migrating birds or other less understood
mechanisms, or become extinguished if sustained transmission of
such strains is not maintained [49,50]. Studies on the phylogeog-
raphy of WNV in the US [50] have shown a westward
dissemination of WNV lineages that matches the observed
spatio-temporal incidence of the virus and that some of the viral
lineages exhibit atypically rapid and long-distance travel. These
authors reported that the WNV epidemic in the US cannot be
adequately described by homogeneous dispersal, and instead
reported that it has been critically shaped by high variation in
dissemination of infected hosts.
We have identified and report here for the first time, a cluster of
WNV clearly defined spatially and temporally that grouped within
the genotype SW/WN03 and that is constituted by isolates from
human and birds circulating in the states of ID and ND during
2006 and 2007. We have termed this group as cluster MW/WN06
for the location of these states within the Midwest of the US. The
detected local concentration of closely related isolates in states of
the Midwestern US is likely due to initial introduction of one or
few genetically similar viral strains in the area with rapid spread to
mosquitoes and local birds, amplifying the initially carried genome
and thus human infections in that area would reflect the colonizing
genotype. Other places in the US for which in situ evolution and
dissemination have been reported include Texas and California
[43,51].The virulence of some of these lineages has been studied
and results indicate that localized selection for attenuated strains

[16,51,52]. The virulence of the MW/WN06 cluster is currently
unknown. Molecular epidemiology and virulence studies are
ongoing in order to determine the biological characteristics of
this genotype that appears to have emerged in situ and may have
the potential to expand further.
Analysis of WNV isolates sequenced in our study as well as
reports by others [22,43] indicate that although most new nt
mutations detected year-to-year are not fixed, WNV continues to
diverge in the US. The data showed that further genetic drift has
occurred in the US since our report in 2008 analyzing WNV
sequences collected from humans between 2002 and 2005 [22]. A
time-scale analysis of WNV was performed on sequences of the
entire ORF in WNV strains isolated from infected humans, mostly
from viremic blood donations collected throughout the US. For
this group of sequences we found a MNSR of 561024
s/s/y,
which is similar to what has been reported by May et al. [10],
where the MNSR among all isolates analyzed (including sequences
collected from various hosts and from all WNV genotypes
collected worldwide) was of 7.5561024
s/s/y, although substitu-
tion rates were found by these authors to vary when the
phylogenetic groups are compared to the others, ranging from
2.2461024
to 1.0661023
s/s/y. Other MNSR calculations for
WNV have been performed using either E [17,37,39,41] or the
non-structural proteins NS3 and NS5 gene sequences [41], mainly
derived from WNV sequences from mosquito and/or avian
specimens collected in the US. These studies revealed a broad
range of MNSR from 361024
to 861023
s/s/y depending upon
the host population, gene and coalescent parameters (demographic
and clock models) employed for the calculations. However, when
concatenated NS3 and NS5 protein genes were used to calculate
evolutionary rates and tMRCA, the analyses failed to converge
after 36108
generations, suggesting that current computational
resources are insufficient for large alignments [41].
RNA viruses exist in nature as ‘‘quasispecies’’, or more accurately
as mixtures of closely related but genetically diverse populations
upon which selection acts, and such degree of variation derives
from the relatively high replication rates, population size, and
error rates that occur during replication of their genomes by their
error-prone polymerases. The degree of diversity and the potential
for evolution within such a population at any given time is a
product of the balance between selection (positive or negative
pressures which impact the relative fitness of variants) and genetic
drift (the accumulation of random mutations during replication)
[53]. Despite the fact that numerous nt changes have been
reported during the course of WNV evolution in North America,
negative selection appears to constrain changes at the protein
level. A number of studies have shown only a low level of positive
selection in WNV isolates from North America [20,22,39,42]. The
low level of positive selection suggests that most aa changes in
WNV in North America have been the result of genetic drift.
We analyzed the selection pressure acting upon codons of the
WNV isolates collected in the US using codon-based methods
(FEL, IFEL, REL and SLAC), in addition to a recently developed
branch-site method (MEME). The MEME method is now
recommended over the traditional maximum-likelihood codon-
based methods since it appears to be superior to other methods for
identifying both episodic and pervasive positive selection [33],
which may have led in the past to underestimation of the number
of positively-selected sites in the studied WNV datasets. This
warrants further studies to analyze the biological significance of
these findings. There is evidence in favor of increased genetic
diversity in mosquitoes when compared to birds [37,38]. We have
observed indication of host-dependent selection pressure when we
conducted a separated selection analysis in host specific datasets of
WNV sequences (i.e. avian, mosquito, human and other mam-
mals). We speculate that this evidence supports the existence of
positive selection bias within different WNV hosts in the US, and
thus the study of such host-dependent selection constraints
warrants further investigation.
Two aa residues (NS4A85 and NS5314) found to be subjected to
positive selection in the ALL dataset were mapped to the phylogeny
and found to be involved in the formation of the SW/WN03
genotype, while two other residues, E431 and NS2A224 were found
in the California cluster within WN02, and in a number of NY99
and SW/WN03 genotype isolates, respectively. Sites NS4A85 and
NS5314 were found to be under positive pressure by both groups
([43] and our results). Armstrong et al. [44] reported positive
selection identified by FEL and SLAC at NS4A135, strong negative
selection in E159, and convergent or parallel evolution across viral
lineages by mapping aa substitutions to the WNV phylogeny, in
which it was noted that the same substitutions occasionally occurred
independently in different lineages. In that study, positive selection
at position NS4A-V135M was found to be present in sequences from
CT and TX, and it was speculated that this change has the potential
to alter RNA replication and interferon evasion mechanisms [44].
The observed positive selection at site NS4A-A85T, found in the
analyzed datasets in our study and by others [43], may also have the
potential to affect putative functions of the NS4A protein. In
addition, our analyses show that a number of codons in the NS5
protein are subjected to positive pressure (Tables S2, S3, S4). NS5 is
the viral RNA- dependent RNA polymerase; an enzyme that
exhibits extraordinary flexibility since it is subjected to very different
biochemical conditions while in either the arthropod vector or the
bird and mammal hosts. Single amino acid changes in NS5 have
been found to have an impact for WNV replication in different hosts
[54]. In this study, codon NS5314 was found to be subjected to
strong positive selection, and the effects of the selection of this codon
need to be studied in detail to elucidate its possible role for the
replication of WNV in the different natural hosts.
Our findings of Hu-WNV clustering within every genotype of
WNV and across the geography of the US, supports the notion
that although humans are considered dead-end hosts for WNV
and therefore thought not to play an important for the lifecycle of
the virus, human infections by the virus continue to occur and
represent an important risk for public health in general and for the
blood supply of the country. The expansion of WNV across the
US makes it necessary to analyze the genetic make-up of the virus
in the different localities in which the virus circulates. Viral
adaptation of WNV in mosquitoes and birds is considered to have
played a major role in the spread of WNV in North America; thus
additional studies are needed to further investigate phenotypic
differences of these circulating variants of WNV in vitro and in vivo
using mosquito and avian models. Furthermore, the establishment
of WNV in the US represents a unique opportunity to understand
how an arbovirus adapts to new hosts and spread in a naı̈ve
environment. Adequate WNV genetic epidemiological surveil-
lance is also essential for public health since new mutants could
potentially affect viral pathogenesis, decrease performance of
diagnostic and blood/organs screening assays, and negatively
impact the efficacy of vaccines and the development of specific
therapies.
