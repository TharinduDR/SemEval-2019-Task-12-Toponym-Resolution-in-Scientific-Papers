Objectives: The objectives of our large observational study were to describe the prevalence of
cardiac and noncardiac comorbidities in a community-based population of patients hospitalized
with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) at all medical centers in central Massachusetts, and to
examine whether multiple comorbidities were associated with in-hospital death rates and
hospital length of stay.
Methods: The study sample consisted of 2,972 patients hospitalized with AMI at all eleven
greater Worcester medical centers in central Massachusetts during the three study years of
2003, 2005, and 2007.
Results: The average age of this hospitalized population was 71 years, 55% were men, 93%
were Caucasian, and approximately one third had developed an ST segment elevation AMI
during the years under study. Hypertension (75%) was the most common cardiac condition
identified in patients hospitalized with AMI whereas renal disease (22%) was the most common
noncardiac comorbidity diagnosed in this study population. Approximately one in every four
hospitalized patients had any four or more of the seven cardiac conditions examined, while one
in 13 had any three or more of the five noncardiac conditions studied. Patients with four or more
cardiac comorbidities were more than twice as likely to have died during hospitalization and
have a prolonged hospital length of stay, compared to those without any cardiac comorbidities.
Patients with three or more noncardiac comorbidities had markedly increased odds of dying during hospitalization and having a prolonged hospital stay compared to those with no noncardiac
comorbidities previously diagnosed.
Conclusion: Our findings highlight the need for additional contemporary data to improve
the short-term outcomes of patients hospitalized with AMI and multiple concurrent medical
illnesses.

More than 140 million Americans have one or more chronic conditions.1 The number
of Americans living with multiple chronic conditions will continue to increase as
the population ages and fewer patients die from acute manifestations of cardiac and
noncardiac conditions.2–4 In general, and among patients with cardiovascular disease,
the presence of multiple comorbidities has been associated with increased mortality,
greater utilization of health care resources, and larger health care expenditures.5,6
Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death in Americans and is
associated with a high burden of comorbidities that play an important role in disease

progression and response to treatment.7–9 Although multiple
cardiac comorbidities have been associated with adverse
post-discharge survival rates in patients hospitalized with
acute myocardial infarction (AMI),10 important in-hospital
events, including mortality, length of stay, and use of different treatment approaches, have not been extensively studied
in patients with AMI according to the presence of multiple
cardiac or noncardiac comorbidities.11 The relative lack of
data on the magnitude and impact of multiple comorbidities
may limit our ability to further improve the targeting of
evidence-based therapeutics, thereby improving the outcomes
of patients hospitalized with AMI.
The primary objective of our study was to describe the
prevalence of cardiac and noncardiac comorbidities in a
community-based population of patients hospitalized at all
medical centers in central Massachusetts with AMI in 2003,
2005, and 2007. A secondary study objective was to examine
whether the presence of multiple cardiac and noncardiac
comorbidities was associated with the use of various treatment approaches, in-hospital mortality, and hospital length
of stay in patients hospitalized with AMI during the years
under study. Data from the population-based Worcester Heart
Attack Study were utilized for this investigation.12–14

Methods
The Worcester Heart Attack Study is an ongoing populationbased investigation examining long-term trends in the
incidence, hospital, and post discharge case-fatality rates of
AMI in residents of the Worcester, MA, metropolitan area
hospitalized at all greater Worcester medical centers on an
approximate biennial basis between 1975 and 2007.12–14 In
brief, computerized printouts of patients discharged from all
greater Worcester hospitals with possible AMI ­(International
Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision: [ICD 9] codes:
410–414, 786.5) were identified. Cases of possible AMI were
independently validated using predefined criteria for AMI.
These criteria included a suggestive clinical history, serum
enzyme level elevations in excess of the normal range at
each participating hospital, and serial electrocardiographic
findings during hospitalization consistent with the presence
of AMI. Patients who satisfied at least two of these three
criteria, and were residents of the Worcester metropolitan
area, were included.12–14
The present study population consisted of adult men
and women of all ages who were hospitalized with AMI in
2003, 2005, and 2007 at any of eleven medical centers in
the Worcester metropolitan area. As mentioned previously,
we carry out surveillance of this population on a biennial,

not an annual, basis. We restricted our study sample to this
relatively recent period because of the availability of data on
several important measures of cardiac and noncardiac comorbidity and to provide relatively contemporary insights into
the prevalence and impact of various comorbidities in this
patient population. This observational study was approved
by the Office for the Protection of Human Subjects in
Research and Institutional Review Board at the University
of Massachusetts Medical School.

Data collection
Trained nurses and physicians abstracted information on
patients’ demographic characteristics, medical history,
clinical data, and treatment practices through the review
of hospital medical records of patients with independently
confirmed AMI. These factors included patients’ history of
previously diagnosed comorbidities and AMI order (initial
versus prior) and type (ST-elevation myocardial infarction
[STEMI] versus non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction
[NSTEMI]).15,16 Data on treatment practices during hospitalization included the prescribing of six effective cardiac
medications (angiotensin converting inhibitors/angiotensin
receptor blockers, anticoagulants, lipid lowering agents,
beta blockers, aspirin, and thrombolytics) and two coronary
interventional procedures (coronary artery bypass grafting
[CABG], and percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI]).
The main outcomes of interest were in-hospital case-fatality
rates (CFRs) and hospital length of stay.
Comorbid conditions that had been previously diagnosed
in this patient population were categorized into cardiac
and noncardiac comorbidities. For purposes of the present
analysis we considered seven cardiac comorbidities, including atrial fibrillation, CHD (prior angina pectoris, CHD,
myocardial infarction [MI], CABG, or PCI), diabetes, heart
failure, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, and stroke.
The five noncardiac comorbidities that we examined included
anemia, depression, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). We
selected and categorized these cardiac and noncardiac
comorbidities based on a review of the prior literature, their
established associations with either the development of, or
prognosis after, AMI, and their relative frequency in this
patient population.10,17,18

Data analysis
We estimated the overall prevalence of individual comorbidities and multiple cardiac and noncardiac comorbidities in this patient population. We further categorized

Noncardiac comorbidities
Cardiac comorbidities

The study sample consisted of 2,972 residents of the
Worcester metropolitan area hospitalized with independently
validated AMI at all greater Worcester medical centers during 2003, 2005, and 2007. The average age of this patient
population was 70.8 years, 55.1% were men, and most were
white (92.5%). About one-third of patients presented with
a STEMI (31.6%), almost two-thirds had not experienced
a prior AMI (64.5%), and 9.7% died during their acute
hospitalization.
In examining differences in selected demographic and
clinical characteristics in relation to number of diagnosed
cardiac or noncardiac comorbidities (Table 1), patients with
multiple cardiac or noncardiac conditions were significantly

of comorbid conditions previously diagnosed based on the
review of information contained in hospital medical records.
Differences in patient demographic and clinical characteristics, cardiac medications and interventional procedures
received, and hospital CFRs and length of stay (LOS)
according to number of cardiac or noncardiac comorbid
conditions were examined using the Analysis of Variance
test for continuous variables and the chi-square test for
categorical variables.
Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed
to examine the association between number of cardiac and
noncardiac comorbid conditions and our principal study outcomes of in-hospital mortality (dead versus alive) and LOS
(.3 versus #3 days), while adjusting for several potential
confounding variables. These variables included patient age,
sex, race (white versus non-white), marital status, year of
hospitalization (2003, 2005, or 2007), and AMI order and
type. Sequentially, we began our multivariable adjustment
including only cardiac or only noncardiac comorbidities in
separate models. We then placed these cardiac and noncardiac
factors in a model concurrently to examine associations with
our principal hospital outcomes. Multivariable adjusted odds
ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the risk of
dying during hospitalization or having a prolonged hospital
stay according to the number of cardiac and noncardiac
comorbidities present were calculated in a standard manner. In addition, we examined the relations between various
combinations (ie, co-occurrence of specific conditions) of
multiple cardiac or noncardiac comorbidities and hospital
CFRs and LOS.

more likely to be older, female, unmarried, have a history
of prior MI, and present with a NSTEMI. These patients
were also more likely to have presented with higher serum
glucose levels, but lower estimated glomerular filtration
rate (eGFR) and serum cholesterol levels, at the time of
hospital admission than patients with fewer or no comorbid
conditions.

Prevalence of previously diagnosed
cardiac and noncardiac comorbidities
Among all comorbid conditions previously diagnosed at
the time of their hospitalization for AMI, hypertension
(74.9%) was the cardiac condition most commonly identified, whereas chronic kidney disease (21.7%) was the most
common noncardiac comorbidity diagnosed in this patient
population (Figure 1).
In our study population, 12.9% of patients had none of
the cardiac comorbidities examined, 19.8% had any one,
24.2% had any two, 18.7% had any three, and 24.6% had
any four or more of the cardiac conditions examined. In
terms of noncardiac comorbidities, 44.8% of patients had
none, 32.0% had any one, 15.6% had any two, and 7.6% had
any three or more of the noncardiac conditions examined.

Among all patients, 9.6% had neither of the cardiac nor the
noncardiac comorbidities studied, while 4.3% had $4 cardiac
and $3 noncardiac comorbidities.

Receipt of cardiac medications
and interventional procedures
and prior comorbidities
On average, patients received 4.2 of the six cardiac medications (angiotensin converting inhibitors/angiotensin receptor
blockers, anticoagulants, lipid lowering agents, beta blockers,
aspirin, and thrombolytics) examined during their acute index
hospitalization; 79.1% of patients received at least four of these
effective cardiac medications.
Each of these cardiac medications, with the exception of
thrombolytics, was prescribed to three-quarters or more of
patients hospitalized with AMI (Table 2). After multivariable
adjustment, patients with two noncardiac (OR = 0.72, 95%
CI = 0.53, 0.97) or three or more noncardiac (OR = 0.62,
95% CI = 0.42, 0.92) comorbidities were significantly less
likely to have received at least four of the effective cardiac
medications, compared with patients without any previously
diagnosed noncardiac comorbidity; however, no significant
differences in treatment practices were found according to

in this population.
Nearly one-half of patients underwent a PCI and 5.5%
underwent CABG surgery during their index hospitalization.
Patients were considerably less likely to have undergone a
PCI with increasing cardiac and noncardiac comorbidity
burden (Table 2). After multivariable adjustment, patients
with four or more cardiac comorbidities (OR = 0.59, 95%
CI = 0.41, 0.86) or patients with one noncardiac (OR = 0.67,
95% CI = 0.55, 0.82), two noncardiac (OR = 0.52, 95%
CI = 0.40, 0.69), or three or more noncardiac comorbidities
(OR = 0.35, 95% CI = 0.23, 0.52) were significantly less
likely to have undergone a PCI, compared with patients
without any previously diagnosed cardiac or noncardiac
comorbidity; however, no significant associations were
observed between the likelihood of undergoing CABG surgery according to the number of comorbidities present at the
time of hospitalization for AMI.

Hospital death rates and length
of stay and prior comorbidities
Having multiple cardiac or noncardiac comorbidities was
significantly associated with higher hospital CFRs and longer
LOS. There was a dose-response relationship between number
of cardiac or noncardiac comorbidities and in-hospital death
rates and LOS (Table 3, P for trend ,0.001). The hospital
CFR increased from 3.7% to 14.2% as the number of cardiac
comorbidities increased from zero to four or more conditions;
similarly, the hospital CFR increased from 6.9% to 15.9%
as the number of noncardiac comorbidities increased from
zero to three or more conditions. ­Approximately two-thirds
of patients with four or more cardiac comorbidities had a
LOS .3 days, compared with 39.8% of patients without
any cardiac comorbidity. Similarly, 70.7% of patients with
three or more noncardiac comorbidities had a LOS .3 days
compared to 47.8% of patients without any noncardiac
comorbidity (Table 3).
In multivariable logistic regression models adjusting
for the number of cardiac and noncardiac comorbidities
concurrently, patients with any two, three, or four or more
cardiac comorbidities were two to three times as likely to
have died during hospitalization, compared with those with
no cardiac comorbidities (Table 4). Patients with two noncardiac (OR = 1.63, 95% CI = 1.12, 2.37), or three or more
noncardiac comorbidities (OR = 1.76, 95% CI = 1.11, 2.78)
were also more likely to have died during hospitalization
compared with those without any noncardiac comorbidities.
In addition, we found that patients with any two, three, or

four or more cardiac comorbidities were at increased odds
of a prolonged hospital LOS (.3 days) compared with those
with no cardiac comorbidities (Table 4). Patients with any
one, two, or three or more noncardiac comorbidities were
also significantly more likely to have a prolonged hospital
course compared with those without any noncardiac comorbidities (Table 4).
We further examined the association between multiple
coexisting conditions and in-hospital mortality and LOS.
Due to the limited number of patients with certain comorbidity combinations, we focused on the three most common
combinations of previously diagnosed comorbid conditions.
The most frequent combination of two or more cardiac
comorbidities was “CHD + hypertension” (n = 340, 11.4%)
followed by “CHD + diabetes + hypertension” (n = 182,
6.1%) and “­diabetes + hypertension” (n = 156, 5.3%). Among
patients with these multiple comorbid conditions, 8.2%,

7.7%, and 9.6% of these patients, respectively, died during
hospitalization (all were not significantly different than the
overall hospital death rate of 9.8%), and 53.7%, 62.6%, and
55.1% had a LOS .3 days, respectively (all were not significantly different than the overall frequency of 56.1%).
Among those with two or more noncardiac conditions,
the most frequent combination was “anemia + CKD”
(n = 104, 3.5%), followed by “COPD + CKD” (n = 59, 2.0%),
and “COPD + depression” (n = 54, 1.8%). Among these
patients, 14.4%, 11.9%, and 14.8%, respectively, died during
hospitalization (all were not significantly different than the
overall hospital death rate of 9.8%), while 76.9%, 69.5%, and
70.4% had a LOS .3 days, respectively (all were significantly
[P , 0.05] higher than the overall frequency of 56.1%).

between 1990 and 2007.10 In that analysis, we showed that
hypertension and diabetes were the two most prevalent
conditions among these patients.10 The present results are
also consistent with the findings from other contemporary
investigations that have studied patients hospitalized with
AMI, including a community-based study from Kaiser
Permanente Northern California that demonstrated a high
burden of hypertension, diabetes, and CHD in this large
regional population.19 Since the burden of comorbid diseases
is associated with an increased risk of adverse outcomes, it is
important to recognize the frequency and importance of these
common comorbidities and take them into consideration in
examining differences in treatment practices and outcomes
in patients hospitalized with AMI.

Discussion

Factors associated with multiple
comorbidities

The results of this population-based observational study demonstrated that patients with multiple cardiac or noncardiac
comorbidities had a higher odds of dying during hospitalization for AMI and having a more prolonged hospital stay
compared to those with fewer or no previously diagnosed
cardiac or noncardiac conditions. Patients with multiple
cardiac or noncardiac comorbidities were significantly less
likely to have undergone a PCI than patients with fewer
comorbid conditions, but there were no significant differences
in medication treatment practices according to the number
of cardiac comorbidities present.

Prevalence of cardiac
and noncardiac comorbidities
In our study population, the vast majority (87%) had at least
one cardiac comorbid condition, whereas slightly more than
half (55%) had at least one noncardiac comorbid condition
previously diagnosed. More than one-half of patients had a
history of CHD or hypertension, and approximately one-fifth
had CKD. Among the seven cardiac comorbid conditions
examined, hypertension was highly prevalent, irrespective of
the number of cardiac comorbidities previously diagnosed,
whereas CHD and diabetes were highly prevalent among
patients with two or more cardiac comorbidities. Similarly,
among the five noncardiac comorbidities examined, CKD
was the most prevalent condition whereas anemia was
more prevalent among patients with two or more cardiac
comorbidities.
Our findings share similar patterns to the results of a
recent analysis from the Worcester Heart Attack Study that
examined trends in the frequency of multiple cardiovascular comorbidities among patients hospitalized with AMI

Clinical Epidemiology 2013:5

In a prior analysis of data from the Worcester Heart Attack
Study we found that older individuals, women, nonwhite,
and widowed patients were more likely to have multiple cardiovascular comorbidities previously diagnosed than respective comparison groups.10 In the present study, we extend
these findings by showing that similar patient demographic
characteristics were associated with multiple cardiac and
noncardiac comorbid conditions. In addition, we found that
patients with multiple cardiac or noncardiac comorbidities
were more likely to have developed a NSTEMI, have had a
prior MI, and have higher serum glucose, but lower eGFR
and serum cholesterol levels, at the time of hospital admission compared to those without any cardiac or noncardiac
comorbidities.

Hospital treatment practices
Characterizing the magnitude and profile of cardiac and
noncardiac conditions in patients hospitalized with AMI
may help explain differences in acute treatment practices and
inform the design of clinical guidelines and disease management practices that are beneficial to these complex and often
frail patients. The American College of Cardiology/American
Heart Association guidelines for the use of cardiac medications in patients hospitalized with AMI have recommended
the utilization of β-blockers and aspirin (1990), angiotensinconverting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (1996), and the use of
lipid lowering medications in the 2002 and 2004 guidelines
for the management of patients with NSTEMI and STEMI,
respectively.20–23 In the present study, beta blockers and aspirin were prescribed to the majority of hospitalized patients
whereas thrombolytic agents were rarely prescribed; each of

the other medications was prescribed to at least three quarters
of hospitalized patients.
We observed the frequent use of guideline-directed
­medications in the treatment of patients hospitalized with
AMI, irrespective of the number of cardiac comorbid conditions present. This finding may be due, in part, to a ceiling
effect since these cardiac medications were commonly prescribed to all patients hospitalized with AMI. However, our
analysis focused on the receipt of cardiac medications during
hospitalization for AMI in patients with different cardiac and
noncardiac comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes,
and CKD, which may have been differentially prescribed
to these patient subgroups in the outpatient setting. Further
studies should be carried out examining the number and
type of medications prescribed for outpatients with single
and multiple chronic comorbidities over the course of their
long-term follow-up visits.
Since patients with multiple comorbidities tend to be
older and sicker,10 we observed that patients were less likely
to have undergone coronary revascularization procedures
as the frequency of cardiac or noncardiac comorbidities
increased. Our results suggest that patients with multiple
comorbidities have a considerably different clinical presentation than those with fewer comorbid conditions, which may
make them less likely to receive evidence-based therapies
at the time of hospital admission and, by extension, increase
their risk of adverse outcomes. Our results, in combination with prior study findings, emphasize the importance
of developing clinical management guidelines specifically
tailored for hospitalized AMI patients with multiple cardiac
or noncardiac comorbidities given their high risk of adverse
outcomes.

Hospital outcomes
There are few published studies describing the relation
between multiple comorbidities and short- and long-term
outcomes among patients hospitalized with AMI. A recent
analysis of data from the Worcester Heart Attack Study
found that, among patients hospitalized with AMI between
1990 and 2007, those who had two or more cardiovascular
comorbidities were at higher risk for dying within 30 days
and at 1 year after hospital admission compared to patients
with no comorbid cardiovascular condition.10 A recent analysis of nearly 4,000 patients hospitalized with AMI from the
PREMIER-QI study at 19 US hospitals between 2003 and
2004 found that the presence of at least one acute noncardiac
condition was associated with a markedly increased risk of
dying during hospitalization.24

In the current study, we observed a dose-response
relationship between number of cardiac or noncardiac
comorbidities and in-hospital mortality and prolonged LOS.
Since clinical guidelines and disease management programs
typically focus on single conditions, and clinical research
often excludes persons with multiple chronic conditions, our
observation that patients with multiple cardiac or noncardiac
comorbidities were significantly more likely to have experienced adverse hospital outcomes suggests that current clinical
guidelines need to take into consideration the comparatively
poorer short-term outlook of these high-risk patients. The
lack of currently available evidence about the inpatient management of patients with multiple comorbidities reinforces
the development of contemporary treatment approaches to
improve the in-hospital and longer-term outcomes of these
high-risk patients.

Study strength and limitations
The strengths of the present study include its communitybased design, its large sample of patients hospitalized with
AMI, and its relatively contemporary perspective in examining clinically relevant outcomes and hospital treatment
practices according to the frequency of a number of important
cardiac and noncardiac comorbidities. Several limitations
need to be acknowledged, however, in the interpretation of the
present findings. First, since our study population included
only patients who had been hospitalized in the Worcester
metropolitan area, one needs to be careful to extrapolate
our findings to those who died before hospitalization or
to those who reside in other geographic areas. Second,
since the majority of our study participants were white, the
generalizability of our findings to other race/ethnic groups
may be limited. Lastly, there is the potential for unmeasured
confounding as we did not have information available on
several patient-associated characteristics, such as income,
education, and psychological factors, that may have affected
several of the endpoints examined.25

Conclusion
In this study of nearly 3,000 patients hospitalized with AMI
in central Massachusetts, we observed a high frequency of
multiple cardiac and noncardiac comorbidities. Presence
of multiple comorbidities was associated with a higher
likelihood of dying during hospitalization and being hospitalized for a more prolonged period. Given the aging US
population, the comorbidity burden in patients with acute
coronary disease will likely continue to increase. Our findings highlight the need for further contemporary data to help

guide the ­development of effective treatment modalities for
the comprehensive management of patients with AMI and
multiple concurrent medical illnesses with the long-term
goals of improving the prognosis and quality of life of these
individuals.
