Abstract The main reservoir of rabies virus in Poland has
been the red fox. To control rabies in wildlife, oral
immunization of foxes was introduced in 1993. The vac-
cine is effective when it confers immunity against the virus
circulating in the environment. To assess the above issue, a
study of the molecular characteristics of 570-bp fragments
of the N and G genes of vaccine strains SAD B19 and SAD
Bern against street virus strains was performed. The results
confirmed the similarity of the vaccine strains and rabies
virus strains circulating in the environment and also dem-
onstrate the genetic stability of vaccine strains that have
been distributed in Poland for 20 years.
Rabies, a fatal zoonosis caused by rabies virus (RV), a
member of the order Mononegavirales, family Rhabdo-
viridae, genus Lyssavirus, is distributed globally with the
exception of some islands, archipelagos and countries. In
Europe, wild animals, especially red foxes (Vulpes vulpes)
[11, 15, 18, 22] and raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyono-
ides) [5, 23], are the main reservoir of rabies virus. Ini-
tially, the control of rabies outbreaks in wildlife was aimed
at reduction of the fox population. That strategy has not
prevented the spread of the disease. Oral rabies vaccination
(ORV) of foxes is the only effective strategy for rabies
eradication in wildlife [4, 5, 10, 12, 16, 17]. All of the
commercially available oral vaccines, such as the modified
live RV vaccines SAD B19, SAD Bern, SAG-1 and SAG-
2, are derived from a common ancestor, the Street Alabama
Dufferin (SAD) strain, which isolated from a naturally-
infected dog in North America in 1935 [7, 13, 19]. Poland
started oral vaccination of foxes in 1993 with Fuchsoral. A
few years later, Lyssvulpen was introduced into the ORV
program.
Rabies virus encodes five structural proteins: nucleo-
protein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), gly-
coprotein (G) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L).
The glycoprotein is the main antigen capable of inducing
production of neutralizing antibodies (VNA)—a major
immune effectors against infection [2, 6]. The G protein is
also considered to play an important role in the patho-
genesis of rabies virus by presenting a determinant located
in antigenic site III.
The main objective of this study was to compare rabies
virus strains contained in the vaccines Fuchsoral (SAD
B19) and Lysvulpen (SAD Bern), which are used for ORV
of foxes in Poland, to rabies virus strains collected from the
field i.e. field (street) virus. The study was designed to
provide information on the efficacy of the vaccine strains
against the field viruses during the 20 year of rabies
eradication. At the same time, the genetic stability of the
vaccine strains was evaluated. Although the master seed
virus used for vaccine production undergoes only a few
passages in cell culture, making the risk of mutation is very
small if not negligible, field RV strains undergo passage in
animals of various species and therefore can escape from
the protection induced by oral vaccines.
To investigate the genetic compatibility of vaccine and
street RV strains, 50 vaccine samples (28 samples of SAD
B19 and 22 samples of SAD Bern) originating from various
batches of Fuchsoral and Lysvulpen and 44 Polish RV
isolates collected in Poland between 1992 and 2014 were
studied. Field samples were obtained from regional veter-
inary laboratories as brain samples that were positive for

rabies virus by fluorescent antibody test (FAT) [8] with
anti-nucleocapsid conjugate (Bio-Rad). As references,
strains SAD B19 and SAD Tübingen, purchased from the
WHO Reference Laboratory for Rabies (Pasteur Institute,
Paris, France), were used. A detailed description of rabies
virus strains included in the study is presented in Table 1.
Total RNA was extracted using a commercial kit QIA-
amp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. To amplify a 600-bp fragment
of the RV nucleoprotein gene, a previously published
method was used [20]. RT-PCR was carried out using the
primers JW12 and JW6DPL, which were described by
Heaton et al. [14]. A 590-bp fragment of the G gene cor-
responding to nt 3957–4547 of the PV reference strain
(accession no. M13215), encoding antigenic site III of the
RV glycoprotein, was amplified as described in a previous
paper (DOI 10.1007/S00705/014-2045-z). Following
amplification, PCR products were sequenced using an
automated sequencer (ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer,
Applied Biosystems) with a BigDye Sequencing Kit
(Applied Biosystems) and GeneScan Analysis Software.
The nucleotide sequences were assembled using CAP3
software. Multiple sequence alignments were done based
on the 570-bp regions of the nucleoprotein and glycopro-
tein genes. To assess the genetic compatibility of vaccine
and the street RV strains, the nucleotide sequences were
translated into amino acid sequences and aligned using
BioEdit software v. 7.0.5.3. Phylogenetic trees were gen-
erated using MEGA software v. 5.0 [21] using the neigh-
bour-joining (NJ) method with the Kimura 2-parameter
model. Bootstrap values were calculated for a set of 1000
replicates. Reference sequences of SAD B19 (accession no.
EF206709.1) and SAD Bern (accession no. EF206708.1)
were used for phylogenetic analysis.
The pairwise comparison of 570-nt-long N and G gene
fragments of vaccine strains SAD Bern and SAD B19 to
reference strains delivered from the Pasteur Institute
showed 100 % homology with the SAD B19 (CRBIP 8.17)
and SAD Tübingen (CRBIP 8.19) strains, with the excep-
tion of the SAD Bern/2006/2/POL Lysvulpen strain (batch
no. 713), which was distributed in Poland in 2006 and had
a single substitution of A to G at position 200 in the ana-
lyzed N gene fragment. Additionally, all of the vaccine
samples analyzed (SAD B19 and SAD Bern), irrespective
of their production date, had 99.8–100 % homology in the
analyzed 570-nt fragment of the N gene and 100 %
homology within the analyzed nucleotide sequences of the
G gene. Moreover, no differences in the nucleotide
sequences of the 570-long fragments of the N and G genes
were found between SAD Bern strains collected from the
Lysvulpen vaccine and SAD B19 strains collected from the
Fuchsoral vaccine. The SAD B19 and SAD Bern samples
were almost 100 % identical in sequence with the excep-
tion of the single nucleotide substitution in the above-
mentioned SAD Bern/2006/2/POL strain. This substitution
was nonsynonymous, and thus the amino acid sequence
identity was 99.8–100 %. Also, phylogenetic analysis of
the dataset from nucleotide sequences of vaccine strains
against reference sequences from GenBank and the strains
from the Pasteur Institute showed that all of the RV strains
extracted from Fuchsoral and Lysvulpen formed one group
of SAD vaccine virus strains based on the analysed frag-
ments of the N and G genes (Fig. 1).
Phylogenetic analysis of amino acid sequences within
antigenic site III of Polish field RV strains collected
between 1992 and 2014 and the vaccine strains isolated
from Lysvulpen and Fuchsoral distributed in Poland
between 1996 and 2014 showed a very high homology,
with the exception of a single substitution of isoleucine for
valine at position 136 in the amino acid sequence of the
M/2001/L1/POL strain. Figure 2 shows an alignment of the
amino acid sequences within antigenic site III. Based on
the analysed fragments of the RV genome and the corre-
sponding aa sequences, the results confirm a very high
compatibility of vaccine strains with the field strains.
The issue of the compatibility of the RV strains applied
in ORV and RV field isolates has become even more
important in relation to an outbreak of rabies that occurred
in Poland, in Malopolska voivodeship, in 2010. The region
had been free of rabies for 7 consecutive years. The ana-
lysis of the effect of ORV in Malopolska based on antibody
response (86 % seropositive reactors) and the rate of bait
uptake (tetracycline in fox bones, approx. 80 %) could
suggest that the rabies virus escape mutant appeared in the
field and that the vaccine does not protect animals against
the onset of rabies. From 20 August to 31 December 2010,
118 rabies cases were diagnosed, mostly affecting foxes in
a region that was temporarily free of rabies. The study has

confirmed the similarity of the attenuated vaccine strains
with rabies virus circulating in the field based on the aa
sequences of a fragment of the G protein that is crucial for
immunity against rabies. A detailed phylogenetic analysis
of a short fragment (570 bp) of the nucleoprotein gene of
field rabies isolates and the SAD Bern strain used for oral
vaccination in Malopolska voivodeship has excluded an
involvement of the vaccine strain in the rabies outbreak and
has shown a close relationship of Polish RV field strains to
Ukrainian and Romanian RV strains (NEE group). Further
PCR-RFLP analysis based on an N gene fragment con-
firmed that the Polish RV strains were field strains (data not
presented). Thus, the appearance of rabies epidemics in
Malopolska voivodeship appears to have resulted from
migration of rabid animals from outside of the region or
smuggling (illegal introduction) of rabid animals rather
than reversion of attenuated oral vaccines against rabies to
a pathogenic form. Detailed analysis of rabies epidemiol-
ogy has revealed that the rabies occurs in urban foxes, a
population that is beyond the reach of vaccines distributed
by plane. Thus, the responsible authority has decided to
distribute the vaccine by hand in urban areas. A pre-
liminary evaluation of the action that was taken has had
indicated an improvement of the epidemic situation
regarding rabies in Malopolska voivodeship.
Amino acid sequence the comparisons were carried out
for antigenic site III of the ectodomain of the rabies virus
glycoprotein. It is known that the ectodomain of rabies the
virus glycoprotein carries five antigenic sites and that sites
II and III are essential for pathogenesis and the stimulation
of production of rabies-virus-neutralizing antibodies [9].
Despite the fact that oral vaccines are intended for foxes,
the present study also involved RV strains isolated from
domestic animals because field strains can infect wild and
domestic animals. The study demonstrated almost 100 %
homology between vaccine strains and the Polish RV fields
strains within aa sequences of antigenic site III. A single
substitution of V by I in the Polish M/2001/L1/POL strain
was the only mutation observed in the 44 isolates that were
analyzed. This suggests that the SAD B19 and SAD Bern
vaccine strains are effective in rabies eradication and that
they should confer protection against the infection with
field viruses. Therefore, the hypothesis that RV field strains
are subjected to immune pressure from the immune pop-
ulation, resulting in the appearance of RV escape mutants

that are not compatible with the vaccine strains SAD B19
and SAD Bern, is not supported by the data.
A comparison of the nucleotide and amino acid
sequences of vaccine strains collected from the oral vac-
cines Fuchsoral and Lysvulpen showed 100 % nucleotide
sequence identity and 100 % homology to the reference
strains SAD Tübingen (8.17) and SAD B19 (8.19) obtained
from the Pasteur Institute. Although Cliquet et al. [3] have
pointed out the possibility of genetic modification of a live
rabies virus vaccine strain (marketed as the SAD Bern
strain) against reference vaccine strains, our results based
on two fragments of the N and G genes suggest that the
vaccine strains contained in the commercial vaccines retain
the characteristics of the master seed strains during serial
passages within the production cycle. Homology at the
level of 99.8–100 % was found between the SAD Bern and
SAD B19 strains within 570-nt fragments of the N and G
genes. This confirms the previously reported high
conservation and genetic stability of SAD B19 strains
passaged several times in mice [1]. It can be concluded that
the virus strains used for production of oral vaccines,
Fuchsoral and Lysvulpen, did not change during the years
1996–2014. The only change that was observed within the
N gene fragment in strain SAD Bern/2006/POL was a
single substitution of G for A at position 198. The
appearance of a non-synonymous mutation was surprising.
Unfortunately, information on the number of passages of
this particular batch of vaccine is not available. However,
according to the manufacturer’s declaration, the virus used
in the oral vaccine must not be passaged more than five
times. Thus, after careful consideration, we suppose that
the appearance of the mutation was rather random.
The genetic identity of the SAD Bern and SAD B19
strains is obviously due to the fact that they were derived
from a common ancestral SAD strain. The hypothesis has
been presented that SAD B19 and SAD Bern strains are the

same strain. Geue et al. [13] have shown close genetic
relationships (99.346–99.991 % homology) of five RV
vaccine strains collected from commercial vaccines dis-
tributed in Europe and a common origin from the same
strain when compared to the original archived vaccine
strains. In the present study, both of the analyzed fragments
of the N and G genes showed a high degree of conserva-
tion. Therefore, no differences within nucleotide sequences
between SAD Bern and SAD B19 strains were observed.
Rabies vaccines based on attenuated SAD strains are the
most frequently used in Europe for oral vaccination due to
their safety and good immunogenic properties, and for
economics reasons. This study demonstrates the molecular
compatibility of the vaccine strains with street RV strains,
confirming that SAD B19 and SAD Bern are still effective
in protection against field RV strains. The results demon-
strate the genetic stability of the strains used for the pro-
duction of a consecutive series of vaccines between 1996
and 2014 and also confirm that the vaccine is still potent
against current field viruses. Monitoring of the effect of
ORV in Poland has shown that, e.g., in 2013, around 77 %
of foxes submitted for testing were seropositive, and about
84 % of foxes contained tetracycline in their bones. Also,
epidemiological data showed a decrease in the number of
rabies cases, from 3084 in 1992 (before the start of ORV in
Poland) to 8 in 2009, confirming the efficacy and stability
of the vaccine strains. Thus, other factors, such as bait
integrity or the system of vaccine distribution (aerial dis-
tribution not reaching the urban foxes) have failed, playing
an important role in rabies outbreaks in southern Poland in
2010–2013. As of September 2014, Poland has recorded a
low number of rabies cases compared to the same period in
2012 and 2013.
