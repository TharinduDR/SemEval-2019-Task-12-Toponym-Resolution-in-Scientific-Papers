Here we report full-length sequencing of the first large set of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus genomes isolated in Finland be-
tween the years 2009 and 2013 and discuss the advantages and needs of influenza virus sequencing efforts.

Influenza A viruses (IAV) are globally distributed pathogens
causing annual epidemics and pandemics (http://www.who.int
/influenza/en/). So far, six pandemics have occurred (1). The latest
one was announced by the WHO in 2009 (http://www.who.int
/influenza/en/). The IAV genome consists of 8 single-stranded
RNA (ssRNA) segments and encodes 12 proteins: hemagglutinin
(HA), M proteins (M1 and M2), neuraminidase (NA), nucleocap-
sid protein (NP), nonstructural proteins (NS1 and NS2), and
polymerase subunits (PA, PA-X, PB1-F1, PB1-F2, and PB2). IAVs
are subtyped based on sequences of surface glycoproteins HA (H1
to H17) and NA (N1 to N9) (2, 3). The recent 2009 pandemic was
caused by the H1N1 subtype [A(H1N1)pdm09].
Here we report the whole-genome sequencing of 135 influenza
A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses isolated from nasopharyngeal aspirates
(NPAs) of Finnish patients from 2009 to 2013. The viruses from
NPAs were propagated in MDCK cells. RNA was prepared for
sequencing either by (i) sedimentation of the viruses from super-
natants, purification with an RNeasy Plus Minikit (Qiagen), re-
verse transcription to cDNA with SuperScript II reverse transcrip-
tase (Life Technologies) and random hexamers (New England
BioLabs), and preparation of an RNAseq library with Illumina
compatible Nextera Technology (Epicentre) (Genbank number-
ing starting with JQ) or by (ii) extraction of viral RNA with an
RNeasy 96 kit (Qiagen) and amplification with reverse transcrip-
tion (RT)-PCR as described previously (4). DNA libraries were
prepared using an Illumina Nextera DNA Sample Preparation kit
(GISAID and Genbank numbering starting with KF). Sequencing
was done using an Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencer (100-bp paired-
end reads, average 3,686,912 reads/isolate). Reads were aligned
with BWA software against the reference genome A/California/
07/2009. Alignment was cleaned using Picard and GATK toolkits
and analyzed with Samtools to detect variants. Sequences were
analyzed with BioEdit and ClustalW software.
All 135 genomes were unique compared to the reference strain
A/California/07/2009. Eight viruses that originated from subse-
quent samplings of four patients (two samplings per patient) dif-
fered in amino acid sequences, indicating fast mutation rates. In
total, 4,657 amino acid changes were identified. Viral HA, NA, and
PB2 were the most frequently mutated (1,111, 671, and 753 amino
acid substitutions, respectively). Several changes were identified at
the antigenic sites of viral HA (T89A, N142D, A158T, K180I,
D185N, G187R, S202T, A203T, N211S, S220T, and R238K; num-
bering with the signal peptide), which may allow viruses to escape
host immunity (5, 6). Polymorphism at HA D222 (numbering
without the signal peptide) was not detected (7). All virus isolates
had an amantadine resistance mutation (S31N) in the viral M2
protein. Oseltamivir resistance mutations were not detected; how-
ever, isolate A/Helsinki/598/2013 accumulated the amino acid
change E119K at NA during propagation. Mutations at the same
position (E119V) have already been linked to oseltamivir resis-
tance in the N2 subtype. Isolate A/Helsinki/P14/2009 encodes an
NS1 protein with a truncated C terminus (203 versus 219 amino
acids, confirmed by Sanger sequencing in the original sample).
Next-generation sequencing allows identification of IAV qua-
sispecies in patient samples. However, only the most dominant
variants are submitted to Genbank. We suggest that variants be
included in submitted sequences. This information could be used
to enhance preparedness for upcoming epidemics/pandemics.
Nucleotide sequence accession numbers. The whole-genome
sequences of 135 A(H1N1)pdm09 isolates from Finland (years
2009 to 2013) have been deposited in Genbank (accession no.
JQ409139.1 to JQ409246.1, JQ409131.1 to JQ409238.1,
JQ409123.1 to JQ409230.1, JQ173145.1 to JQ173152.1,
JQ173153.1 to JQ173160.1, JQ173161.1 to JQ173168.1, and
KF559358 to KF560309) and GISAID (isolate identification no.
EPI_ISL_145286 to EPI_ISL_145302).
