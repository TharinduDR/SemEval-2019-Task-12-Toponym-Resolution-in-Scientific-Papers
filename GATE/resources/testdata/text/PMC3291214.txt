Rabies was undetected in terrestrial wildlife of north-
ern Arizona until 2001, when rabies was diagnosed in 19
rabid skunks in Flagstaff. Laboratory analyses showed
causative rabies viruses associated with bats, which indi-
cated cross-species transmission of unprecedented magni-
tude. Public health infrastructure must be maintained to
address emerging zoonotic diseases.
In North America, >90% of cases of rabies in animals
occur in wildlife (1); several mammalian taxa harbor
characteristic rabies virus variants (RABVV). In Arizona,
skunks (Mephitis mephitis) and gray foxes (Urocyon
cinereoargenteus) maintain independent rabies enzootic
cycles, and in indigenous bats, rabies has been diagnosed
in 14 of 28 species (Arizona Department of Health
Services, unpub. data). Although skunks live throughout
Arizona, until 2001, rabid skunks had been found only in
the southeastern quadrant of the state.
In the United States, bat RABVV are a source of infec-
tion for humans and other mammals (2–8). Typically,
interspecies infection produces a single fatal spillover
event; secondary transmission has rarely been observed.
Antigenic typing of rabid carnivores in Arizona from 1996
through 2000 identified bat RABVV in 1 domestic dog and
2 gray foxes. This report describes the largest documented
rabies epizootic among terrestrial mammals infected with
bat RABVV, with perpetuated animal-to-animal transmis-
sion. Coincident with the zoonotic disease significance,
this report provides contemporary insight into pathogen
evolution (9).
The Study
In January 2001, a homeowner contacted Flagstaff
Animal Control about a dead skunk. Although no human
had been exposed to the skunk, tissues were submitted to
the Arizona State Health Laboratory, where rabies was
diagnosed. This skunk was the first rabid terrestrial wild
carnivore reported from the area. The Texas Department of
State Health Services subsequently identified an RABVV
associated with bats in tissues sent for antigenic character-
ization. From January through April, 14 more skunks, dead
or exhibiting abnormal behavior, were found throughout a
large residential subdivision within 4 km of the initial case.
All were infected with the same bat RABVV. From April
through July, 4 more skunks infected with bat RABVV
were identified ≈9 km west of the initial focus (Figure 1).
Control measures included prohibiting relocation of nui-
sance skunks, comprehensive public education, pet rabies
vaccine clinics, and a 90-day emergency quarantine requir-
ing pets to be leashed or confined and vaccinated (Figure
1). Additionally, 217 urban skunks were vaccinated and
marked with ear tags during a 6-month phased program of
trap, vaccinate, and release.
In Flagstaff and the surrounding county, during the
decade before this epizootic, 2 rabid bats, on average,
were reported each year. During the epizootic, 218 ani-
mals were submitted for rabies testing (Table). Rabies was
confirmed in 19 (13%) of 145 tested skunks and 2 (9%) of

22 tested bats. Although most (18 [95%]) of the rabid
skunks were identified and reported by lay citizens, no
contact between these skunks and humans or domestic
animals was reported.
Local baseline population estimates were not available
to indicate whether skunk demography affected disease
attributes. Synchronous with this outbreak, independent
epizootic activity caused by well-established skunk
RABVV was documented in southern Arizona, which sug-
gests that regional skunk epizootiologic dynamics were
similarly affected. Skunks’ seasonal behavior may have
contributed to transmission events. This epizootic was ini-
tially recognized when a dead skunk appeared in a snow-
covered backyard, during a season when skunks are in
communal dens. Given an incubation period of 2 months,
most transmission would have occurred between late
autumn (when skunks are in their dens) and late winter
(when they are mating).The Flagstaff epizootic peak coin-
cided with nationwide seasonal trends of rabid skunks (1).
Enhanced postepizootic surveillance in Flagstaff did not
detect additional rabid terrestrial mammals for the next 3
years. However, in 2004, a total of 5 skunks found in the
initially affected east Flagstaff neighborhood and 1 fox 28
km south of Flagstaff were infected with the same bat
RABVV (10).
Viruses isolated from the rabid skunks exhibited mono-
clonal antibody patterns similar to RABVV associated
with big brown (Eptesicus fuscus) and Myotis bats in the
western United States (11). These are among the most
abundant bat species in Arizona and often roost in houses
and outbuildings; however, no bat colonies were found in
association with any of the rabid skunks. Restriction
digests of PCR amplicons from the rabid skunks did not
match patterns known for RABVV from North American
terrestrial reservoirs (12). Phylogenetic analysis of a 300-
bp region of the N gene showed that the Flagstaff skunk
RABVV was identical (100%) to Arizona bat RABVV
(online Appendix Table, available from http://www.cdc.
gov/ncidod/EID/vol12no08/05-1526-appT.htm,and
Figure 2A), and differed by 22% from skunk and gray fox
RABVV. A monophyletic clade (clade A) of 8/8 big brown,
5/14 Myotis, and 1/6 southern yellow (Lasiurus ega) bats
shared >95% identity with Flagstaff skunk RABVV. An
additional 44 samples, representing 11 bat species, differed
by >8% from Flagstaff skunk RABVV.
An analysis of clade A, which incorporates N and G
genes, indicated that the Flagstaff skunk RABVV were
more closely related to 2 bat RABVV (E. fuscus from
Coconino County, M. velifer from Maricopa County) col-
lected in 1999 and 1997 than to the 2 bat RABVV collect-
ed locally during the outbreak. In clade B, subclade 1
RABVV were collected from January through early April

from the northeastern region of the outbreak, whereas sub-
clade 2 RABVV were collected from early March through
July from the southeastern and western regions of the out-
break (Figure 1). However, phylogenetic data do not sup-
port a wavelike spread from northeast to west because this
would require nesting of subclade 1 within subclade 2. In
contrast, both subclades exhibit independently derived
mutations. East-to-west epizootic movement of RABVV
within subclade 2 (sk16–19 form a monophyletic clade
nested within subclade 2) during April is supported by the
data and may be related to dispersal of infected skunks
along river corridors or translocation by humans. One per-
son reported trapping, moving, and releasing a skunk
before the outbreak was known in the community.
Alternatively, apparent shifts may be an artifact of intensi-
fied public awareness and reporting. Lack of sampling in
the uninhabited forest between the eastern and western foci
limits our ability to discriminate among these hypotheses.
Conclusions
This is the largest recorded cluster of bat RABVV
infection in terrestrial mammals. Investigation of this
novel outbreak showed evolution in action with the emer-
gence of an RABVV that successfully adapted from
Chiroptera to Carnivora. Previously documented clusters
involving 3–4 to terrestrial mammals infected with a single
insectivorous bat rabies virus variant did not corroborate
sustained transmission (12). Although >1 skunk may have
been exposed to a single rabid bat, it is highly unlikely that
each skunk was exposed to the same bat or that multiple
bat-skunk exposures occurred. We could not ascertain the
complete scope of this outbreak or whether it was the
index event. Phylogenetic analyses support the evolution
of 2 independent lineages, suggesting establishment for
months or years. Additionally, virus isolation from salivary
glands of 5 affected skunks and the reappearance of rabid
skunks with the same RABVV in 2004 support the proba-
bility of independent transmission.
The recognition of this epizootic can be credited to a
coordinated laboratory-based disease surveillance program
to monitor sick and dead wildlife for potential zoonoses
(plague, tularemia, rabies) even in situations lacking
human or pet exposures. Comprehensive animal disease
surveillance provides direct benefits to public health and
animal health by promoting early recognition of risk and
opportunities for disease control and prevention interven-
tions.
Unpredictable health threats related to emerging
zoonoses, especially those involving wildlife reservoirs,
pose notable surveillance and control challenges (13–15).
Recent bioterrorism initiatives emphasize integration of
human and animal disease surveillance, and enhanced lab-
oratory capacity, as essential functions in zoonosis detec-
tion (13). Rabies surveillance and control programs serve
as historic prototypes for effective, long-term, public
health programs. Quintessential zoonotic disease programs
require innovative and expanded capacities, commitments
to public health and veterinary laboratory infrastructure,
and appropriate interagency and interdisciplinary coordi-
nation and communication.
