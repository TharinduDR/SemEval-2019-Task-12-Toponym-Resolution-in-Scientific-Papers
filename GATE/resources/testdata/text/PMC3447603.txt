Although vaccination against influenza is recommended for elderly and high-risk patients in many countries,
efficacy in the elderly has been suboptimal. The MF59 adjuvanted trivalent inactivated vaccine (ATIV) was developed to increase the immune response of elderly subjects to influenza vaccination, but its effectiveness has
not yet been well documented. This prospective, observational study evaluated the relative effectiveness of ATIV
versus nonadjuvanted trivalent inactivated vaccine (TIV) in individuals at least 65 years of age in Lombardy,
northern Italy. Hospitalizations for influenza or pneumonia (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, codes 480–487) during the 2006–2007, 2007–2008, and 2008–2009 influenza
seasons were identified from administrative databases. Stratified and regression analyses, including the propensity score to adjust for confounding, as well as generalized estimating equations to account for repeated vaccination, were used. Overall, 107,661 records were evaluated, contributing 170,988 person-seasons of observation.
Since ATIV is preferentially recommended for more frail individuals, subjects vaccinated with ATIV were older
and had more functional impairment and comorbidities. In the primary analysis, risk of hospitalization for influenza or pneumonia was 25% lower for ATIV relative to TIV (relative risk = 0.75, 95% confidence interval: 0.57,
0.98). To the extent that there is residual bias, ATIV is likely to be even more protective than this result suggests.

Globally, inﬂuenza infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. In many countries, vaccination to prevent
inﬂuenza and its complications is recommended for “highrisk” groups, such as the elderly, patients with chronic conditions, and institutionalized populations. Nevertheless,
vaccination of the elderly remains controversial. Since there
is a gradual decline in immune competence with age (1–3),
immunogenicity and hence vaccine effectiveness in the
elderly are suboptimal. Assessment of effectiveness is complicated by the degree of match between vaccine and virus,
which varies from year to year with mismatches leading to
lower vaccine efﬁcacy (4, 5). Observational studies comparing vaccinated with unvaccinated cohorts have generally

found that conventional inﬂuenza vaccines are modestly effective in preventing hospitalization and mortality during
the inﬂuenza season (6). Controversies stem from the scarcity of data from randomized studies and the potential for
bias in observational studies due to differences in the baseline health status between those who are vaccinated and
those who are not (7, 8). It was therefore recognized that
the added value of a ﬁeld study would include only vaccinated persons in a head-to-head comparison, thus substantially reducing the potential for confounding.

persons 65 years of age or older. Clinical trials have shown
that MF59 adjuvanted vaccines are more immunogenic
than conventional nonadjuvanted vaccines and provide
better immunogenicity against drifted strains that are different from the virus strains included in the vaccine (9). Nevertheless, improved effectiveness in preventing inﬂuenza
and related complications has not been well evaluated in
the elderly (10).
The Italian National Health Care System provided an opportunity to evaluate comparative inﬂuenza vaccine effectiveness in a ﬁeld setting where medical data are accessible
and have been used for pharmacoepidemiologic studies
(11, 12). Italian guidelines on the prevention and control of
inﬂuenza provide free access to vaccines for high-risk
persons, with adjuvanted vaccines generally preferentially
recommended for more frail high-risk individuals (13). We
conducted a prospective, population-based cohort study,
known as the “Lombardy Inﬂuenza Vaccine Effectiveness”
(LIVE) Study, in northern Italy, of ATIV versus trivalent
inactivated vaccine (TIV) effectiveness during 3 consecutive inﬂuenza seasons starting in 2006–2007. Here, we
report the primary objective, which was to assess the relative risk of hospitalizations for inﬂuenza or pneumonia
during the inﬂuenza season in ATIV versus TIV vaccinees.
The secondary objectives, including an assessment of
safety and other secondary outcomes, will be reported
separately.
MATERIALS AND METHODS

Residents in the provinces of Cremona, Bergamo,
Mantova, Lecco, and Pavia in the northern Italian region of
Lombardy, who were at least 65 years of age and sought
inﬂuenza vaccination at local health authorities’ district
ofﬁces or participating general practitioners were eligible
for enrollment into this prospective cohort study during
each of the 3 vaccination seasons, 2006–2007, 2007–2008,
and 2008–2009. We excluded residents who were in the
hospital, nursing homes, or rehabilitation centers in the 30
days preceding immunization, as well as those receiving
home care or who were allergic to inﬂuenza vaccines.
Eligible subjects were informed by the vaccinators about
the study and asked for their consent to participate; all
those who accepted were administered a brief questionnaire
to record basic demographic data and information on potential confounders, including smoking status, conditions potentially affecting immune response, functional status (as
assessed through self-reported answers to questions about
physical capabilities), presence of children in the household, and receipt of an inﬂuenza vaccine the previous year.
Then they were administered either ATIV or the conventional nonadjuvanted trivalent subunit vaccine (Agrippal;
Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics), according to local,
regional, and national inﬂuenza vaccination policy recommendations. There was no attempt at random assignment of
vaccines. Information on the type of administered vaccine
was recorded for each participant by the vaccinators, along
with the previously collected information.
Both vaccines contained the recommended virus strains
for the respective inﬂuenza season in the Northern

Hemisphere. Vaccine doses were donated by the manufacturer and delivered to the local health authorities, who then
distributed them to their district ofﬁces or participating
general practitioners.
For each participant, residence status was conﬁrmed
through record linkage with administrative databases; all
linkage failures were excluded from the study. Additionally, the presence of chronic disease or other relevant routinely collected medical history information was ascertained
through record linkage with databases containing data on
hospitalizations (discharge diagnoses), outpatient drug prescriptions (active ingredient and estimated duration of treatment), receipt of ambulatory care with specialist, and
certiﬁed exemption from copayment of health-care costs.
The primary outcome was deﬁned as a hospitalization
for inﬂuenza or pneumonia occurring during a deﬁned
period in the inﬂuenza season (and in any case at least 3
weeks after vaccination), recorded in the hospital administrative database (discharge diagnosis with International
Classiﬁcation of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modiﬁcation, codes 480–487). Inﬂuenza season was deﬁned on
the basis of a nationwide surveillance network (“Inﬂunet”)
that monitors virologically conﬁrmed inﬂuenza occurrence
in Italy annually. The network includes 1,000 general practitioners and family physicians, and it provides weekly incidence data, stratiﬁed by age and region (14). We pooled
data over the 3 inﬂuenza seasons, such that our elementary
data record was a “person-season” at risk. As many people
were included for more than one of the 3 years of observation, we used generalized estimating equations (15, 16) to
take account of the correlation induced by measuring the
experience of the same people for more than one inﬂuenza
season.
Our case deﬁnition did not include positive laboratory
conﬁrmation of inﬂuenza virus. Therefore, in order to increase the speciﬁcity of the identiﬁcation of cases hospitalized for inﬂuenza-related conditions, we deﬁned 3 different
time windows during the inﬂuenza season in which hospitalizations were counted. The broadest time window corresponded to the entire inﬂuenza season, as determined from
Inﬂunet. The narrowest time window corresponded to the
period of adjacent weeks, around the peak inﬂuenza occurrence, having an inﬂuenza rate that exceeded 1 case per
1,000 person-weeks (17). An intermediate time window
was deﬁned in the same way but with a threshold of 0.5
case per 1,000 person-weeks. Although the broader
windows capture more cases, they are less speciﬁc for inﬂuenza-related cases. Accordingly, we deﬁned a priori our
primary analysis to be based upon the narrowest window as
it provided the greatest speciﬁcity and hence the least bias.
Also, in order to estimate the amount of potential misclassiﬁcation of the discharge diagnosis, a sample of hospital discharge records was validated, and the diagnosis was
compared with the actual hospital discharge diagnoses.
Since adjuvanted vaccine was preferentially recommended for high-risk frail individuals at many sites, it was
known a priori that analysis of study outcomes would have
to take this source of potential bias into account. To assess
and control for confounding, we used stratiﬁcation coupled
with Mantel-Haenszel summary estimates of a pooled

effect measure. Variables assessed as potential confounders
included age, gender, inﬂuenza season, local health authorities and vaccine provider, functional status, smoking,
recent infectious disease, transfusion, intestinal disorder,
self-reported ﬂu symptoms, cumulative length of stay in the
hospital and cumulative number of drug prescriptions (both
in the 5 years preceding the vaccination), infectious
disease, and chronic conditions, such as chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD), kidney disease, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, cancer,
and history of hospitalization for pneumonia, inﬂuenza, or
emphysema. Because of the number of potential confounders, we were not able to control for all confounders simultaneously in a single stratiﬁed analysis; we therefore also
conducted a multivariate analysis that used a propensity
score as a summary confounding score. For the propensity
score model, we used a logistic regression to estimate the
probability of receiving ATIV versus TIV. Variables that
were included in this model included age, sex, inﬂuenza
season, community and provider, cumulative length of stay
in the hospital, and cumulative number of drug prescriptions in the 5 years preceding the vaccination, physical impairment, smoking, presence of children in the home,
recent transfusion, recent intestinal disorder, recent selfreported ﬂu symptoms, recent infectious disease, history of
hospitalization for pneumonia, inﬂuenza or emphysema,
COPD, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney
disease, peripheral vascular disease, and cancer.
To avoid including in the propensity score model nonconfounding predictors of exposure, which would not
reduce confounding but would decrease precision, we ﬁt a
preliminary logistic model predicting hospitalization with
inﬂuenza-like illness that included all these covariates,
along with study vaccine, to determine the strength of relation of each variable with the study outcome. As a second
stage, we then created the propensity score model using
those predictors from the preliminary outcome model that
had a relative risk of at least 1.4: age, sex, inﬂuenza season,
community and provider, physical impairment, cumulative
length of stay in the hospital and cumulative number of
drug prescriptions in the 5 years preceding the vaccination,
history of hospitalization for pneumonia, inﬂuenza or emphysema, COPD, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, recent
infectious disease, and recent transfusion (18). From this
model, we computed the propensity to receive ATIV for
each person-season of observation and added that to the
data as an additional, derived variable. To improve comparability of the 2 vaccine groups, we controlled for the propensity score in multivariate models, but ﬁrst we excluded
all outlier observations (“trimming”), deﬁned as those
below the lower 2.5% of the tail of the TIV observations
(3,355 observations) and above the upper 2.5% tail of the
ATIV observations (2,894 observations). These tails are
outside the primary area of overlap of the propensity
scores, and they increase residual confounding in any type
of analysis (19).
In the multivariate analyses, we used generalized estimating equations to account for the inclusion of people in
more than one season. Our ﬁnal multivariate analysis was
based on doubly robust estimation, in which the strongest
Am J Epidemiol. 2012;176(6):527–533

confounders and the propensity score based on all confounders were included in the logistic model; this model in
principle should provide the best control of confounding
achievable with these data (20).
We conducted an additional analysis to compare the risk
of hospitalization before each inﬂuenza season in the 2
vaccine groups. We therefore identiﬁed the events that
occurred in the period May–September in people subsequently vaccinated and enrolled in the study. This was
done under the assumption that, if our model in the
primary analysis had completely adjusted for confounding,
with the application of the same doubly robust technique
outside the inﬂuenza season (i.e., without inﬂuenza activity
and independently of the vaccine effect), we would estimate

Statistical analysis was performed by using SAS, version
9.1, software (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina).
We used multiple (i.e., 5) imputations (Proc MI and Proc
MIANALYZE) to handle missing values (21, 22).
The study protocol was submitted to and approved by
the ethics committees of the participating local health
authorities.
RESULTS

A total of 107,661 people fulﬁlled the study eligibility
criteria. The unit of our analysis was person-season, or
equivalently, the number of vaccinations provided. One
person could contribute up to 3 separate inﬂuenza seasons
of risk for inﬂuenza-related outcomes, each of the 3 having
either vaccine assignment. Of the total of 107,661 participants, 43,667 were included for more than 1 year; of these,
23,484 received at least one vaccination of either type.
Overall, 88,449 ATIV and 82,539 TIV were administered
for a total of 170,988 person-seasons; after the data trimming based on the person-season distribution, we included
a total of 164,254 person-seasons in the primary analysis.
As expected, given the observational nature of the study
and the regional recommendations on the preferential use
of adjuvanted inﬂuenza vaccines in high-risk patients, the 2
vaccine groups showed some imbalance at baseline with
respect to age, functional limitations, and prevalence of
chronic conditions, with the recipients of ATIV showing
more functional impairment and comorbidities compared
with the recipients of TIV (Table 1).
Figure 1 shows the inﬂuenza incidence in Lombardy by
week during the 3 study years. Seasons 2006–2007 and
2008–2009 were mainly A/H3N2 epidemics, whereas

season 2007–2008 showed mainly circulation of A/H1N1
and B viruses. There were a total mismatch for the A/
H1N1-like strain and a partial mismatch for the A/H3N2like strain in the 2007–2008 season, as well as a partial
mismatch for B strains for all 3 years. Given the strains circulating, the mismatches which occurred in 2007–2008
were the only ones that could have affected the vaccine
effectiveness appreciably.
The primary analysis used the narrowest deﬁnition of the
time window for inﬂuenza-related events, which should
have the greatest speciﬁcity for the outcomes of interest,
corresponding to calendar weeks 4–7 inclusive in
2006–2007 and weeks 52–54 and 1–7 for the subsequent 2
inﬂuenza seasons. During these periods, there were 114
hospitalizations for inﬂuenza and pneumonia among the
84,665 person-seasons at risk for the ATIV group
(0.135%), compared with 111 among 79,589 for the TIV

group (0.139%). The crude risk ratio was 0.97 (95% conﬁdence interval (CI): 0.74, 1.25).
These crude comparisons are confounded by the various
factors that are unbalanced between the 2 vaccine groups
(refer to Table 2 for the distribution of cases and personseasons by age). We controlled for confounding by local
health authorities-provider and age using simultaneous
stratiﬁcation by these 2 variables, resulting in a MantelHaenszel risk ratio estimate of 0.87 (95% CI: 0.67, 1.13).
We then extended this stratiﬁcation to include sex, history
of lung-related hospitalization, level of functional impairment, and season; the corresponding Mantel-Haenszel
summary risk ratio was 0.80 (95% CI: 0.61, 1.06). These
analyses indicated that there was substantial confounding in
the crude data, but with control of the main confounders,
the adjuvanted vaccine group seemed to have about a 20%
lower risk of hospitalizations for inﬂuenza and pneumonia.
We then used the propensity score as a summary confounder in a multivariate logistic model based on the
trimmed data, which included the strongest confounders
along with the propensity score. From this model, we estimated a risk ratio of 0.75 (95% CI: 0.57, 0.98) for ATIV
relative to TIV, an association slightly stronger but very
close to the results of the stratiﬁed analyses (Table 3).
We repeated the above analyses using the intermediate
and broader time windows. These analyses have a less speciﬁc outcome than the analysis using the narrow time
window for inﬂuenza-related hospitalizations, as they
include a relatively greater proportion of background hospitalizations as the inﬂuenza epidemic began or waned. Thus,
one would expect that there would be more cases, but that
the associations found would be biased. As expected, the
number of cases increased from 225 for the analysis using
the narrow time window to 374 for the intermediate and
735 for the broadest time window; the risk ratio estimates
were 0.75 for the narrow time window, 0.83 for the intermediate window, and 0.88 for the broadest window
(Table 4), thus suggesting that misclassiﬁcation of outcome
in our study leads to a reduction of the estimated effect. In
the validation of hospital records in a subset of cases, we
conﬁrmed in 99.4% of the sample the concordance
between diagnoses recorded in the medical charts and the
diagnosis code in the database.
Moreover, the risk of hospitalization in the ATIV group
before each inﬂuenza season (May–September)—after propensity score estimation, trimming, and adjustment for confounding in a doubly robust multivariate model—was 17%
higher than that in the TIV control group (risk ratio = 1.17,
95% CI: 0.96, 1.43).
DISCUSSION

This is the ﬁrst large-scale study of the comparative
effectiveness of ATIV versus TIV. The study population of
107,661, contributing 170,988 person-seasons of observation, is considerably larger than could have been readily
enrolled into a randomized clinical trial.
We were able to link study participants to available administrative data, combining both self-reported information
through questionnaire and vaccine status at the time of

prescriptions, and other outcomes from administrative databases (extended to several years prior to enrollment). By
conducting the study over 3 years, we reduced the effect of
year-to-year variation in the antigenic “match” between the
vaccine and circulating inﬂuenza strains, a problem that
hampers the interpretation of ﬁndings in any study based
on only one inﬂuenza season.
The estimated 25% reduction in the risk of an inﬂuenzaor pneumonia-related hospitalization is an underestimate.

of inﬂuenza infection among our cases, even the most stringent time window that we used, and from which this

estimate comes, is susceptible to imperfect identiﬁcation of
relevant cases. We are not able to determine whether the
resulting misclassiﬁcation of outcome is differential or nondifferential, since in our study subjects receiving ATIV
were more frail and therefore may have had more baseline
hospitalizations. Our risk ratio estimate is in any case
closer to the null that it would be if the identiﬁcation of
inﬂuenza-related hospitalizations were perfect.
Methodological research has shown that, although controlling confounding by propensity scores performs only
about as well as more traditional methods (23), calculating
propensity scores does provide the ability to identify and
exclude outliers from the 2 study groups who have propensity scores outside the range, or the central distribution, of
the other group. This “trimming” improves the validity of
any analysis by restricting the study to comparable observations. In this study, we used trimming by propensity score
as an initial step, followed by 2 methods to control confounding, stratiﬁcation on the individual covariates and
doubly robust multivariate modeling.
We found that more stringent control of confounding
resulted in a stronger association in the direction of lower
risk of hospitalization among ATIV recipients, which was
expected given the observed imbalance in relevant covariates between the 2 vaccine cohorts.
Such imbalance also explains the 17% higher risk of
hospitalization in the ATIV group before each inﬂuenza
season, in a time when we would have expected the adjusted risk of hospitalization to be the same in the 2 groups.
The combined evidence that more frail people have been
enrolled in the ATIV cohort compared with the TIV cohort
and that our analysis has not removed all the confounding
leads to the conclusion that we have likely underestimated
the effectiveness of ATIV.
Some observational studies of inﬂuenza vaccine efﬁcacy
in preventing deaths have been encumbered by selection
bias, raising controversies about the validity of the observational approach in assessing inﬂuenza vaccine effectiveness
(24–31). In these studies, bias most likely reﬂects a
“healthy-vaccinee” effect, in which those who are at high
risk of a near-term death are less likely to be vaccinated.

Such confounding bias should not be a problem in this
study, which considered hospitalization for inﬂuenza or
pneumonia instead of all-cause mortality and involved a
head-to-head comparison of 2 inﬂuenza vaccines.
In conclusion, we found that vaccination with ATIV
reduced the risk of hospitalization for inﬂuenza or pneumonia in the elderly during the peak of the inﬂuenza season
by 25% relative to vaccination with TIV. Residual bias indicates that this value is likely to be an underestimate. The
routine use of ATIV in the elderly would provide important
