Abstract
Background: Simultaneously adhering to multiple healthy lifestyle factors has been related
to up to 90% reduction in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) incidence in White populations; however,
little is known about whether such protective effects persist in other non-White populations.
Methods: We examined the associations of six lifestyle factors with T2DM in the China
Kadoorie Biobank of 461 211 participants aged 30–79 years without diabetes, cardiovascular diseases or cancer at baseline. We defined low-risk lifestyle factors as nonsmoking or having stopped for reasons other than illness; alcohol consumption of
<30 g/day; upper quarter of the physical activity level; diet rich in vegetables and
fruits, low in red meat and with some degree of replacement of rice with wheat;
body mass index (BMI) of 18.5–23.9 kg/m2; and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) <0.90 (men)/
<0.85 (women).
Results: During a median of 7.2 years of follow-up, we identified 8784 incident T2DM. In
multivariable-adjusted analyses, two important risk factors for developing T2DM were
higher BMI and WHR. Compared with participants without any low-risk factors, the hazard ratio [95% confidence interval (CI)] for those with at least three low-risk factors was

0.20 (0.19, 0.22). Approximately 72.6% (64.2%, 79.3%) of the incident diabetes were attributable to the combination of BMI, WHR, diet and physical activity. The population attributable risk percentage (PAR%) of diabetes appeared to be similar for men and women,
and higher among urban, older and obese participants.
Conclusions: Our findings indicate that adherence to a healthy lifestyle may substantially
lower the burden of T2DM in the Chinese population.

Key Messages
• In mostly White populations from the USA, simultaneously adhering to multiple healthy lifestyle factors has been

related to up to 90% reduction in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) incidence. However, whether such protective effects persist
in other non-White populations remains unknown.
• In this prospective cohort study of Chinese adults, approximately three-quarters of incident T2DM over a period of

fewer than 10 years could have been avoided by adherence to a healthy lifestyle. The protective effects of adherence
to a healthy lifestyle were persistent in populations of different characteristics.
• Adherence to a healthy lifestyle could prevent the majority of cases of T2DM, including in less developed regions.

Background
Since 1980, the diabetes burden has shown a faster increase in low- and middle-income countries than in highincome countries.1 China is heading towards a diabetes
epidemic, with the prevalence rising from 2.5% in 19942
to 11.6% in 2010.3 Such soaring of diabetes prevalence
has paralleled a dramatic shift in dietary behaviour and
lifestyle from traditional, healthy patterns towards unhealthy patterns.
A series of landmark randomized clinical trials in highrisk individuals with impaired glucose tolerance have demonstrated that type 2 diabetes (T2DM) could be largely
prevented through dietary and lifestyle modifications,4
which have shown at least similar effectiveness as drug
treatment5 and exhibited sustaining effects for many years
after the intervention period.4 Because long-term pharmacologic intervention is costly, only applicable to a specific
high-risk population and may lead to side effects, adherence to a healthy lifestyle remains a mainstream approach
for the prevention of diabetes.6,7
Several modifiable, healthy lifestyle factors consistently
linked to a lower risk of T2DM include lower weight,8
healthy dietary patterns,9 being physically active,10 nonsmoking11 and moderate alcohol consumption.12 In mostly
White populations from the USA, simultaneously adhering
to these healthy lifestyle factors has been related to up to
roughly 90% reduction in T2DM incidence.13–15 Only a
few prospective studies in the Chinese population have
associated healthy lifestyle factors with a lower risk of

incident diabetes.16 However, how much of the burden of
T2DM that could be prevented through adherence to a
combination of healthy lifestyle factors remains unknown
in the Chinese population.
In the current study, we prospectively examined the
joint association of several modifiable dietary and lifestyle
factors with the risk of T2DM and estimated the proportion of the disease that could potentially be prevented by
the adoption of a healthy lifestyle in a large cohort of 0.5
million adult Chinese—the China Kadoorie Biobank
(CKB).17,18

Methods
Study population
The CKB cohort was established during 2004–08, when
512 891 adults aged 30–79 years were enrolled from 10
study areas geographically spread across China, with valid
baseline data including completed questionnaire, physical
measurements and a written informed consent form. The
study areas included five urban areas (Harbin, Qingdao,
Suzhou, Liuzhou and Haikou) and five rural areas (Gansu,
Henan, Sichuan, Zhejiang and Hunan). The Ethical
Review Committee of the Chinese Center for Disease
Control and Prevention (Beijing, China) and the Oxford
Tropical Research Ethics Committee, University of Oxford
(UK) approved the study. Further details of the CKB cohort have been described in previous publication.17,18

For the present analysis, we excluded participants
(n ¼ 30 300) who had a self-reported history of diabetes or
screen-detected diabetes, defined as measured fasting blood
glucose 7.0 mmol/L or random blood glucose
11.1 mmol/L at baseline. We also excluded participants
with previously diagnosed heart disease (n ¼ 15 472),
stroke (n ¼ 8884) or cancer (n ¼ 2577), and those who had
missing data for body mass index (BMI, n ¼ 2) or were lost
to follow-up shortly after baseline (n ¼ 3). After these exclusions, the analysis included 461 211 participants.

Assessment of lifestyle factors and other
covariates
We assessed a range of lifestyle factors in the baseline questionnaire. We asked the frequency, type and amount of tobacco smoked per day for ever smokers, and years since
quitting and the reason for quitting for former smokers.
Questions about alcohol consumption included typical
drinking frequency, type of alcoholic beverage drunk habitually and volume of alcohol drunk on a typical drinking
day in the past 12 months. Physical activity was assessed
by asking the usual type and duration of activities in occupational, commuting, domestic and leisure-time-related
domains in the past 12 months. We multiplied the metabolic equivalent tasks (METs) value for a particular type of
activity by hours spent on that activity per day and
summed the MET-hours for all activities to get the daily
level of physical activity. We assessed habitual intakes of
12 conventional food groups in the past 12 months using a
short qualitative food frequency questionnaire. The reproducibility of the assessment has been validated in previous
studies.19–21
Trained staff measured weight, height and circumferences of waist and hip using calibrated instruments. We
calculated BMI as weight in kilograms divided by height in
metres squared. Waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) was the ratio of
waist circumference to hip circumference.
The baseline questionnaire also inquired about the
socio-demographic characteristics, personal and family
medical history, and women’s reproductive information. A
participant was considered as having a family history of
diabetes if he reported at least one first-degree relative with
that disease.

Definition of low-risk lifestyle
We considered six dietary and lifestyle factors to define a
low-risk lifestyle, namely smoking, alcohol consumption,
physical activity, diet, BMI and WHR, consistently with
previous studies.13–15 These factors have also been addressed in recent guidelines22,23 for the prevention of

International Journal of Epidemiology, 2017, Vol. 46, No. 5

T2DM and associated with the increase of diabetes in
China.24 We defined participants who reported not smoking or having stopped for reasons other than illness as
being at low risk for smoking status. In the CKB cohort,
about half of former smokers quit because of illness.25 We
included former smokers who stopped smoking for illness
in the current smoker category to avoid misleadingly elevated risk. The low-risk group for alcohol consumption
was defined as those who drank greater than zero but less
than 30 g of alcohol per day. Participants who engaged in a
sex-specific upper quarter of the physical activity level
were defined as being at low risk for physical activity.
For dietary factors, we considered four food items
including vegetables, fruits, red meat and wheat. High consumption of white rice has been associated with an
increased risk of T2DM.26 Because the daily frequency and
amount of rice consumed were not collected, we used the
weekly frequency of wheat consumption as a surrogate
measure. For example, if participants reported eating
wheat every day, it indicates that they had partial or complete replacement for white rice with wheat. Specifically,
in the present study, we defined participants who reported
eating vegetables, fruits and wheat every day and red meat
less than daily as being at low risk for the dietary pattern.
For general adiposity measured by BMI, the low-risk
group was defined as those who had a BMI of 18.5–
23.9 kg/m2, according to the standard classification specific for the Chinese population.27 For central adiposity
measured by WHR, the low-risk group was defined as
those who had a WHR < 0.90 in men and <0.85 in
women.

Ascertainment of T2DM
We identified incident diabetes since the participants’ enrollment into the study at baseline using linkage with local
disease and death registries, with the recently established
national health insurance system and by active followup.17 Trained staff, blinded to the baseline information,
coded all cases with the 10th revision of the International
Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). For the present analysis, we included diabetes cases coded as E11 and E14.
Other cases clearly defined as non-T2DM were excluded.
Because the vast majority of our participants were aged
over 40 years among whom the number of any non-T2DM
was small, misclassification of other types of diabetes was
minimal. The validity of reported diabetes diagnosis has
been adjudicated in a random sample of 831 cases by clinical research fellows in the Oxford International
Coordinating Center of the CKB reviewing their medical
records during 2012–13, of which 98.6% were
reconfirmed.

International Journal of Epidemiology, 2017, Vol. 46, No. 5

Statistical analysis
We calculated person-years at risk from the baseline date
to the diagnosis of diabetes, death, loss to follow-up or 31
December 2013, whichever came first. Loss to follow-up
in the CKB study referred to a participant whose permanent registered residence had moved out of the jurisdiction
of the Regional Coordinating Center. By 31 December
2013, 2411 (0.5%) participants were lost to follow-up.
Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the
hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI), with
age as the underlying time scale, and stratified jointly by
study area and age at baseline in a 5-year interval.
Multivariable models were adjusted for age, sex, education, marital status, family history of diabetes, menopausal
status (for women only) and, in analyses of the individual
lifestyle factors, each of the other lifestyle factors. The linear trend test for individual factors was performed by assigning the sex-specific median to each category and then
modelling this as a continuous variable in a separate
model, and, for combined lifestyle factors, by treating the
number of low-risk factors as a continuous variable. The
test for interaction was performed by using likelihood ratio
test comparing models with and without cross-product
term.
We calculated the population attributable risk percentage (PAR%)28,29—an estimate of the percentage of incident diabetes in this population during follow-up that
hypothetically would not have occurred if all participants
had been in the low-risk group, assuming a causal relation.
In these analyses, we used a single binary variable and
compared participants in the low-risk group for each factor with all the others, following a method previously suggested by Wacholder et al.30 We conducted analyses
stratified according to the sex, residence, age, family history of diabetes and adiposity. We also repeated the analysis among never-regular smokers and never-regular
drinkers.
We calculated PAR% using SAS (version 9.4, SAS
Institute Inc.). All other statistical analyses were performed
using Stata (version 13.1, StataCorp).

Results
Of 461 211 participants, 0.3%, 7.2% and 31.4% had at
least five, four and three low-risk lifestyle factors, respectively. Participants of women, younger age, being more educated and urban residents were more likely to adhere to a
healthy lifestyle (Table 1).
During a median of 7.2 years (3 291 895 person-years)
of follow-up, we identified 8784 incident T2DM. After
mutual adjustment for all lifestyle factors and other

1413

covariates, two important risk factors for developing
T2DM were higher BMI and WHR (Table 2; and
Supplementary Table 1, available as Supplementary Data
at IJE online). Heavy smoking was associated with an
increased risk of diabetes, whereas light-to-moderate alcohol consumption, high physical activity and a diet rich in
vegetables and fruits, low in red meat and with part or
complete replacement of rice with wheat every day were
associated with a reduced risk of diabetes, even after adjustment for the BMI and WHR. The inverse association
between physical activity and diabetes was slightly attenuated after including BMI and WHR in the model.
When we dichotomized the six lifestyle factors, all lowrisk factors except non-smoking were independently associated with a lower risk of diabetes in the whole cohort
(Table 3). In this population, 34.4% (95% CI: 31.9%,
36.8%) of the incident diabetes could be attributed to
higher or lower than normal BMI and 39.8% (37.4%,
42.3%) could be attributed to higher WHR. We repeated
the analysis using BMI < 24.0 kg/m2 as the low-risk definition; the PAR% (95% CI) was 36.0% (33.5%, 38.4%)
for overweight/obesity and 34.7% (31.8%, 37.5%) for
higher WHR. After adjustment for BMI and WHR, the
PAR% (95% CI) for an unhealthy diet and lack of physical
activity was 26.5 (15.3, 36.9) and 9.1 (5.2, 13.1), respectively. Subgroup analyses according to baseline factors
showed that the PAR% for low physical activity was
slightly higher in the urban population, and the PAR% for
the unhealthy diet was higher in the urban and older populations
(Supplementary
Table
2,
available
as
Supplementary Data at IJE online).
When these lifestyle factors were considered jointly, the
risk of developing diabetes decreased significantly with an
increasing number of the low-risk factors in both men and
women (all P for linear trend < 0.001) (Figure 1 and
Supplementary Table 3, available as Supplementary Data
at IJE online). Compared with participants who were not
in the low-risk group for any factors, a combination of
three or more healthy lifestyle factors was associated with
an 80% reduction in the risk of diabetes. The respective
adjusted HR (95% CI) was 0.20 (0.19, 0.22), 0.23 (0.20,
0.26) and 0.22 (0.18, 0.27) for the whole cohort, men and
women.
To assess the robustness of the findings, we examined
potential confounding of socio-economic status by adding
occupation and household income to the model. To minimize potential bias due to subclinical conditions, we performed sensitivity analyses by further excluding diabetes
cases that occurred in the first 2 years of follow-up and the
results did not materially change (data not shown).
The combined PAR% (95% CI) of diabetes in relation
to the lack of physical activity and unhealthy diet was

BMI, body mass index; WHR, waist-to-hip ratio. The results are presented as adjusted means or percentages, with adjustment for age and study area, as appropriate. All baseline characteristics were associated with the number of low-risk lifestyle factors, with P < 0.001 for trend across categories, except for eating wheat
daily in men (P ¼ 0.001) and post-menopausal status in women (P ¼ 0.057).
a
Low-risk lifestyle factors were defined as: non-smoking or having stopped for reasons other than illness; drinking greater than zero but less than 30 g of alcohol
per day; engaging in a sex-specific upper quarter of the physical activity level; eating vegetables, fruits and wheat every day and red meat less than daily; having a
BMI between 18.5 and 23.9 kg/m2; and having a WHR < 0.90 in men and <0.85 in women.
b
The numbers in parentheses indicate the proportion of participants who had a different number of low-risk lifestyle factors.

36.2% (19.9%, 50.5%) without adjustment for BMI and
WHR in the model, and reduced slightly to 33.2%
(16.3%, 48.2%) after adjustment for BMI and WHR
(Table 4). When we included BMI and WHR in the definition of low-risk lifestyle, the PAR% (95% CI) increased to
72.6% (64.2%, 79.3%), suggesting that approximately
three-quarters of the incident diabetes might have been
prevented if all participants had been in the low-risk group

for these four factors. The addition of non-smoking and
light-to-moderate alcohol consumption to the low-risk definition added little to the PAR% (78.8%; 95% CI: 67.9%,
86.3%). We also calculated PAR% of different orders in
which six low-risk lifestyle factors were added to the cumulative model in Table 4. Non-smoking had no contribution to the PAR% regardless of when it was added to the
model (data not shown). Light-to-moderate alcohol

consumption added more to the PAR% if it was put at the
beginning of the order. For example, when we included
non-smoking and light-to-moderate alcohol consumption
first, the PAR% (95% CI) was 22.5% (7.8%, 36.2%).
The PAR% estimates in relation to physical activity,
diet, BMI and WHR in combination seems similar for men
and women, and for participants with or without a family
history of diabetes. The potential reduction in the incident
diabetes among never-regular smokers and never-regular

drinkers were consistent with those observed in the whole
cohort. The PAR% appeared higher among urban residents, older populations and obese participants.

a
Low-risk lifestyle factors were defined as: non-smoking or having stopped for reasons other than illness; drinking greater than zero but less than 30 g of alcohol
per day; engaging in a sex-specific upper quarter of the physical activity level; eating vegetables, fruits and wheat every day and red meat less than daily; having a
BMI between 18.5 and 23.9 kg/m2; and having a WHR < 0.90 in men and <0.85 in women.
b
Multivariable model was adjusted for age, sex (for whole cohort only), education, marital status, family history of diabetes, menopausal status (for women
only), and follow-up period and study area (only in pooled logistic regression model). Lifestyle factors including smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity
and dietary pattern were included simultaneously in the same model.
c
All associations of low-risk lifestyle factors with the risk of incident diabetes were consistently observed in both men and women, with P > 0.05 for interaction
with sex, except for smoking (P ¼ 0.023 for interaction).

diet rich in vegetables and fruits and low in red meat and
white rice, being physically active, abstaining from smoking and consuming alcohol in moderation were associated
with a significantly reduced risk of T2DM. Participants at
low risk for three or more lifestyle factors had an 80%
lower risk of diabetes than those without any of the lowrisk factors. If observed associations were causal, approximately three-quarters of incident T2DM in this population
during a median 7.2 years of follow-up could have been
avoided by adherence to a healthy lifestyle.
Previous diabetes-prevention trials have shown that lifestyle interventions could reduce the risk of T2DM in highrisk populations.5 Our findings, consistent with previous
prospective cohort studies conducted in mostly White
populations from the USA13–15 and Europe,31 provided robust evidence for the beneficial effects of adherence to a
healthy lifestyle on the reduction of diabetes risk in the
Chinese population. Findings from the Nurses’ Health

Study (NHS) of 16 years of follow-up showed that 91%
(95% CI: 83%, 95%) of diabetes cases in these middleaged women of high socio-economic status could be attributed to overweight, a poor diet, lack of exercise, smoking
and abstinence from alcohol.13 A similar PAR% of 89%
(23%, 99%) was reported in an older US population aged
65 years and older.14 In another study conducted in a
pooled sample of two Finnish cohorts aged 40–79 years,
five modifiable lifestyle factors defined by BMI, exercise,
smoking, alcohol consumption and serum vitamin D explained 82% (70%, 90%) of the diabetes cases during a
10-year period.31 The Multiethnic Cohort study with
12-year follow-up showed that the PAR% (95% CI) for
overweight, physical inactivity, high meat intake, no alcohol consumption and smoking was greatest among
Caucasians [86% (64%, 95%) for men and 90% (66%,
97%) for women], followed by Native Hawaiians, and
lowest among Japanese Americans [70% (44%, 85%) for

men and 73% (42%, 88%) for women].15 Even after lowering the BMI cut-off from 25 kg/m2 to 23 kg/m2, the gap
between Japanese Americans [77% (55%, 89%) for men
and 78% (51%, 91%) for women] and Caucasians
persisted.
The PAR% for the combination of BMI, WHR, diet,
physical activity, smoking and alcohol consumption in our
Chinese population was close to that of the Japanese
Americans in the Multiethnic Cohort15 and appeared to be
lower than that of the White populations.13–15 A possible
explanation for this difference is that major lifestyle factors
included in the present study were mirrored from the
White populations. Other Asian-specific lifestyle risk factors might exist.24
PAR% is a population-specific calculation that depends
on both the prevalence of risk factor and its association
with disease risk. In the present study, the difference in the
prevalence of several lifestyle factors across subgroups
might lead to the observed subgroup variations in the
PAR% for individual low-risk factors. For example, the
PAR% for unhealthy diet differed between urban and rural

1417

residence. However, the overall proportion of disease that
was attributable to the combination of these lifestyle factors differed less than might have been expected. Our findings suggested that adopting a healthy lifestyle could
significantly reduce the risk of diabetes in people with family history of diabetes, similarly to the general population.
In addition, our data showed that the protective effects of
adherence to healthy lifestyle were persistent regardless of
sex, age, urban or rural residence and adiposity status.
We found that obesity was among the most important
risk factors for T2DM in Chinese people, in agreement
with previous studies in White populations.13–15,31 It is
well recognized that the maintenance of healthy weight
confers the greatest benefits in T2DM prevention. Physical
activity and diet are critical for weight loss and maintenance. However, the present study found that, even after adjustment for adiposity measures, high physical activity and
a healthy diet were still associated with a reduced risk for
diabetes, similarly to findings reported in previous cohort
studies in the general population13–15 and prevention trials
in high-risk individuals.4 This observation suggested that
the beneficial effects of increased physical activity and dietary modifications were at least through mechanisms beyond weight loss.
It is worth mentioning that the PAR% results of different orders in which six low-risk lifestyle factors were added
to the cumulative model were slightly different, as healthrelated behaviours usually influence each other in a clustered way. The choice of the order in the present study was
a public health consideration. Non-smoking was not associated with a lower risk of T2DM in the present population. Light-to-moderate alcohol consumption was shown
to have an important protective effect on diabetes.
However, even light-to-moderate drinking might increase
the risk of other outcomes such as cancer.32,33 We would
be cautious on the recommendation of consuming alcohol
regarding overall human health.34,35 Therefore, we
included these two factors in the model last.
To the best of our knowledge, this is by far the largest
prospective study quantifying the burden of T2DM that
could be prevented through adherence to a combination of
healthy dietary and lifestyle factors. Our study for the first
time provided evidence for the joint beneficial effects of
multiple lifestyle factors on prevention of diabetes in the
nationally representative general Chinese population. The
inclusion of a geographically spread population living in
urban and rural areas, with different socio-demographic
characteristics, makes our results broadly applicable. The
large sample size permitted subgroup analyses by several
characteristics. We have carefully controlled for potential
confounding factors and sought to minimize the reverse
causation bias by excluding participants with major

chronic diseases at baseline that might lead to lifestyle
changes. The anthropometric information was measured
rather than self-reported in our cohort, providing more accurate estimates of BMI and WHR.
Several limitations merit consideration. Measurement
errors in self-reported lifestyle factors are inevitable; however, misclassification in this prospective study should be
non-differential on subsequent disease status and tend to
underestimate the true relative risks. The lifestyle factors
were measured once at baseline and might not necessarily reflect the long-term exposure. Accordingly, the present study
possibly underestimates the importance of individual and
combined effects of lifestyle factors on diabetes risk. Lack of
comprehensive assessment of food consumption limited our
ability to capture the complexity of the dietary patterns.
Nevertheless, the limited food items instead of the complex
dietary score may simplify the public health interpretation of
our findings. Since the identification of incident diabetes in
this study depended mainly on the health insurance system,
some cases of asymptomatic diabetes might be undiagnosed.
Although the present study might underestimate the incidence of diabetes, such non-differential misclassification
might lead to attenuation of effect estimates.

Conclusions
In summary, the present study is thus far the largest prospective cohort of Chinese adults to provide critical quantitative estimates of the potential effects of modifying diet
and lifestyle on the fast-growing burden of T2DM in
China. Our findings suggest that the majority of cases of
T2DM could be prevented by adherence to a healthy lifestyle, i.e. maintaining lean body weight without central
adiposity, following healthy diet habits and being physically active. Our study lends robust support to lifestyle
intervention on the reduction of diabetes in the Chinese
population.
