ABSTRACT
The cases of human infections with H10N8 viruses identified in late 2013 and early 2014 in Jiangxi, China, have raised concerns
over the origin, prevalence, and development of these viruses in this region. Our long-term influenza surveillance of poultry and
migratory birds in southern China in the past 12 years showed that H10 influenza viruses have been introduced from migratory
to domestic ducks over several winter seasons at sentinel duck farms at Poyang Lake, where domestic ducks share their water
body with overwintering migratory birds. H10 viruses were never detected in terrestrial poultry in our survey areas until August
2013, when they were identified at live-poultry markets in Jiangxi. Since then, we have isolated 124 H10N8 or H10N6 viruses
from chickens at local markets, revealing an ongoing outbreak. Phylogenetic analysis of H10 and related viruses showed that the
chicken H10N8 viruses were generated through multiple reassortments between H10 and N8 viruses from domestic ducks and
the enzootic chicken H9N2 viruses. These chicken reassortant viruses were highly similar to the human isolate, indicating that
market chickens were the source of human infection. Recently, the H10 viruses further reassorted, apparently with H5N6 vi-
ruses, and generated an H10N6 variant. The emergence and prevalence of H10 viruses in chickens and the occurrence of human
infections provide direct evidence of the threat from the current influenza ecosystem in China.
IMPORTANCE
After the outbreak of avian-origin H7N9 influenza viruses in China, fatal human infections with a novel H10N8 virus were re-
ported. Utilizing data from 12 years of influenza surveillance in southern China, we showed that H10 viruses were regularly in-
troduced by migratory ducks to domestic ducks on Poyang Lake, a major aggregative site of migratory birds in Asia. The H10
viruses were maintained and amplified in domestic ducks and then transmitted to chickens and reassorted with enzootic H9N2
viruses, leading to an outbreak and human infections at live-poultry markets. The emergence of the H10N8 virus, following a
pathway similar to that of the recent H7N9 virus, highlights the role of domestic ducks and the current influenza ecosystem in
China that facilitates influenza viruses moving from their reservoir hosts through the live-poultry system to cause severe conse-
quences for public health.
Direct interspecies transmissions of avian influenza viruses
(AIVs) to humans repeatedly occurred in the last 2 decades,
especially in regions where AIVs have become established or en-
zootic in poultry (1–4). Lowly pathogenic AIVs do not usually
cause explicit symptoms in poultry, and unless ongoing surveil-
lance is in place, human infections may occur before an outbreak
in poultry is recognized, as was the case with the recent H7N9
viruses (5, 6).
It was through hospital-based surveillance of patients with se-
vere pneumonia in China that a novel H10N8 AIV was identified
in Nanchang, Jiangxi, with three cases occurring between Novem-
ber 2013 and February 2014 (7, 8). The virus isolated from the
initial patient was a reassortant, with its internal gene complex
derived from the H9N2 viruses enzootic in chickens in China and
its surface genes related to those found in ducks and wild birds (7,
9). This is similar to the H7N9 viruses that emerged in early 2013
(5, 6). The patients with H10N8 infections were known to have a
history of visiting live-poultry markets (LPMs) or exposure to live
poultry before disease onset (7, 8), suggesting that market chick-
ens may be the source of human infections (9, 10).
H10 subtype influenza viruses from waterfowl have occasion-
ally infected mammals. H10N7 viruses were found to cause spo-
radic human infection cases in Egypt in 2004 (11) and in Australia
in 2010 (12). An H10N4 outbreak in mink was observed in 1984
(13), and an H10N5 virus was detected in swine in 2008 (14). All of
these were short-term and isolated events. H10 viruses have never

become established and caused continuous infections in mamma-
lian species.
Continuing human infections with H7N9 AIVs (5, 6) and the
enzootic status of H5N1 (15) and H9N2 (16) AIVs indicate that
the influenza ecosystem in China can facilitate the emergence and
persistence of influenza viruses that are able to infect humans.
Whether the H10N8 viruses infecting humans will persist remains
to be explored. The findings of our systematic surveillance in six
provinces of southern China from 2002 to 2014 showed that H10
viruses were regularly found in wild and domestic ducks but were
never identified in terrestrial poultry until August 2013. Since
then, and prior to the appearance of human infections, H10N8
viruses were frequently isolated from chickens at LPMs in Nan-
chang.
How H10 viruses evolved in wild and domestic birds over the
past decades, how the current influenza ecosystem in China led to
the genesis of the H10N8 virus infecting humans, and how these
H10 viruses are continuing to develop remain to be fully ad-
dressed. To examine these questions and the potential conse-
quences of the emergence of H10 viruses in Nanchang, detailed
analyses of the genomic sequences of 219 H10 and 124 related
viruses isolated in our surveillance network during the last 12
years were undertaken. The H10N8 virus that infected a human
resulted from the interaction of wild birds with domestic ducks in
the farming system of China, leading to the transfer of H10 and N8
genes to the markets and reassortment with enzootic H9N2 vi-
ruses. The transfer of the chicken viruses to humans was coinci-
dent with H10 virus outbreaks in LPMs. The continuing presence
of the H10 virus in markets led to it acquiring an N6 neuramini-
dase (NA), again demonstrating the role of LPMs and the current
influenza ecosystem of China in generating and perpetuating in-
fluenza viruses that pose threats to public health.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Active surveillance in southern China.Ongoing surveillance of influenza
viruses in Jiangxi province has been conducted since 2002 at live-poultry
markets (LPMs) in the capital city Nanchang (primarily from either the
major wholesale or retail market), two sentinel duck farms (farms raising
only domestic ducks, which share their water body with migratory water-
fowl), and uninhabited islets in Poyang Lake, a major overwinter aggre-
gation site for migratory waterfowl in Asia (Table 1). Simultaneous sam-
pling in islets and sentinel duck farms at Poyang Lake can be used to
monitor the transmission of viruses between migratory waterfowl and
domestic ducks.
Migratory bird samples were obtained from fresh fecal droppings col-
lected at isolated, publicly accessible islets on the lake from mid-October
to the next March without disturbing the birds. Cloacal samples were
taken year-round from sentinel ducks, approximately every 10 days. Sam-
pling at LPMs in Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Jiangxi, and
Yunnan was carried out weekly from 2002 to 2014. Paired oropharyngeal
and cloacal swabs were taken from apparently healthy birds at the mar-
kets. Surveillance in farms and markets was conducted according to pro-
cedures and guidelines in the WHO Manual on Animal Influenza Diagno-
sis and Surveillance (17).
Sample swabs were collected in vials with transport medium (medium
199 with antibiotics) and kept in cool boxes before being sent to the
laboratory, where they were inoculated in 9- to 11-day-old embryonated
chicken eggs for 48 to 72 h at 36°C to isolate influenza viruses (5). Hem-
agglutinin (HA)-positive isolates were further subtyped by hemagglutinin
inhibition and neuraminidase inhibition assays using a panel of reference
antisera, as described previously (5).
Full-genome sequencing. Samples were selected for sequencing as
described below. Sequencing was performed by using a Roche 454 Ge-
nome Sequencer Junior with sample preparation according to the manu-
facturer’s protocols, giving ⬃150⫻ coverage of the influenza virus ge-
nome on average. Original reads from 454 sequencing were assembled
into contigs by using overlapping regions of 40 nucleotides with ⬎90%
identity with the 454 de novo assembler. Contigs were identified as influ-
enza A virus sequences by using BLAST against the influenza A virus
sequences from GenBank. The contigs were then assembled with Laser-
gene, version 9.0 (DNAStar). For samples having mixed infections, based
on manual curation, if two copies of an internal gene segment had ⬍97%
identity in the nucleotide sequence, they were separated and named mix-a
and mix-b. Otherwise, the gene was marked as “mixed” with degenerate
nucleotide codes and excluded from further analysis.

Data set preparation and alignment. Nucleotide sequences generated
in this study were combined with all publicly available sequences of avian
influenza A viruses in GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/GenBank)
and H10N8 and H7N9 human virus sequences from GISAID (http:
//gisaid.org/). Sequences with ⬎5 ambiguous nucleotides, or ⬍70% of the
length of the coding region, or that were mosaic (18) were excluded.
Sequences were aligned by using MUSCLE v3.5 (19), with manual adjust-
ments.
Phylogenetic analysis. A “panoramic” maximum likelihood (ML)
phylogeny of each gene segment was first constructed by using the rapid
hill-climbing search method and the GTRGAMMA nucleotide substitu-
tion model in RAxML v7.6.8 (20). The Eurasian lineage that contains the
H10N8 human and chicken isolates was retained, except for the N8 gene,
where the major North American lineage was kept. The number of se-
quences of each segment was reduced to ⬃1,000 by keeping those se-
quences most closely related to the H10N8 viruses. They were then built
into ML phylogenies by 100 independent tree searches using RAxML
v7.6.8. The robustness of the topologies was evaluated with the Shimod-
aira-Hasegawa approximate likelihood ratio test (21) on the best trees.
The smaller ML trees shown in Fig. 2 and 3 were created with PhyML v3.0
(22), with bootstrap support values obtained from 1,000 pseudorepli-
cates.
Molecular dating. A set of closely related viruses (⬃100 sequences for
each gene) was chosen for molecular clock estimation. The time-scaled
maximum clade credibility phylogenies of the H10 virus segments were
inferred by using a relaxed molecular clock model with an uncorrelated
log-normal distribution (23) and virus sampling dates accurate to the day
of a year. The SRD06 nucleotide substitution model (24) and the coales-
cent Bayesian skyline model (25) were incorporated into the Bayesian
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method implemented in BEAST
v1.7.5 (26). Multiple independent MCMC runs were performed and as-
sessed for consistency. They were combined to give a total chain length of
2 ⫻ 108
to 6 ⫻ 108
steps, with sampling at every 1,000 steps. Convergence
of relevant parameters was assessed by effective sample sizes of ⬎200 in
Tracer v1.5 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/).
Nucleotide sequence accession numbers. Sequences generated in this
study are available in GenBank under accession numbers KP284874 to
KP288026.
RESULTS
Prevalence of H10 AIV in aquatic birds. From 2002 to 2014, a
total of 560 H10 AIVs were isolated from migratory or domestic
ducks in six provinces in southern China. Of these, 539 were iso-
lated in Jiangxi from migratory ducks (n ⫽ 27) at islets in Poyang
Lake, sentinel domestic ducks (n ⫽ 407) at farms on Poyang Lake,
and domestic ducks (n ⫽ 105) at LPMs in Nanchang (40 km
southwest of Poyang Lake) (Table 1). In contrast, in the remaining
five provinces, only 21 H10 viruses were isolated from domestic
ducks, and 3 were isolated from geese. Transmissions of H10 vi-
ruses from migratory birds to sentinel domestic ducks in Jiangxi
were observed in the winters of 2005 to 2006, 2008 to 2009, and
2012 to 2013, with further transmissions to domestic ducks at
LPMs (Table 1). Thus, Poyang Lake, a major aggregative site of
migratory birds in Asia, is a major source of H10 viruses in south-
ern China, while sentinel domestic ducks played a key role in
spreading the H10 viruses.
Emergence and outbreak of H10 AIV in chickens in Jiangxi.
The H10 subtype had never been detected in terrestrial poultry
before August 2013 in our surveillance areas. Up to April 2014, a
total of 124 H10 viruses were isolated from chickens at LPMs in
Nanchang (Table 1 and Fig. 1). Sixty-seven H10N8 viruses were
obtained over 13 sampling occasions from August 2013 to January
2014, and 57 H10N6 viruses were isolated on 4 sampling occasions
in March and April 2014 (Fig. 1). All chicken H10 viruses were
detected from oropharyngeal swabs, suggesting that these chicken
H10 viruses mainly replicated in and were shed through the upper
respiratory and/or oral tract. Nearly one-half (n ⫽ 33) of the
chicken H10N8 isolates were detected as mixed infections with
H9N2 viruses. Of the H10N6 isolates, six were detected as mixed
infections with H7N9 viruses, and one was mixed with an H9N2
virus.

obtained. These were H10 chicken isolates, 23 migratory duck
isolates, 33 sentinel duck isolates, and 39 viruses from domestic
ducks at LPMs (Table 1). Additionally, 68 H9N2 viruses and 56 N8
or N6 viruses isolated from 2013 to 2014 were also sequenced. All
the sequences were analyzed along with those of the human
H10N8 virus (A/Jiangxi/Donghu-346/2013 [JX346]) and other
closely related sequences from publicly available databases.
Phylogenetic analysis of the H10 HA gene showed that there
was a recent introduction of H10 viruses from migratory ducks to
domestic ducks in Jiangxi from 2012 to 2013 and three earlier
introductions in 2003, early 2005, and 2008 (Fig. 2A, asterisks; see
also Fig. S1A in the supplemental material, asterisks). Only a single
introduction of an H10 virus from domestic ducks to chickens was
observed. The HA genes of all the chicken H10N8 viruses isolated
at LPMs in Nanchang formed a monophyletic group (the JX346-
like sublineage) together with the human H10N8 isolate, consis-
tent with avian-to-human transmission of the virus at the LPM
(Fig. 2A). The chicken H10N6 viruses that were isolated subse-
quently also had HA genes belonging to this sublineage, suggest-
ing that N6 was acquired by a reassortment of the H10N8 viruses.
The N8 gene phylogeny showed that all the NA genes of the
chicken H10N8 viruses formed a monophyletic group (the JX346-
like sublineage), with ⬎99.5% nucleotide sequence identity to the
human isolate. N8 genes from Jiangxi domestic duck isolates with
mixed infections involving multiple subtypes were the immediate
outlier group of the chicken H10N8 viruses (Fig. 2B; see also Fig.
S1B in the supplemental material), suggesting that frequent coin-
fections and reassortment in ducks may contribute to the assem-
bly of novel HA and NA combinations and may be associated with
interspecies transmission to chickens. These viruses were derived
from the North American lineage as one of the several interconti-
nental transmissions of the N8 segment to the Eurasian gene pool
that subsequently passed from migratory birds in eastern Asia to
domestic ducks in Jiangxi (Fig. 2B, triangles; see also Fig. S1B in
the supplemental material, triangle).
The N8 genes of the duck H10N8 viruses isolated at sentinel
duck farms on Poyang Lake in February 2013 were genetically
distant from those of the human and chicken viruses and origi-
nated from a separate intercontinental introduction (Fig. 2B; see
also Fig. S1B in the supplemental material). Even though H3N8
viruses have been the most predominant among duck N8 viruses,
only one chicken H3 virus (H3N8, isolated in February 2013) was
identified in Jiangxi (Fig. 2B; see also Fig. S1B in the supplemental
material). This chicken N8 gene was more closely related to those
of the duck H10N8 viruses isolated at the sentinel duck farms than
to the N8 genes of the JX346-like sublineage that led to the human
infection.
The N6 genes of the chicken H10N6 viruses isolated from Ji-
angxi LPMs were closely related to those of H6N6 viruses estab-
lished in domestic ducks in southern China (27). They appear to
be directly derived from H5N6 viruses isolated from multiple
types of poultry from late 2013 to early 2014, which acquired the
N6 gene containing an 11-amino-acid stalk deletion from H6N6
viruses of ducks in southern China (Fig. 2C; see also Fig. S1C in the
supplemental material) (27). This indicates a recent reassortment,
probably between the H10N8 and H5N6 viruses in poultry. Only
H10N6 viruses have been detected in chickens at LPMs since
March 2014, suggesting that the N8 gene may have been replaced.
The internal genes of chicken H10N8 and H10N6 viruses were
derived mainly from the locally enzootic chicken H9N2 virus lin-
eage (Ck/Zhejiang/HJ/2007, ZJ-HJ-07 lineage) (Fig. 3; ZJ-HJ-07;
see also Fig. S2 in the supplemental material), as were the internal
genes of the human H10N8 and the recent H7N9 viruses. For each
internal gene, the majority of the H10N8 viruses, including that
from the human case, formed a monophyletic clade (JX346-like)
(Fig. 3; see also Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). PB1 and PB2
gene segments derived from Eurasian gene pool viruses were com-
monly identified in the H10N8 viruses, leading to four different
genotypes (Fig. 4; see also Tables S1 and S2 in the supplemental
material) before January 2014. These segments were then replaced
by those from H9N2 viruses (Fig. 3; see also Fig. S2A and S2B and
Tables S1 and S2 in the supplemental material), indicating con-
tinual reassortments between H10N8 and H9N2 viruses. In the
case of a few chicken H10 viruses, the internal genes clustered with
those from the first wave of H7N9 viruses (Fig. 3; see also Fig. S2 in
the supplemental material), suggesting that H10 viruses might
have reassorted in chickens with H7N9 viruses or with H9N2 vi-
ruses that carried H7N9-like internal genes.
Dating the emergence of the H10N8 viruses. The times of the
interspecies transmission and reassortment events leading to the
emergence of the chicken H10N8 viruses were estimated by mo-
lecular dating (see Fig. S3 and S4 in the supplemental material).
The H10 gene was transferred from ducks to chickens in April to
June 2013, based on estimates for the time of divergence (tDiv)
from the duck lineages to the time of the most recent common
ancestor (tMRCA) of the chicken viruses. Similarly, the transfer of
the N8 segment from ducks to chickens occurred between Octo-
ber 2012 and July 2013 (see Fig. S4 in the supplemental material).
For the six internal genes, the tMRCAs of the JX346-like sublin-
eage, containing both H10N8 and H9N2 viruses, were estimated
to range from January to September 2013 (see Fig. S4 in the sup-
plemental material). Thus, the generation of the H10N8 viruses in
chickens appears to be a recent event that most probably occurred
in the middle of 2013.
MolecularcharacterizationofH10N8andH10N6viruses.All
the H10 chicken viruses and the human isolate had an HA Q220R
substitution (residue 210, H3 numbering) relative to the duck
viruses. This residue is located in the trimer interface of the HA
protein (28). This substitution was shown to increase the pH of
virus fusion and viral replication of an H3N2 virus in murine
tracheal epithelial cells and lungs of mice (29). Deletions in the
stalk region of NA are frequently found in viruses that have be-
come established in terrestrial poultry (30, 31); however, deletions
were not seen in N8 of the chicken isolates. The N6 proteins con-
tain a stalk deletion at residues 59 to 69, which was originally
identified in H6N6 viruses established in domestic ducks in south-
ern China (27) and the H5N6 viruses identified in 2013 to 2014.
None of the H10N8 chicken viruses carry the mammalian adap-
tation marker substitution E627K or D701N in the PB2 protein.
However, PB2 of the human case had a mixture of 627E and 627K,
with 627K predominating as the infection progressed (7).
DISCUSSION
The emergence of the H10N8 viruses and the associated human
infections highlight the continual threat posed by the influenza
ecosystem of China (Fig. 5). Our findings demonstrate how key
aspects of the current influenza ecosystem facilitate the emergence
and development of novel influenza viruses in the region, as oc-
curred with the highly pathogenic H5N1 and H9N2 viruses and
the recently emerged H7N9 viruses (5, 6, 32, 33).

Introductions of influenza viruses from migratory waterfowl
(the natural reservoir) through domestic ducks to other poultry
were frequently observed in the last decades (34, 35). As ⬎65% of
the global population of domestic ducks are bred in China
(FAOSTAT [http://faostat.fao.org/]), which forms the largest nat-
ural host population for influenza viruses in the world, these birds
have become the major source of introductions of influenza vi-
ruses to poultry. In this study, ⬎90% of the H10 viruses from
ducks in our surveillance were isolated from domestic ducks in
Jiangxi, especially from sentinel ducks that share their water body
with migratory birds at Poyang Lake (Table 1).
Domestic ducks play a central role in the development of newly
introduced viruses in the poultry system by allowing the viruses to
spread within their large and highly dense population, by main-
taining the local genetic diversity of the viruses through reassort-
ment with other subtypes, and by carrying viruses to LPMs (Fig.
5). After domestic ducks at sentinel duck farms on Poyang Lake
acquired H10 viruses similar to those from migratory birds at the
lake, related viruses appeared at LPMs in the nearby city of Nan-
chang. This pattern has occurred previously with H10 viruses dur-
ing the winter seasons of 2003 to 2004, 2004 to 2005, and 2008 to
2009, although not all introductions persisted or transmitted
through the entire chain (Fig. 1 and 2A and Table 1).
In LPMs, the interaction of different types of poultry facilitates
interspecies transmissions from domestic ducks to terrestrial
poultry. In the emergence of H10N8 viruses, either separate duck
H10 and N8 viruses or a precursor H10N8 virus was introduced to

chickens, followed by reassortment with H9N2 viruses, leading to
the genesis of the H10N8 virus (Fig. 4), which mirrors the scenario
observed in the H7N9 outbreak. The subsequent prevalence and
outbreak of the novel H10N8 viruses at LPMs in Nanchang be-
came the source of human infections. The existence of distinct
genotypes of H10 viruses in chickens, which changed over time,
and the replacement of the NA subtype (Fig. 4) suggest that these
viruses are subject to ongoing selection and adaptation in this new
host species.
Introductions of viruses from aquatic birds to terrestrial poul-
try occur in most regions of the world (36, 37). However, the
current influenza ecosystem of China, associated with the pres-
ence of multiple subtypes of influenza viruses enzootic in terres-
trial poultry, the huge poultry population size and density, the
combination of industrial and mixed-animal backyard farming
practices, and the widespread LPM system, provides a unique set
of conditions that favor the emergence and genesis of novel vi-
ruses. This has been repeatedly demonstrated by the emergence of
H5N1, H9N2, and the recent H7N9 and H10N8 viruses in China.
All these factors make China a unique influenza epicenter for gen-
erating novel viruses with pandemic potential.
This study highlights each of the steps by which the H10N8
virus was generated and evolved (Fig. 4 and 5). Currently, the H10
viruses related to the human infections have been detected only in
Jiangxi, reflecting the early phase of an epizootic. If proper mea-
sures are implemented at this stage, it will be possible to eradicate
these viruses completely. However, the long-term enzootic status
of H9N2 and H5N1 viruses and the recent development of H7N9
viruses in China have demonstrated the inefficacy of current dis-
ease control systems.
To reduce the emergence of novel viruses and control current
enzootic influenza viruses, revolutionary changes to the entire
structure of poultry farming practices, LPMs, and the poultry dis-
tribution system are needed. Otherwise, H10N8 or H10N6 viruses
are likely to disseminate to neighboring regions and follow the
trajectory of the H7N9 outbreak. Coupling surveillance with
changes in the management of LPMs will provide a higher level of
protection against the potential emergence of a pandemic influ-
enza virus from poultry in China.

FIG 5 The current ecosystem of avian influenza viruses in China. The diver-
sity of avian influenza viruses is maintained primarily in the classic gene pool
viruses of wild waterfowl (green circle). Industrial poultry farming (blue and
pink circles) largely separates species, but wild and domestic ducks may inter-
act and transmit viruses. Trading in live-poultry markets (funnel) brings dif-
ferent types of poultry together to facilitate the sharing and mixing of viruses,
favoring the emergence of novel AIVs and interspecies transmission of viruses
(arrows). The markets are the major contact point between humans and live
poultry, and this leads to the transmission of viruses to humans. Improper
management may lead to the transfer of viruses from chickens in LPMs to
those in farms. The stroke weight of an arrow indicates the frequency of trans-
missions between different hosts, arrowheads show the direction, and dashed
lines indicate sporadic transmissions.
