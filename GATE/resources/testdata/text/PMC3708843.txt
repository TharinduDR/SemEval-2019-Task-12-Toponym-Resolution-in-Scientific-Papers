Abstract
Rabies remains a serious problem in China with three epidemics since 1949 and the country in the midst of the third
epidemic. Significantly, the control of each outbreak has been followed by a rapid reemergence of the disease. In 2005, the
government implemented a rabies national surveillance program that included the collection and screening of almost 8,000
samples. In this work, we analyzed a Chinese dataset comprising 320 glycoprotein sequences covering 23 provinces and
eight species, spanning the second and third epidemics. Specifically, we investigated whether the three epidemics are
associated with a single reemerging lineage or a different lineage was responsible for each epidemic. Consistent with
previous results, phylogenetic analysis identified six lineages, China I to VI. Analysis of the geographical composition of
these lineages revealed they are consistent with human case data and reflect the gradual emergence of China I in the third
epidemic. Initially, China I was restricted to south China and China II was dominant. However, as the epidemic began to
spread into new areas, China I began to emerge, whereas China II remained confined to south China. By the latter part of
the surveillance period, almost all isolates were China I and contributions from the remaining lineages were minimal. The
prevalence of China II in the early stages of the third epidemic and its established presence in wildlife suggests that it too
replaced a previously dominant lineage during the second epidemic. This lineage replacement may be a consequence of
control programs that were dominated by dog culling efforts as the primary control method in the first two epidemics. This
had the effect of reducing dominant strains to levels comparable with other localized background stains. Our results
indicate the importance of effective control strategies for long term control of the disease.

Introduction
Rabies is a fatal enzootic disease caused by lyssaviruses and is
distributed throughout most of the world, infecting a wide range of
hosts [1]. In developed countries, where dog rabies has been
effectively controlled, rabies remains epidemic in wild animals,
with the Carnivora and Chiroptera orders acting as the main
reservoirs [2]. However, most of the human cases are reported
in the developing countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America [3].
According to WHO reports, more than 50,000 people die of rabies
annually, with 56% of the fatalities occurring in Asia [2,4].
Domestic dogs act as the main reservoir and are primarily
responsible for the dissemination of the disease [5].
Rabies is widely epidemic in Asia and, after India, China has
the second highest number of human rabies cases [2]. Figure 1
shows a summary of the annual number of human cases in China
between 1950 and the present day. In spite of the variation in the
comprehensiveness of surveillance in earlier years, the figure shows
three epidemic waves over this period [6]. Moreover, the gap
between successive epidemics is brief, with a rapid reemergence of
cases within a few years. The first wave occurred in the 1950s,
reaching a peak in 1957 (1933 cases). The second wave extended
from the 1960s to the middle of 1990s and was the most serious
epidemic with 4000–7000 cases reported annually for most of the
1980s, with a peak of 7037 cases occurring in 1981. China is
currently in the midst of a third wave that peaked in 2007 (3300
cases). Since then, the numbers have begun to gradually decrease,
although there are still around 2000 cases reported every year [6–
8]. Thus, rabies remains a serious public health problem in China
with the continuing threat of a resurgence of the disease.
The Department of Viral Encephalitis, within the National
Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention at the Chinese
Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC), has
been the national reference laboratory for national rabies
surveillance in China since 2005. The laboratory is responsible
for the identification of rabies in patients and animals at a national

level using WHO approved tests, and for the subsequent
characterization and analysis of positive samples. From this data,
together with samples collected by other laboratories, we have
been able to build a picture of the emergence of the most recent
epidemic over the course of several years.
An initial investigation of the data indicated that most of the
cases were located in the South of China and it was only later that
cases began to occur in west and north China [7].In another
paper, using surveillance data, we investigated the epidemiology of
rabies in southern China [9]. We concluded that the spread of
rabies viruses from high incidence regions was facilitated by the
long-distance movement or trans-provincial translocation of dogs
associated with human-related activities and this was likely one of
the factors contributing to the rapid increase in human rabies cases
in new regions [9]. Nevertheless, much remains to be learned
about the epidemiology of the virus in China.
Lyssaviruses are an unsegmented, single-strand, negative strand
RNA viruses of the Rhabdoviridae family. The lyssavirus genome is
approximately 12 kb, with five genes (39–59) encoding the
nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), glyco-
protein (G) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) [1]. As a
consequence of convenience and variability, the N and G genes are
the most commonly sequenced components of the genome and,
based on their genetic similarity, there are currently twelve classified
species within the lyssavirus genus, with an additional two putative
rabies virus species Bokeloh bat lyssavirus and Ikoma lyssavirus [10].
Of these species, rabies virus (RABV) is responsible for classical
rabies in terrestrial mammals globally and in bats on the American
continent, as well as being associated with most rabies-related
human deaths worldwide [11,12]. Although four distinct but
unclassified lyssaviruses, isolated from bats on the Asian continent,
have been found in recent decades, RABV still has a major impact
in Asia and remains of primary concern in China [13,14].
Investigation of the diversity and evolution of rabies virus strains over
the course of an epidemic can help in the development of strategies to
combat and control viral diseases [15,16]. In a recent paper we
investigated the spatial and temporal dynamics of rabies in China
based on N sequences from samples collected from 2003 to 2008 [17].
We found the epidemic was primarily defined by strains that could be
divided into two major lineages which exhibited distinct population
subdivision and translocation patterns. Since then, we have continued
and expanded our surveillance and collected additional positive
samples distributed throughout 13 provinces that were isolated from
dog, human and ferret badger (Melogale moschata). The G protein plays a
pivotal role in pathogenicity and is significantly influenced by host

Author Summary
Since 1949, there have been three rabies epidemics in
China. The country is currently in the midst of a third
epidemic. After the first two epidemics were brought
under control, there was a rapid reemergence of the
disease. In 2005, the government implemented a national
surveillance program and as part of this work, samples
were collected from humans and animals and screened for
rabies. Positive samples were sequenced and combined
with other publicly available sequences to form a dataset
that spanned almost all epidemic regions in China. A
phylogenetic tree was constructed the clustering of
isolates according to geographic origin and lineage was
investigated. We found that most isolates were grouped
into two lineages China I and China II. However, the
proportion of isolates in these lineages changed over time
until almost all new isolates were placed in China I,
indicating it has emerged as the dominant lineage.
Furthermore, the significantly higher number of China II
isolates compared to remaining lineages together with its
established presence in wildlife suggests that it was
dominant in the second epidemic, suggesting that lineage
replacement also occurred during the previous epidemic.

selection pressure [18,19], thus this gene is a good choice for
investigating the epidemiology of a rabies outbreak and hence the
impact of the pathogen. Based on this, we obtained the G sequences for
all new positive specimens isolated in China. While there have been
several reports on the rabies epidemic in China based on the G
sequence [20–22], these have incorporated relativity small datasets that
have limited the analytical methods that could be used. As a
consequence of the trial Chinese national surveillance program, as
well as efforts by other rabies researchers, significantly more isolates
and G sequences are now available, and the geographic distribution (23
provinces) and the range of infected hosts (8 species) has also been
expanded. This more extensive dataset gives us an opportunity to
reinvestigate the current epidemic to see how the characteristics have
changed now the epidemic has become established across a significant
portion of the country. Furthermore, given the temporal range of the
samples, it allows us to compare the properties and characteristics
between epidemics to try and understand how new outbreaks emerged
so rapidly after a previous outbreak was brought under control.
In this work we investigated the phylodynamics of RABV in
China based on the analysis of a comprehensive set of G sequences
collected across the course of the current epidemic and also from
the previous epidemic. We considered how the geographical
dispersion of the lineages predicted from our phylogenetic analysis
reflected the observed epidemiology based on surveillance data
from human cases in the current epidemic. We also investigated
how the prevalence of particular lineages varied within and
between successive epidemics. Specifically, we considered whether
successive epidemics were associated with a single lineage, or
characterized by the emergence of a new lineage.
Materials and Methods
Ethics statement
The program for collection of human brain samples was
approved by the Ethical Committee of the National Institute of
Viral Disease Control and Prevention, China CDC, which is the
national referral center for rabies diagnosis. Due to their medical
condition, subjects were unable to provide consent once a rabies
infection was suspected and so written informed consent was
obtained in all cases from their relatives after death.
Epidemiological data
Data on national human rabies cases from 1950 to 1995 were taken
from the annual reports of the China CDC, formerly named the
Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine prior to 2002 (Figure 1).
Data on human rabies cases from the whole of mainland China for
each province and municipality (a total of 31) between 1996 and 2010
were collected from the annual reports of the China CDC. The
reporting methods and how cases were determined to be associated
with rabies were the same as described previously [17]. Provinces were
classified as high, medium, low or very low incidence regions according
to the recorded number of human cases from 1996 to 2010. In general,
due to the problems of obtaining consent from relatives after a subject
has died from a suspected rabies infection, human cases are not
confirmed by approved by WHO laboratory testing. However, in the
cases when laboratory diagnosis is performed, it was found there was a
very strong correlation between positive outcome and clinical diagnosis
[17]. This is primarily due to the majority of cases being associated with
a bite or scratch from an animal that (laboratory) tested positive for
rabies.
Specimen collection, detection and sequencing
Specimens were collected as part of the trial Chinese national
surveillance program using the same sampling method as described
previously [17]. From 2004 to 2010, 7919 specimens were taken
from dog brain, human brain or saliva, and ferret badger (Melogale
moschata) brain collected in 13 provinces (Hunan, Guangxi,
Guizhou, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, Shanghai, Anhui, Shaanxi,
Jiangxi, Sichuan, Guangdong and Yunnan, Figure 2), and tested for
presence of the rabies virus using direct immunofluorescence assay
(DFA) [9]. Ferret badgers samples were collected from euthanized
animals that had exhibited rabies symptoms and which were found
in farming villages. 112 out of all these samples were confirmed
positive and the complete G gene coding region (1575 nt) of all the
specimens were sequenced by using methods described previously
[23]. All sequences were submitted to GenBank and assigned
accession numbers as listed in Table S1.
Dataset for Chinese rabies G sequences
Additionally, all complete G sequences of rabies street strains (as
of Jan 6, 2011) were downloaded from GenBank. Only isolates
with full background information (isolation time/host/location)
were considered and combined with the newly sequenced samples
to form a final set of 320 sequences (background information of all
sequences are provided in Table S1).
Dataset for world rabies G sequences
To place the Chinese sequences in perspective with worldwide
rabies strains, a second dataset was created that was representative
in terms of host, strain and location. A total of 74 sequences were
selected, 37 were selected from the China sequences (Table S1)
and an additional 37 sequences were selected from the major
worldwide lineages (Table S2), representative of countries
recording rabies cases in domestic animals, livestock and wildlife.
Phylogenetic analysis
A maximum clade credibility (MCC) rooted tree was generated
and nucleotide substitution rates (per site, per year) were estimated
using the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods
implemented in the BEAST package (v1.6.2) [24–27]. The
GTR+I+G model was determined to be the best nucleotide
substitution model using ModelTest [28]. The constant population
size model was selected based on Bayes Factor and both strict and
relaxed (uncorrelated lognormal) molecular clocks [29] were
investigated, and the latter was determined to have the strongest
support when results were analyzed in the TRACER program
(v1.5), also consistent with previous RABV analyses results [30].
For the world rabies dataset, an NJ tree was constructed with 1000
bootstraps to verify the reliability of the predicted tree.
Comparison of rabies variant lineages present in China
The phylogenetic analysis predicted six major clades (China I -
China VI) with high statistical support and which appeared to show
differences in geographical composition. To investigate the
significance of these differences, clades or merged sets of clades
were compared to generate contingency tables and a Pearson’s Chi-
squared test with the Yates’ continuity correction was performed.
H0, the null hypothesis, was defined as: the proportion of cases is
independent of column in the contingency table. HA, the alternative
hypothesis, was defined as: the proportion of cases is different between
columns in the contingency table. Full details are provided in Table S3. As
the China I and China II lineages appeared to be the dominant
variant strains, the differences in the geographical composition of
these two clades were further investigated. The change in
geographical coverage over time was investigated by (i) determining
the number of provinces with sequenced isolates assigned to these
two clades and (ii) determining the land area encompassed by the

provinces with sequenced isolates assigned to these two clades. The
land area of each province is given in Figure 3.
Wildlife dataset
To investigate the contribution from wildlife to rabies in China,
wildlife and domestic sequences from the dataset above were
combined with the dataset generated from our earlier study based
on the N gene to generate a dataset of 368 samples [31]. A
complete list of the wildlife isolates are given in Table S4. We then
used Fisher’s Exact test to identify significant differences between
clade pairs. Full details are given in Table S5.
Analysis of sampling bias
To investigate the possibility of sampling bias, we also
investigated the connectivity between human cases (Table S6)
and sequenced isolates (Figure 3) by calculating the Pearson’s
correlation coefficient, according to geographical location (prov-
ince) and summed over isolation dates (Table S7). The correlation
was tested using the Pearson test. We further investigated the
connectivity between human cases/isolate numbers and provincial
population density. Population density data is taken from national
census data and is provided in Figure 3. No provinces reported a
significant change in population over the surveillance period.
Results
Characteristics and distribution of the current rabies
epidemic in China
1996 marked the beginning of a third rabies epidemic in China.
From this point the number of human cases increased every year,
reaching a peak in 2007. Subsequently, there has been a gradual
decrease in the annual cases. Over the course of the epidemic the
geographic distribution has spread to encompass almost the entire

classified into high, medium, low or very low incidence regions. The map shows the provinces are grouped according to incidence and reflects the
spread of the epidemic from its origin in south China to the bordering medium incidence regions and out to the low and very low incidence regions.

country and certain characteristics have begun to emerge. Figure 3
(full data is supplied in Table S6) shows the total number of cases
by region from 1996 to 2010. Based on this data, we divided
mainland China into 4 regions according to the number of human
cases. Guangxi, Hunan, Guizhou and Guangdong, located in the
South of China, with 4240-2725 cases, were classified as high
incidence regions. The medium incidence regions, with 1404-254
cases, were composed of 13 provinces adjacent, or close to, the
high incidence regions. The low incidence regions comprised
Shanxi, Shaanxi, Inner Mongolia and the three municipalities of
Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai, (96-23 cases) which are located in
the north and west of China. The very low incidence regions
consisted of Jilin, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Xinjiang, Gansu, Tibet,
Ningxia and Qinghai, all of which are located in the northeast and
west of China. These regions are the most distant from the high
incidence regions and have experienced almost no human cases in
the last 15 years (0–10 cases). Thus, the majority of cases are
located in the south of China and there is a gradual decrease in the
number of cases towards the north and west of the country.
Phylogenetic analysis indicates the majority of Chinese
rabies cases are associated with two lineages
We next investigated the diversity and relationship amongst
Chinese samples by constructing a phylogenetic tree based on our
assembled set of G sequences of China street strains. The 320
strains, spanning 1969–2010, were isolated from dogs, humans,
deer, mice, cattle, pigs, raccoon dogs and ferret badgers (Melogale
moschata), and originated from 23 provinces that represent all of the
high, medium and low incidence regions shown in Figure 2, with
the exception of Hainan province. In addition, samples from
Ningxia province, a very low incidence region, were also included.
The Maximum Clade Credibility (MCC) tree estimated by the
BEAST software package is shown in Figure 4. The tree shows
China strains form six major lineages or clades, China I to China
VI, with high support. Figure 5 shows the relationship of these
clades with respect to global lineages. China I, China II, China V
and China VI are sub-lineages of the Asian clade, China III
corresponds to Cosmopolitan and China IV corresponds to Arctic-
like. The limited number of sequences for China III to VI makes it
difficult to establish the exact relationship amongst the lineages,
but it appears that China I represents the youngest strain in the
China tree. However, this lineage is distributed throughout 19
provinces and accounts for more than 80% of all strains (254/320).
China II, the second most prevalent clade, includes 49 strains from
7 provinces and accounts for 15% of the samples. The remaining
four clades (China III, IV, V, and VI) only account for 5% of the
strains, are circulating in limited regions and have little association
with the current epidemic (Table S3).
China I can be further divided into subclades I-A and I-B with
high support (Figure 4 and Table S1). The I-A subclade contains
almost all of the China I strains, and can be further divided into
eight branches, also with strong support and are of primary
interest. These branches are named A1 to A8 according to their
branching order in the tree, with A1 corresponding to the oldest
branch and A8 the youngest branch. A8 contains almost half of
the China I isolates distributed across 15 provinces, and represents
the most important branch from a epidemiological standpoint.
The China II clade can also be divided into two subclades II-A
and II-B. The 8 ferret badger isolates from Zhejiang and Jiangxi
are placed in subclade II-A, and the other 41 strains are placed in
subclade II-B and, with the exception of one Henan strain, they all
originate from high incidence regions.

(M), low(L) and very low (V) incidence regions defined in Figure 2. The first two columns after the province name show the population and population
density for each province. The subsequent columns correspond to the clades and subclades defined in the tree in Figure 4 and show the number of
isolates collected for each province and clade/subclade combination. Rightmost column shows the total number of isolates collected for each
province. Bottom two rows show the total number of isolates and total number of provinces in each clade/subclade.

Consistent with earlier studies, isolates are classified into six major clades China I to VI, with China I and II containing the majority of samples.
However, the tree is distinct from previous results in that there are relatively fewer isolates placed in clade II, indicating that China I is now the
dominant clade. This clade can be further subdivided into eight major branches with high support. The figure also shows the distribution of hosts
throughout the clades. The majority of isolates are from dogs, but human isolates are marked with an X (left column) domesticated animals such as

Geographical structure of the estimated tree reflects
human case data
To investigate the geographical composition of the sample set
according to province or region, the 320 strains were divided
according to province/incidence region and the clades, subclades
or branches defined in the previous section (Figure 3).
The figure summarizes the composition of each clade, subclade
or branch (column) according to province or municipality (row).
The dominant role of China I is apparent from the number of
samples that are placed in this clade. However, additional patterns
are also apparent when considering the relationship amongst the
various incidence regions and the defined clades. First of all, the
number of clades, subclades or branches associated with each
province appears to be greatest for the high incidence regions. The
only exception is Guangdong province but this is because only a
limited number strains have been made publicly available from
this region. Secondly, geographical clustering is evident in the
composition of the six China clades. Almost all of the strains from
high incidence regions are placed in the China I and China II
clades. The II-B strains originate from high incidence regions, with
the exception of a Henan strain isolated in 1993, suggesting that
this subclade circulated in the early phase of the third epidemic,
but failed to spread further as the epidemic became more
established.
The China I branches show a more complex pattern of
geographical composition. Branches I-A3, I-A5 and I-A7 are
primarily composed of isolates from high incidence regions, but
also contain several isolates from medium incidence regions. The
remaining branches show increased mixing of isolates from high,
medium and low incidence regions. I-A8, the youngest branch,
contains the largest number of sequences and these were isolated
from high, medium and low incidence regions, but with the most
isolates collected from the medium incidence regions and the
fewest isolates collected from high incidence regions.
To investigate whether the differences in the geographical
composition of the branches were significant, we compared branch
I-A8 and to the combined set of strains from I-A1 to A7 and
performed a statistical comparison as described in the Materials
and Methods. Our results indicate that an extremely significant
difference exists in the proportions of isolates from high, medium
and low incidence regions for I-A8 and the remaining branches
(P = 9.126610214
). This difference extends to the differences in
the proportions of low to medium, and medium to high for these
branches (Full details of the analysis are given in Table S3). Thus,
the composition of the branches within the China I-A subclade
reflects the observed spread of human cases over time from high to
medium and low incidence regions. The older clades are primarily
composed of sequences from high incidence regions. The primary
exception to this pattern is the isolation of samples from the low
case region of Neimenggu (Inner Mongolia) that are placed in the
China IV/Arctic-like clade. This suggests that this lineage plays a
minor role in the epidemic, further supported by our recently
published results investigating the relationship amongst China
rabies and lineages in neighbouring countries [31].
The number of human cases continued to increase in
medium and low incidence regions after the number of
national cases decreased
The classification of human case numbers into high, medium,
low and very low incidence regions was based on data collected
nationally between 1996 to 2010 (Figure 1 - third wave). Figure 6
shows the same data for the third wave but broken down into the
number of cases for the high, medium and low incidence regions.
Coincident with cases at the national level, the numbers of cases
for the high incidence regions peaked in 2006 and then began to
decrease gradually. For the medium incidence regions, cases
peaked a year later in 2007 and then began to decrease in
accordance with the high incidence regions. However, for the low
incidence regions, there were almost no cases until 2007 but after
this point the number of cases began to increase at a similar rate to
that seen at the beginning of the third wave in the high incidence
regions. The maximum number of cases occurred in 2010 and it
seems numbers will continue to increase. Thus, over the course of
the epidemic the burden appears to have shifted from the high to
medium and low incidence regions and is now encroaching into
regions which have until recently recorded few events.
China I has emerged to become the dominant lineage in
the current rabies epidemic
To further examine the contributions of the China I and II
lineages to the current epidemic, we next investigated the change
in their geographical distribution over the course of the epidemic.
Graphs of the number of provinces reporting isolates from these
two lineages and the total land area for reporting provinces are
shown in Figure 7a and 7b respectively. These figures show that in
the early stages of the current epidemic, the two lineages spread
into new regions at similar rates but, after 2004, China I
underwent a rapid geographic expansion whereas China II
remained within its existing region of influence, further highlight-
ing the dominance of the former lineage.
Wildlife isolates are almost exclusively isolated with older
lineages
The two major lineages also show differences in their host
composition (Figure 4). Despite the geographic expansion of China
I and the association of the majority of new isolates with this
lineage, the samples were isolated almost exclusively from dogs,
with almost all the remaining samples collected from humans and
domesticated animals. Only two samples were isolated from
wildlife (deer and ferret badger). Conversely, for the China II, III
and IV lineages, a larger proportion of isolates were collected from
wildlife (Table 1). No wildlife isolates were collected for lineages
China V and VI, but the total number of isolates were small for
both these clades. Pairwise comparison of the China I, II, III and
IV lineages using the Fisher’s Exact test revealed that China I had
a distinct host composition from China II (P = 2.7461029
),
whereas the composition of China II and China III (Cosmopol-
itan) were indistinguishable (P = 1). However, a significance
difference was predicted between China III and China IV
(Arctic-like clade) (P = 0.0048). Full details of the statistical tests
are given in Table S5.
Sample isolation reflects the epidemic
One of the goals of the current national rabies surveillance
program is the collection of isolates from regions where rabies
cases have been reported in order to obtain a characteristic
dataset. To investigate whether the collection program is a
reasonable representation of the current epidemic, we compared
the total number of isolates collected from each province to the
corresponding total number of human cases recorded for that
province (Table S7). The calculated Pearson’s correlation coeffi-
cient was r = 0.7189 (p-value: 3.557610206
) indicating the
presence of a strong correlation and that, overall, the collected
isolates were representative of the current rabies epidemic in
China (Figure 8). We also compared the number of collected
isolates to the population and the population density of each

province respectively. We found a weaker but significant
correlation for provincial population versus sampling/number of
cases (r = 0.4801772, p = 0.006/r = 0.4596770, p = 0.009). This
reflects that many of the medium and high case regions represent
some of the largest provincial populations. It is more informative
that there was no measurable correlation between population
density and sampling/number of cases (r = 20.08634058,
p = 0.6442/r = 0.04543189, p = 0.8083)- i.e, highly populated
regions, including major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai or
Chongqing with better resources, are not being preferentially
sampled.
Discussion
In the face of the most recent rabies epidemic, the Chinese
government implemented a trial national surveillance program in
an attempt to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms
driving the reemergence of the disease. Previous studies have
revealed evidence of epidemic waves in other countries that are
proposed to be synchronous with and in response to vaccination
programs, as well as revealing the role of humans in the dispersion
of the virus [32,33], but this is the most comprehensive study to
date in terms of the size of the geographic region and a time period
that spanned the presence and absence of vaccination and other
control programs.
Traditionally, rabies epidemics have been tracked in terms of
surveillance data that presents a statistic such as number of human
cases. With advances in analytical techniques and the extensive
virus sequence data obtained from the trial surveillance program
(as well as other sequences submitted to GenBank) it is now
possible to investigate the genetic diversity of the variant strains to
learn about the origins, expansion and evolutionary dynamics of
the current epidemic. In this work, we analyzed a comprehensive
sequence set covering almost all epidemic regions in China. While
the identification of 6 major RABV lineages is consistent with
other results from recent studies, it is the change in the
composition of these clades that is informative. In 2007, only 3
RABV lineages were found in the south of China [9], but by 2008,
rabies virus samples collected from 15 provinces were associated
with 4 distinct lineages, all of which were present in the south of
the country [17]. Current reports now indicate there are now 6
lineages of RABV [20,23].
The emergence of the China I lineage and the gradual
displacement of China II is also apparent when comparing our
dataset with those used in other recent studies [9,17,20]. Whereas
there were comparable numbers of China I and China II strains in
the earlier study, almost all the strains collected in this study in
2009 and 2010 from 9 provinces belonged to the China I lineage
(Table S1). Furthermore, the geographical dispersion patterns
determined in our analysis are consistent with the patterns
observed in human case data. Both datasets show the south
provinces are the source of the current outbreak and the number
of human cases decreases according to geographical distance from
this region.
Our phylodynamic analysis reveals additional patterns and
characteristics of the current epidemic. Figure 7 shows how rapidly
Figure 6. Number of rabies cases in high, medium and low incidence regions, 1996–2010. The graph shows the same data as figure 1, but
according to the high, medium and low incidence regions defined in figure 2. The graph shows that while the number of cases in the high incidence
regions peaked in 2006, consistent with national data, the number of cases in the medium incidence regions continued to rise for another year
(marked by arrows at the top of the graph). The number of cases in low incidence regions continues to rise.

China I displaced China II and gained dominance. Furthermore,
comparison with Figure 6 suggests that the recent cases in
previously rabies free provinces are associated with this lineage;
the number of human cases in high and medium case regions
began to decrease in 2006 and 2007 respectively, but this
coincided with the rapid expansion of China I. Also, as China I
was becoming established, the remaining lineages China III to VI
were playing a progressively less significant role in the epidemic. In
contrast to the second wave and early stages of the third wave,
only a few strains from these clades have been isolated in recent
years and have been located within a narrow geographic range,
suggesting that some of them may be disappearing.
The significant differences in the host range of the lineages is
also informative. China I isolates are almost exclusively from dogs,
domestic animals and human cases, whereas China II, III and IV
contains a far higher proportion of wildlife isolates; it is only
recently that China I strains have been isolated in wildlife. This
data appears to highlight the fundamental role of dogs in the
spread of the disease as well as the dissemination of a new lineage
and it appears the spillover into wildlife only occurs once the
lineage is well established.
The phylogenetic analysis, together with the observation that
lineages China II, China III and IV are established in wildlife,
suggests that they were dominant in earlier epidemics. However,
the greater number of China II isolates compared to these other
lineages and the observed displacement of this lineage in recent
years suggests that China II was dominant in the second epidemic
and that another lineage (possibly China III, V or VI) was
dominant in the first epidemic. It seems unlikely that China IV has
played a significant role in the major rabies epidemics in China (in
terms of dog and human cases) as isolates are few and restricted to
the north west of the country, and most of the isolates were
obtained from wildlife. The rapid emergence of China I indicates
that, although it was present in previous epidemics, this lineage is
responsible for the current epidemic. Figure S1 summarizes the
temporal, geographical and phylogenetic classification of the
various strains. In particular, the figure shows the minimal
contribution from lineages China III, IV, V & VI in the current
epidemic, and how successive sub-lineages of China I gradually
spread across the country while China II remained constrained to
the southwestern provinces.
These dispersion patterns cannot be attributed to any identified
sampling bias as our statistical analysis indicate the isolates selected
for sequencing and used in this analysis are highly representative
of the national situation according to human cases. Also, we
identified no correlation between number of isolates and
provincial population density. This suggests that the current
surveillance program, based on standard reporting protocols at the
local level and coordination at the national level, is effective at
capturing the current rabies situation in China. The notable
exception is Guangdong province, which is a high case region, but
few sequences have been made publicly available. It is hoped that
this situation will change in the near future so that the rabies
situation in this province can be fully evaluated.
One important distinction between the current and earlier
epidemics is the methods that were implemented to try and bring
the outbreak under control. In the first two epidemics, in the
absence of widespread vaccination programs, dog culling and
restrictions on dog ownership (Notice for strengthening work on
rabies prevention and control. 1984. http://law.lawtime.cn/
d564741569835.html) were the primary methods for containing
the virus [34]. As discussed above, recordkeeping was not as
precise in the earlier epidemics, but the general features of the
graph in figure 1 nevertheless highlight the limitations of culling as
an effective control measure. Although the widespread culling was
implemented in the middle of the second epidemic, it was more
than ten years before the number of cases was brought under
control. Furthermore, the numbers actually increased after the
introduction of a nationwide culling program. While the reasons
for this are not entirely clear, it may well have been a consequence
of the implementation of a national culling program. Previously,
dog culling efforts were in place, but they were directed by
provincial or city government and there was a delay before
nationally coordinated program could become functional. Fur-
thermore, our analysis of the geographical and temporal
dispersion of RABV strains indicates that, rather than producing
widespread eradication of hosts in a short time, it resulted in a
number of isolated strains in specific regions. When the culling
program was finally halted, there were several strains circulating
which were able to compete for dominance. Of these, the China I
lineage was able to emerge, while the other lineages remained
within their limited geographic range. This also helps us to
understand the relatively low estimates for the TMRCA of rabies
in China. Despite records of the disease extending back more than
2500 years, estimates based on coalescence date the origin to no
more than a few hundred years [20,21]. The common explanation
is the original lineage has died out and been replaced by newer
ones [30], our results showing the emergence of China I in the
most recent epidemic is the first evidence that this does indeed
occur.
The expansion of the epidemic into low incidence regions is a
cause for concern. Prior to 2007, there were less than 10 human
rabies cases reported in these regions in the last 10 years (Table
S3). Since then, the number of human cases in these regions has
increased as the number of cases have begun to decrease at a
national level [23]. New strains isolated in 2011 in Shanxi, Inner
Mongolia and Ningxia are genetically close I-A8 strains [23],
indicating that this lineage is already becoming established
throughout the low incidence regions and is beginning to expand
into very low incidence regions. This is also supported by data that
has been collected after the reported study period. In 2011, the
reported cases in Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Shaanxi and Shanghai,
corresponding to low incidence regions (Figure 3), doubled over
the previous year. Moreover, Ningxia, Xinjiang, Liaoning and
Heilongjiang provinces, which have had no cases reported in
lineage. In the early stages of the epidemic, the two clades showed similar dispersion patterns, but after 2005 China I rapidly expanded whereas
China II isolates were only collected in existing regions.

recent years (Table S3), began to report their first cases in 2011 or
2012.
The rapid emergence of a third epidemic wave so rapidly after
the second epidemic had been controlled highlights the challenge
of completely eradicating rabies. The geography of high incidence
regions such as Guangxi, Hunan and Guizhou makes it possible
for disease reservoirs to exist in remote or inaccessible regions and
the custom of eating dog meat ensures the continual presence of
localized concentrations of dog populations, which further benefits
the survival of RABV [9]. On a more positive note, our analysis
shows that the recent introduction of alternative control measures
are proving effective in combating the spread of the disease and
reducing the number of human cases. In particular, trial dog
vaccination programs implemented in some high case regions in
the southwest provinces have highlighted the effectiveness of
vaccination for rabies control. These successes are reflected in the
recent announcement of a new draft plan for rabies control by the
Ministry of Agriculture and Health. These new regulations place
emphasis on rabies control at the source, emphasizing vaccination
of domestic animals, especially in rural areas. In the next phase of
the program, vaccination will be extended to additional regions to
incorporate more of the dog population. Furthermore, the
integration of postexposure prophylaxis costs into welfare
programs combined with rabies education as well as introduction
of animal registration policies yielded a reduction in the number of
cases at the national level within two years. This highlights the
importance of continuing these programs as well as establishing
similar programs in low incidence regions before the disease can
become further established, leading to a reemergence of human
cases.

Conversely, the horizontal arrow marks the data collected for China
I-A6 for Shandong province. This is a larger diameter circle, but
there is less solid color, so the data has been collected at a later time,
but within a relatively limited time period (2005–2008). The circles
in the older clades (II, III, IV, IV, VI) generally have smaller circle
suggesting these clades were rarely sampled in the current epidemic.
Also, in these older clades, the circles are very close together on the
y-axis, indicating limited geographical dispersal. Conversely, the
circles in the newer China I generally have larger circles with a
narrow line. This means they are commonly sampled in the current
epidemic, but were not sampled in the previous epidemics.
Additionally, the circles are more spread out on the y-axis indicating
greater geographical dispersal. For branches A2 to A8, there is
gradual increase in the geographical dispersal, consistent with the
observed spread of the epidemic.
