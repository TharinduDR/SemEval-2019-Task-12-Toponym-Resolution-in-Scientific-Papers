To study influenza viruses in pigs in Sri Lanka, we ex-
amined samples from pigs at slaughterhouses. Influenza
(H3N2) and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were prevalent during
2004–2005 and 2009–2012, respectively. Genetic and epi-
demiologic analyses of human and swine influenza viruses
indicated 2 events of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus spillover from
humans to pigs.
Data on swine influenza in southern Asia are limited (1–
3). Sri Lanka is an island in this region with a human
population of 21 million and a swine population of ≈83,785
(4,5). Pigs are not routinely imported into Sri Lanka. Most
(61%) swine farms are located in the western costal belt
spanning the Puttlam, Gampaha, Colombo, and Kalutara
districts. In 2010, for these 4 districts, pig population
densities were 7, 15, 12, and 1 animal per km2
, respectively
(4,5). In 2001, for these districts, the human population
densities were 246, 1,539, 3,330, and 677 persons per km2
,
respectively (6).
The Study
During 2004–2005 and 2009–2012, tracheal and na-
sal swab and serum samples were collected from pigs
at government slaughterhouses in Sri Lanka (Table 1).
Culture tubes with MDCK cells were inoculated with the
swab samples, and 2 blind passages were made. Also, em-
bryonated eggs were inoculated by the allantoic route with
swab samples collected during 2004–2005. Virus isolates
were subtyped by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) test-
ing and neuraminidase inhibition testing with reference
antiserum as described (7,8), and results were confirmed
by sequencing the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase gene
segments.
RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, PCR, genome
sequencing (9), and one-step quantitative real-time reverse
transcription (RT-PCR) for rapid genotyping of all 8 gene
segments (10) of A(H1N1)pdm09 isolates were performed
as described. Methods used for the phylogenetic analysis are
described in online Technical Appendix 1 (wwwnc.cdc.gov/
EID/article19/3/12-0945-Techapp1.pdf).GenBankaccession
numbers assigned to the sequences determined in this study
are KC197816–KC197855 and KC190041–KC190078.
Serum samples were tested by HAI as described (8)
by using the virus antigens shown in Table 2. The number
of human influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses detected
by RT-PCR in Sri Lanka during July 2009–March 2012
was obtained from the World Health Organization FluNet
and from the Epidemiology Unit, Ministry of Health, Sri
Lanka (11,12). Seven A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses isolated
from humans during 2009–2011 were obtained from the
National Center for Influenza, Medical Research Institute,
Sri Lanka, and were genetically sequenced as described
above. Genetic sequence data of the hemagglutinin gene
of 5 additional human A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses isolated in
Sri Lanka were provided by the World Health Organization
Influenza Collaborating Centre, Melbourne, Australia.
One influenza A virus, A/swine/Colombo/48/
2004(H3N2), was isolated in MDCK cells from a tracheal
swab sample collected in 2004–2005. All genes of this
virus were closely related to human influenza (H3N2)
virus isolate A/Ragama/190/2003 from Sri Lanka and to
other subtype H3N2 influenza viruses isolated worldwide
at this time (data not shown). During January 2004–March
2005, a total of 185 (61.6%) of 300 serum samples tested
were positive for A/swine/Colombo/48/2004(H3N2);
HAI titers ranged from 40 to >1,280 (Table 2), indicating
that this human-like influenza (H3N2) virus was
widespread in the swine population. Serum samples
collected from swine during 2009–2012 were also mostly
seronegative to this and to more contemporary human
influenza (H3N2) viruses.

Of the nasal and tracheal swab samples collected
from 2,710 pigs during 2009–2012, a total of 26 (0.5%)
viruses were isolated in MDCK cells; all were identified
as A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. All 8 gene segments of these
viruses were similar to those of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus; no
evidence of reassortment with other swine or human viruses
was found. These isolates were collected on 12 sampling
occasions from apparently healthy pigs on 7 farms. The 2
peaks of A(H1N1)pdm09 detection in swine followed peaks
of human A(H1N1)pdm09 outbreaks that occurred during
June 2009–January 2010 and October 2010–February
2011, which represented the first and second waves of the
pandemic in Sri Lanka (Figure 1). Overall, virus yield was
higher from nasal swab samples than from tracheal swab
samples (Table 1).
Phylogenetic analysis showed that the 15 A(H1N1)
pdm09 viruses isolated from swine during October 2009–
July 2010 clustered together and with other A(H1N1)
pdm09 viruses isolated from humans during this period.
In contrast, swine A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses isolated in
2011 clustered separately from swine viruses isolated
during 2009-2010 and clustered with human A(H1N1)
pdm09 viruses isolated in 2010 and 2011 in Sri Lanka and
elsewhere (Figure 2). The amino acid signature changes
occurring within human A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses in the
first and second pandemic waves are reflected in the

corresponding waves of swine infections, and each linage
that occurred in swine led to extinction (online Technical
Appendix 2, wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/article/19/3/12-0945-
Techapp2.pdf). This finding suggests that the A(H1N1)
pdm09 infections among swine that occurred during
January–February 2011 were separate spillover events
from the second wave of human infections during
October 2010–February 2011 rather than from continued
epizootic transmission among swine from October 2009.
The upper 95% CI of the prevalence of each viral genetic
variant, given no positive isolates since the last detection,
declined to almost zero during the course of observation,
indicating probable extinction of these genetic variants
(online Technical Appendix 2).
On some sampling occasions, A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses
were isolated from multiple pigs from the same farm, and
on 1 sampling occasion, isolates came from multiple pigs
(from the same farm) slaughtered 9 days apart. In such
instances, with 1 exception, we found viruses from the
same farm to be genetically identical, suggesting continued
circulation of the virus in swine herds.
Swine serum samples collected in 2004–2005
showed no seroprevalence to A(H1N1)pdm09, A/
California/4/2009, and A/swine/Colombo/330/2009
viruses (Table 2). In 2010, seroprevalence to A(H1N1)
pdm09 virus was detected (Figure 1). After peaking in
February 2011, seroprevalence declined to undetectable
levels in April–May 2012, suggesting that the A(H1N1)
pdm09 virus was not sustaining transmission among
pigs in the absence of continued human infection. The
maximum cross-correlation between incidence of human
and swine virus isolates was found after an 8-week lag,
indicating that the rise in incidence of human virus
preceded that in swine by 7–8 weeks (online Technical
Appendix 2).
Conclusions
Isolation of human-like influenza A (H3N2) and
A(H1N1)pdm09-like viruses from pigs in Sri Lanka
probably represents spillover infection from humans, with
self-limited transmission and extinction within pig herds.
This finding might reflect characteristics of swine husbandry
in Sri Lanka, where swine population density in the study
area is relatively low (7.7 pigs/km2
), or other factors (5,13).
Genetic characterization of individual gene segments of
all influenza (H3N2) and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses from
swine showed no evidence of genetic reassortment. This
finding contrasts with those from Hong Kong, Thailand,
Argentina, and the United States, where reassortment of
A(H1N1)pdm09 with other swine influenza viruses has
reportedly occurred (14,15). This contrast might reflect the
low prevalence of other swine influenza virus lineages (e.g.,
classical swine, Eurasian avian-like and triple-reassortant

swine) endemic to Sri Lanka. With the exception of subtype
H3N2 viruses (Table 2), no evidence of other endemic
swine influenza viruses circulating in swine in the country
before the emergence of the A(H1N1)pdm09 in 2009 was
found, and influenza (H3N2) virus in swine became extinct
around the time of the spillover of A(H1N1)pdm09 to swine.
These observations might explain the lack of emergence of
A(H1N1)pdm09 reassortants among swine. It might also
indicate that A(H1N1)pdm09, although able to spill over
from humans to swine, is not ideally adapted to establish
sustained transmission among swine in the absence of further
reassortment with other swine influenza virus lineages.
