Abstract: Slovenia is a very diverse country from a natural geography point of view,
with many different habitats within a relatively small area, in addition to major
geological and climatic differences. It is therefore not surprising that several small
mammal species have been confirmed to harbour hantaviruses: A. flavicollis
(Dobrava virus), A. agrarius (Dobrava virus–Kurkino), M. glareolus (Puumala
virus), S. areanus (Seewis virus),M. agrestis, M. arvalis and M. subterraneus
(Tula virus). Three of the viruses, namely the Dobrava, Dobrava–Kurkino and
Puumala viruses, cause disease in humans, with significant differences in the severity
of symptoms. Due to changes in haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome cases
(HFRS) epidemiology, a detailed study on phylogenetic diversity and molecular
epidemiology of pathogenic and non-pathogenic hantaviruses circulating in
ecologically diverse endemic regions was performed. The study presents one of the
largest collections of hantavirus L, M and S sequences obtained from hosts and
patients within a single country. Several genetic lineages were determined for each
hantavirus species, with higher diversity among non-pathogenic compared to
pathogenic viruses. For pathogenic hantaviruses, a significant geographic clustering

of human- and rodent-derived sequences was confirmed. Several geographic and
ecological factors were recognized as influencing and limiting the formation of
endemic areas.

1. Introduction
In Slovenia, the first hantavirus infection was described in 1954, when a patient was infected
presumably with the Puumala virus (PUUV) during forestry work in the Pohorje region [1].
Following a number of severe haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome cases (HFRS) in the
southeastern part of Slovenia, the Dobrava virus (DOBV) was isolated in 1988 from the lungs of
a yellow-necked mouse captured in Dobrava village. In 1992, it was fully characterized and
recognized as a unique hantavirus species [2]. Since then, epidemic outbreaks and sporadic cases
have been recorded yearly, with the highest numbers recorded in 2012 (188 cases). The overall
case fatality rate is 4.5% [3]. Co-existence of both DOBV and PUUV in a single endemic region
has been demonstrated and it was shown that the viruses are capable of causing HFRS with
significant differences in severity [3]. Initial genetic analysis of DOBV sequenced from rodents
and patients revealed that DOBV in Slovenia is harboured by two distinct species of Apodemus
mice: A. favicollis and A. agrarius. Phylogenetic analysis provided strong evidence that two
distinct DOBV genotypes are present in Slovenia (Dobrava and Kurkino), but until now, only
DOBV–Dobrava was detected in patients [4]. Investigation of Slovenian HFRS cases caused by
PUUV has shown the existence of two distinct genetic lineages that are grouping based on their
geographical origin [5]. Besides pathogenic, also non-pathogenic hantaviruses (Tula and Seewis
viruses) circulate in the same zoonotic regions. High genetic diversity was detected in the Tula
virus (TULV), amplified from three different Microtus sp. within a single endemic region.
Slovenian TULV sequences showed significant geographical clustering instead of host-specific
co-evolution [6]. Furthermore, three highly divergent genetic lineages of the Seewis virus
(SWSV), detected in S. araneus, were recently reported in Slovenia. Contrary to other
hantaviruses circulating in the country, SWSV does not cluster into geographic lineages, and two
genetic lineages are sympatric in one study location [7].
Increasing amplitude and magnitude of HFRS outbreaks in the country and availability of
diverse animal collection has enabled us to perform a detailed study on the phylogenetic
diversity and molecular epidemiology of pathogenic and non-pathogenic hantaviruses.
2. Results and Discussion
2.1. Description of Zoogeographic Regions
Slovenia is formed of five zoogeographic regions: Submediterranean, Dinaric, Alpine,
Prealpine and Subpannonian [8]. The formation of these regions is influenced by several abiotic
factors, which influence the formation of the habitats: tectonic, lithological, relief, climatic and
Viruses 2013, 5 3073
edaphic conditions. Tectonically, Slovenia is formed of the eastern and southern Alps, the
Pannonic basin, and the Dinarides. The lithographic variability is also great, with the majority of
Slovenia being rich in limestone and dolomites (Dinaric, Alpine and parts of Prealpine and
Submediterranean regions), igneous rocks in the Prealpine region, slates, sandstones and
limestone in the Subpannonian region and flysch in the Submediterranean part. Major rivers
running through all the regions additionally influence the formation of zoogeographic areas, and
are recognized as the zones of highest biological diversity and intense human activity. The
Alpine region is also determined by its mountainous relief, which influences its climate and
vegetation, comprised mostly of coniferous boreal type and subalpine broad-leaved forest. These
forests continue into the Prealpine region, though more lowland forests, rich with beech and
spruce, are evident. The Submediterranean region has a lot of influence from the Mediterranean
climate, enabling the growth of oak forests, which can also be found in the Subpannonian region,
where the climate is continental. The Dinaric region has many hills and sinkholes; the climate is
relatively stable and humid, with microclimate areas forming due to its dynamic relief. The
forests are mostly broad-leaved, with a significant presence of beech [8].
2.2. Collection of Animal Samples and Detection of Hantavirus RNA
Small mammals were trapped in spring and autumn, in different locations in Slovenia from
1990–2012. In total, 2,393 animals of several species—Apodemus sp.; Myodes glareolus;
Microtus sp.; Mus musculus; Glis glis; Arvicola terrestris; Crocidura sp.; Neomys. sp;, and Sorex
sp.—were trapped, and the majority of them were molecularly tested for the presence of
hantaviruses. Out of 420 molecularly tested M. glareolus, hantavirus RNA was detected in 49
(11.6%). Molecular testing of 760 A. favicollis confirmed hantavirus RNA in 148 (19.5%). Out
of 85 tested, A. agrarius, hantavirus RNA was detected in nine animals (10.6%). Furthermore,
75 other voles and shrews were captured (two A. terrestris, eight M. agrestis, 15 M. arvalis, five
M. nivalis, three M. liechtensteini, one M. subterraneus, four C. leucodon, four C. suaveolens, 12
N. anomalus, eight N. fodiens, one S. alpinus and 12 S. araneus). Hantavirus RNA was
confirmed in six voles (four M. arvalis, one M. agrestis, one M. subterraneus) and in seven
common shrews (S. araneus).
For the purpose of the present study, 98 animal samples were selected from all five
zoogeographic regions in Slovenia; PUUV sequences were obtained from 40 bank voles,
DOBV–Dobrava sequences were obtained from 36 yellow-necked mice, DOBV–Kurkino
sequences were obtained from nine striped field mice, TULV sequences from six voles and
SWSV sequences from seven shrews (Figure 1).
2.3. Collection of Patient Samples and Detection of Hantavirus RNA
A total of 506 HFRS patients, 132 infected with DOBV and 374 infected with PUUV, have
been hospitalized in Slovenia between the years 1985 and 2012. For the purpose of the study,
multiplex real- time (RT-PCR) positive patients from different endemic regions were selected.
PUUV sequences were obtained from 65 patients; DOBV–Dobrava sequences were amplified
from 30 patients and fromDOBV–Kurkino sequences were also obtained from one patient.

regions of Slovenia.
2.4. Phylogenetic Analysis L Segment Sequences
For investigation of phylogenetic diversity of pathogenic (DOBV, DOBV–Kurkino and
PUUV) and non-pathogenic (TULV and SWSV) hantaviruses present in Slovenia, partial L
segment sequences were successfully amplified from 97 rodent and 96 patient samples. Bayesian
phylogenetic analysis confirmed the presence of five hantavirus genotypes, PUUV, DOBV,
DOBV-Kurkino, TULV and SWSV, belonging to four hantavirus species (Figure 2).

MCMC runs of 10,000,000 generations. The table shows the number of obtained
sequences from small mammals and patients, as well as pairwise nucleotide (nt) and
deduced amino acid (aa) distances.
Nucleotide and deduced amino acid distances are shown in Figure 2, where the highest
nucleotide diversity was observed within SWSV (14.1%) amplified from common shrews
captured in three different localities. High nucleotide diversity (12.8%) was determined also in
TULV amplified from three different Microtus sp., where sequences grouped into two
phylogenetic lineages according to their geographic origin (Figure 2). In total, 105 PUUV
sequences were determined, with divergence ranging from 0%–9.5% on the nucleotide level and
up to 3.9% on the deduced amino acid level. Human and bank vole-derived PUUV sequences
were correlated within specific geographic areas; sequences clustered into three major
phylogenetic lineages ranging from the Subpannonian to the Submediterranean region (Figure
2). All DOBV–Dobrava sequences, derived only from yellow-necked mice, were closely related
to each other and to DOBV sequences amplified from patients (nucleotide diversity 0%–9.0%).
Above that, a clear geographic clustering showed the existence of three phylogenetic lineages.
Additionally to the already established presence of DOBV–Kurkino genotype in striped field
mice in the Subpannonian region, the same genotype was determined in the 1 HFRS patient from
the same region. Nucleotide diversity of sequences belonging to the DOBV–Kurkino genotype
was only 1.3%, with no diversity on the deduced amino acid level (Figure 2).
2.5. Phylogenetic Analysis of S and M Segment Sequences
To confirm hantavirus phylogenetic diversity, observed in the L segment, we further analysed
S and M segment sequences. The phylogenetic analysis of 306 bp long S segment sequence from
119 samples, 55 rodents and 64 patients confirmed the presence of five hantavirus genotypes in
Viruses 2013, 5 3076
Slovenia (Figure 3). Nucleotide diversity was smaller than on the L segment (Figure 2), but still
SWSV (11.6%) and TULV (13.1%) have the largest nucleotide divergence observed. PUUV S
segment sequences were obtained from 44 samples (9 voles and 35 patients), with diversity of
8.9% on the nucleotide level and up to 2% on the deduced amino acid level. All three
phylogenetic lineages identified on the L segment sequences were confirmed (Figure 3).
DOBV S segment sequences were obtained from 55 samples (27 mice and 28 patients) and
the presence of three phylogenetic lineages was confirmed. Nucleotide diversity between DOBV
lineages was only 6.5%. Again, the smallest divergence was seen in the DOBV–Kurkino
genotype (0.7%), where we successfully obtained sequences from seven mice and one patient
sample.
Further on, we obtained 67 partial M segment sequences (134 bp) from 41 rodent and 26
patient samples. We were unsuccessful in amplifying the M segment from TULV carriers and
the patient infected with the DOBV–Kurkino genotype. Due to the lower number of available
sequences, we confirmed the presence of two phylogenetic lineages within PUUV, three lineages
within DOBV and two SWSV genetic lineages (Figure 3). The largest divergence was observed
within SWSV sequences (16.3%), whilst the smallest divergence was seen in the DOBV–
Kurkino genotype (1.9%) (Figure 3).

obtained sequences from small mammals and patients, as well as pairwise nucleotide (nt)
and deduced amino acid (aa) distances. Dots indicate sequences that could not be assigned
to any phylogenetic lineage determined in the L segment analysis.

2.6. Phylogeographic Analysis
The PUUV and DOBV L segments were used for phylogeographic analyses due to the
greatest number of acquired sequences. As seen in Figure 4, three PUUV phylogenetic lineages,
designated P1–P3, are related to the geographical origin of sequences obtained from PUUV
patients and hosts [7]. The first PUUV lineage (P1) is localized in the Prealpine region and the
second lineage (P2) was determined mainly in patients from the Dinaric and Submediterranean
regions. The majority of patients and animals infected with PUUV from lineage P3 can be found
in the Subpannonian zoogeographic region Statistically significant differences were confirmed in
the distribution of specific phylogenetic lineages within zoogeographic regions (χ2
, p < 0.0001).
Sequences obtained from bank voles and PUUV-infected patients mainly overlap and
geographically outlying sequences were all derived from patients.
Figure 4. Correlation of phylogenetic and geographical clustering based on PUUV L
segment sequences. Phylogeographic analysis showed the presence of three genetic
lineages (light blue—P1, dark blue—P2, pink—P3) in voles and patients. The
sequences obtained from patients are marked with a dot.
Phylogeographic analysis of DOBV revealed three phylogenetic lineages of the DOBV–
Dobrava and one lineage of the DOBV–Kurkino genotype. Distribution of specific phylogenetic
lineages was correlated with zoogeographic regions (χ2
, p < 0.0001). In the Subpannonian
region, both DOBV lineage D1 and DOBV–Kurkino are sympatric in hosts and patients.
Moreover, the DOBV–Kurkino sequence obtained from a patient clusters together with the
sequences from striped field mice. Lineage DOBV D1 is circulating in a geographically limited
focal area, from which patients are rarely reported. However, one sequence from lineage D1 was
obtained from a patient resident in the central part of Slovenia. Phylogenetic lineages D2 and D3
show a clear geographical clustering, where sequences from mice and patients mainly overlap.
Viruses 2013, 5 3079
Sequences from the lineage D2 are located in the Dinaric region, where DOBV was isolated for
the first time and where the most severe cases of HFRS are reported. The third, the D3 lineage, is
mostly found in the Prealpine and Submediterranean regions (Figure 5).
Figure 5. Correlation of phylogenetic and geographical clustering based on sequence
of DOBV L segment. Phylogeographic analysis showed the presence of three genetic
lineages of DOBV–Dobrava (violet—D1, pink—D2, orange—D3) and DOBV–
Kurkino genotype in mice and patients. The sequences obtained from patients are
marked with a dot.
3. Experimental Section
3.1. Trapping of Small Mammals and Patient Sample Collection
Small mammals had been trapped in spring and autumn, in different locations in Slovenia
since 1990. Study sites were selected with regard to data on reported HFRS cases. Sherman
(Tallahassee, FL, USA) and Elliot-type (Upwey, Australia) live traps were used for the trapping
of small mammals. All captured animals were identified, weighed, measured and then
anesthetized. Internal organs (heart, lungs, liver, spleen, kidneys and urine bladder) were
collected and stored in cryovials at −80 °C. Blood was collected by cardiac puncture and
centrifuged for 5 min at 2,000 rpm. Serum was separated from the blood clot and both were
stored in cryovials at −20 °C. Each caught animal was identified by a professional taxonomist
and additionally confirmed by sequencing of cytochrome b as a phylogenetic marker (data
available upon request).
Patient samples were received for HFRS testing from several Slovenian hospitals from
1985–2012. Blood was centrifuged for 5 min at 2,000 rpm. Serum was separated from the
blood clot and stored at −20 °C. Clinical diagnosis was confirmed serologically by an indirect
immunofluorescence assay and by enzyme-linked immunoassay IgM and IgG tests [3].

3.2. DNA and RNA Extraction
Total DNA was extracted by QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands) from
animal lung samples, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA was extracted by
TRIZOL Reagent (Invitrogen, Life TechnologiesTM
, Carlsbad, NM, USA) from animal kidney
samples, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For total RNA extraction from human
serum samples, QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands) was used, as
described by the manufacturer.
3.3. Screening with Multiplex Real-Time RT-PCR for DOBV and PUUV
For screening of all human and animal samples from Apodemus sp. and M. glareolus
multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay specific for Slovenian DOBV and PUUV was used. Multiplex
real-time RT-PCR assay targeting DOBV M segment (97 bp) and PUUV S segment (186 bp)
was performed using primers DOB D (ACTTTAAGACAACCAATA), DOB L

(ACATCATTTGAGGACAT) and probes DOB S (FAM-TTCCATGGCTGGGCAACTGCT-DB)
and PUU S (JOE-TTCATGCCAACAGCCCAGTCAAC-DB). Real-time RT-PCR conditions
were established for ABI7500 series (Applied Biosystems, Life TechnologiesTM
, Carlsbad, NM,
USA) with temperature protocol 50 °C for 5 min, 95 °C for 20 s and 45 cycles consisting of
95 °C for 3 s, 55 °C for 30 s and 60 °C for 30 s. Taq Man®

3.4. Screening with Hantavirus Universal RT-PCR
For hantavirus screening broad spectrum, nested RT-PCR with degenerated primers HAN-L-
F1, HAN-L-R1, HAN-L-F2, HAN-L-R2 targeting L segment (band size 390 bp) were used [9].
For positive samples additionally S and M segments were obtained.

For DOBV–Kurkino S segment (band size 1051 bp) from animal samples DOBV primers
(DOB-SF2, DOB-SR, MS120C, MS1170R) were used. For patient samples, additional outer
primers DOBS1 and DOBS2, as well as inner primers DOBS3 and DOBS4 (428 bp) were used
[4]. To obtain DOBV–Kurkino M segment (band size 290 bp), previously published primers

used as previously described [7].
3.6. Phylogenetic Analysis
All positive samples were sequenced with the ABI3500 Genetic Analyzer (Applied
Biosystems, Life TechnologiesTM
, Carlsbad, NM, USA). The obtained nucleotide sequences
were analysed with CLC Main Workbench software, version 6.1 (CLC bio, Aarhus, Denmark).
Sequence alignments were performed using the Muscle algorithm in MEGA version 5 [15].
Nucleotide substitution model (HKY + G) was selected based on Akaike’s information criterion
(AIC) in jModelTest, version 0.1.1 [16]. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis was performed in
MrBayes 3.2 [17] and Tracer version 1.5 [18]. Three independent MCMC runs of four chains
Viruses 2013, 5 3082
each consisting of 10,000,000 generations were run to ensure effective sample sizes (ASS) of at
least 200. Maximum clade credibility trees were depicted using FigTree version 1.3.1 [18].
Representative sequences of the hantavirus strains described in the study were deposited in
GenBank (KF776554–KF776735, KF776736–KF776792, KF776793–KF776905).
3.7. Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 21.0. The
relationship between phylogenetic clustering and zoogeographic regions was calculated using the
χ2
test.
4. Conclusions
Slovenia lies at a junction of the Alps, the Mediterranean, the Pannonian basin and the
Dinaric Mountains. The resulting high biotic and landscape diversity form the foundation for
great variability of zoonotic pathogens, in our case the hantaviruses [8]. Thirty-one species of
small mammals can be found in Slovenia [19,20]. These species occupy different habitats and
also vary in their dietary preferences. Periodic fluctuation in rodent numbers is well recognized
and several hypotheses have been offered to explain the pattern of inter-annual variation, from
food availability to specialist predators or intrinsic factors [21]. Several species have been
confirmed to harbour pathogenic (DOBV,DOBV–Kurkino and PUUV) and non-pathogenic
(TULV and SWSV) hantaviruses [2,4–7,22]. DOBV and PUUV patients are confirmed annually
in Slovenian HFRS-endemic regions, with a three-fold higher incidence of PUUV compared to
DOBV. In the present study, we have genetically defined hantaviruses from one-fifth of
Slovenian HFRS patients. Among them, the first patient with DOBV–Kurkino infection was
discovered. Furthermore, several lineages have been recognized for each hantavirus species in
Slovenia. The diversity within different hantavirus species ranges from 1.3% for DOBV–
Kurkino lineages up to 14.1% for the SWSV (Figure 2). On average, higher nucleotide diversity
was observed in non-pathogenic hantaviruses, whereby DOBV and PUUV seem to be more
conserved, and with stronger geographical clustering. While no geographical clustering was
observed for SWSV and two different phylogenetic lineages were simultaneously present in one
sampling location, PUUV sequences cluster into three lineages, which are grouped in
geographically limited areas (Figure 4). There is some overlap in the border areas between
regions, where several genetic lineages are circulating. In comparison to previous studies, an
additional genetic lineage (P1) of PUUV has been established in the Prealpine region, which has
been severely affected during the last HFRS outbreak. Prior to the 2012 outbreak, only one
PUUV RNA sequence obtained from a bank vole indicated the existence of this lineage and the
endemic area. The regions where PUUV is established are rich in broad-leaved forests, which are
favoured by PUUV rodent hosts. Bank voles prefer lowland forest habitats (plenty of beech and
spruce), with major water flows in the vicinity. The genetic variability of the species has not
been studied yet, but some variability in the species is recognized according to phenotype
characteristics. The western part of the country, the Alpine and Dinaric regions, are settled by a
bigger subspecies, most likely M. glareolus gorka, whereas the animals found in the
Viruses 2013, 5 3083
Subpannonian region are somewhat smaller, though their subspecies is as of yet not recognized
[20]. No connection can therefore be made between the subspecies distribution and the genetic
variability of PUUV. A similarity can be observed in clustering of DOBV–Dobrava where again
an overlap of several genetic lineages was observed in the border areas. Since most of the HFRS
patients are infected in the vicinity of their home [4,5], the patient’s residence was used as a
sequence geographic origin. The majority of patient sequences in the present study matched the
host-derived sequences in the area, a fact which is therefore a good indicator that the infection
originates locally, close to the patient’s home. Nevertheless, in the pyhlogeographic analysis of
DOBV and PUUV, some outliers were present, which are derived from patient samples (Figures
4 and 5). These patients were most likely infected outside of their local residence area; for
example, during a vacation in a different region in Slovenia. An additional exception is a cluster
of D3 lineage sequences, which have been detected in both mice and a patient in a limited, focal
area in the Dinaric region, where the D2 lineage is prominent (Figure 5). In this focal area, it
appears that both lineages circulate in rodents and occasionally patients are infected with either
one or the other DOBV lineage. Although DOBV and PUUV are present in the majority of the
country, the sequence diversity among DOBV lineages is lower in comparison to PUUV. The
host, A. flavicollis, can be found all over Slovenia, but prefers dry and warm broad-leafed
forests, especially in the Dinaric region. Variability of the species is low, and the animals
probably belong to a single subspecies [20]. Additionally, the DOBV–Kurkino genotype has
been confirmed both in a patient and striped field mice in the Subpannonian region. A. agrarius
has a limited geographic range of distribution in Slovenia, and can be found only in parts of the
Subpannonian region, a small area between the Subpannonian and Dinaric regions. An isolated
population also exists in a restricted area in the Submediterranean region.
Hantavirus species are associated with a single rodent species in which they establish
persistent infection [23]. DOBV and PUUV are both harboured by generalist rodent species,
which can be found all over Slovenia. They are highly adaptable and able to adjust to almost any
environment and may often survive habitat disturbances or even benefit from them. Both viruses
can therefore be confirmed in a major part of the country. Contrary to these are the TULV,
SWSV and DOBV–Kurkino genotypes. The Microtus voles, insectivores and the striped field
mouse, which harbour these viruses, are specialist species. They are often significantly limited
by the environment, due to their special dietary and habitat needs. Since their numbers are
usually lower and there is less chance of exposure to humans, the human cases are less common.
Both TULV and SWSV are probably not human pathogens and they have a high degree of
nucleotide sequence divergence, which is often associated with hantaviruses in specialist species
[24,25].
Due to the tectonic formation of particular areas and natural isolating barriers, climatic change
and complex abiotic and biotic factors in a specific area, certain patterns of species distribution
have been formed in Slovenia. These factors are included in the formation of the aforementioned
zoogeographic regions designed by Mršić [8]. In our case, the influence of these factors is seen
on the example of the species-specific hantaviruses. It is presumed that geographic barriers and
the features of the zoogeographic area limit not only the virus host, but consequently also the
virus, which can be found only within the limits (which are not always very strict) of specific

zoogeographic areas. Within the zoogeographic regions, there are specific areas where
hantavirus infections have been confirmed in the rodents and where human infections are most
prevalent. These areas are most commonly associated with major water bodies in Slovenia, most
often the major rivers (Figure 1). Most cities and villages in Slovenia are located close to the
river systems, that is, the areas of highest diversity and species richness, which could thus
explain why the majority of human cases appear in these regions. It is presumed that the
combination of factors in endemic areas is such that it ensures a rodent population density which
is above the threshold sufficient to ensure infection of the reservoir [26]. In years with a peak in
rodent population, this threshold is achieved in a large part of the country, and hence the
endemic regions seemingly explode due to dispersal of rodents from high-quality patches [27].
Still, geographic barriers seem to limit the spread of specific virus lineage and its host.
This study, which consists of one of the largest collections of hantaviral sequences to date,
has shown a very high hantavirus diversity in a small area. It is evident that the distribution of
the virus is mainly influenced by the presence of the host species, but the geographic
characteristics impact and limit the formation of endemic areas. Specific features of a
zoogeographic region should be analysed individually in order to recognize the most important
factors influencing the hantavirus distribution. Previous studies recognized the importance of
precipitation and landscape features (vegetation and soil variables) [27–32], which either
influence the host ecology or intrinsic factors influencing virus transmission. Also, human
influence should not be neglected in studies of endemic regions of hantaviruses. Previous studies
confirmed that anthropogenic-disturbed land cover is associated with exposure of rodents to
hantaviruses as well as the distribution and abundance of rodent species [33,34]. In the ever-
changing environment, both in Slovenia and throughout the world, excellent knowledge of the
variability of the hantavirus species, the recognition of endemic areas and important factors
influencing those areas is essential. Such knowledge will enable us to make predictions of
changes in disease risk in the future and consequently facilitate targeted intervention measures.
