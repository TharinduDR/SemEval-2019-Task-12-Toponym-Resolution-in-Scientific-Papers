Abstract
Three species of Myodes voles known to harbor hantaviruses include the bank vole (Myodes
glareolus), which serves as the reservoir host of Puumala virus (PUUV), the prototype arvicolid
rodent-borne hantavirus causing hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Europe, and
the grey red-backed vole (M. rufocanus) and royal vole (M. regulus) which carry two PUUV-like
hantaviruses, designated Hokkaido virus (HOKV) and Muju virus (MUJV), respectively. To
ascertain the hantavirus harbored by the northern red-backed vole (M. rutilus), we initially
screened sera from 233 M. rutilus, as well as from 90 M. rufocanus and 110 M. glareolus,
captured in Western and Eastern Siberia during June 2007 to October 2009, for anti-hantaviral
antibodies. Thereafter, lung tissues from 44 seropositive voles were analyzed for hantavirus RNA
by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Partial L-, M- and S-segment sequences,
detected in M. rutilus and M. rufocanus, were closely related to HOKV, differing from previously
published L-, M- and S-segment sequences of HOKV by 17.8–20.2%, 15.9–23.4% and 15.0–
17.0% at the nucleotide level and 2.6–7.9%, 1.3–6.3% and 1.2–4.0% at the amino acid level,
respectively. Alignment and comparison of hantavirus sequences from M. glareolus trapped in
Tiumen Oblast showed very high sequence similarity to the Omsk lineage of PUUV. Phylogenetic
analysis, using neighbor-joining, maximal likelihood and Bayesian methods, showed that HOKV
strains shared a common ancestry with PUUV and exhibited geographic-specific clustering. This

1. Introduction
Hantaviruses (family Bunyaviridae, genus Hantavirus) possess a negative-sense, single-
stranded, tripartite RNA genome, comprising L, M and S segments, which encode an RNA-
dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), envelope glycoproteins (Gn and Gc) and nucleocapsid
(N protein), respectively (Plyusnin et al., 1996). Several hantaviruses, harbored by rodents
(order Rodentia) belonging to the Muridae and Cricetidae families, cause hemorrhagic fever
with renal syndrome (HFRS) (Jonsson et al., 2010). Hantaan virus (HTNV), Dobrava-
Belgrade virus (DOBV) and Seoul virus (SEOV) are the principal pathogenic murid rodent-
borne hantaviruses, while Puumala virus (PUUV), carried by the bank vole (Myodes
glareolus), is the prototype HFRS-causing arvicolid rodent-borne hantavirus.
M. glareolus is one of the most abundant and widely distributed small mammal species in
Europe, occurring in most areas except near the coast of the Mediterranean Basin and in the
far northern territories (Olsson et al., 2010). In the Asian part of the continent, its range
extends to the Sayan Mountains and northern Kazakhstan (Shenbrot and Krasnov, 2005).
Following the latest glacial period, M. glareolus recolonized the continent and formed at
least eight distinct lineages of co-evolved PUUV (Sironen et al., 2001). Phylogenetic studies
suggest that the Omsk lineage of PUUV in western Siberia has a common evolutionary
origin with that of the Finnish lineage (Dekonenko et al., 2003).
Three other species of Myodes voles serve as reservoir hosts of hantaviruses: the grey red-
backed vole (M. rufocanus), northern red-backed vole (M. rutilus) and royal vole (M.
regulus). The former two species have overlapping geographic ranges with M. glareolus in
Europe and Asia (Shenbrot and Krasnov, 2005). In particular, M. rufocanus is distributed in
the northern Paleoarctic, extending from northern Fennoscandia through northern Russia to
Kamchatka, northeastern and northern Korea, Mongolia, China, Sakhalin (Russia) and
Hokkaido (Japan), whereas M. rutilus is a Holarctic species found throughout northern
Europe, Asia, Alaska and Canada. By contrast, M. regulus is confined to mountainous
regions at elevations above 500 m in the Korean Peninsula (Kaneko, 1990).
Hantaviral antigens were initially detected in M. rufocanus in Far East and Siberian Russia
(Kosoy et al., 1997; Tkachenko et al., 1983, 1987). Subsequently, genetic evidence of a
PUUV-like hantavirus, designated Hokkaido virus (HOKV), was demonstrated in M.
rufocanus trapped in Hokkaido, Japan (Kariwa et al., 1995, 1999; Sanada et al., 2012), the
Far East region and Buryatia Republic of Russia (Plyusnina et al., 2008; Yashina et al., 2004,
2013) and Jilin province, China (Zhang et al., 2007). Another PUUV-like virus, named Muju
virus (MUJV), was detected in M. regulus, trapped at multiple sites in the Republic of Korea

(Lee et al., 2014; Song et al., 2007). Both HOKV and MUJV share a common ancestry with
PUUV.
Although hantaviral antigens or antibodies have been reported in M. rutilus, captured in
Alaska (Lee et al., 1982) and in European, Siberian and Far East Russia (Kosoy et al., 1997;
Tkachenko et al., 1987; Yashina et al., 2012), the hantavirus harbored by M. rutilus has not
been characterized. In the present study, genetic analysis of hantaviruses in M. rutilus, M.
rufocanus and M. glareolus, sharing the same ecological habitats in the Western Siberia,
indicates that both M. rutilus and M. rufocanus serve as reservoir hosts of HOKV. Based on
whole genome sequence analysis of MUJV (Lee et al., 2014) and findings from this
investigation, HOKV and MUJV appear to represent genetic variants, or genotypes, of
PUUV, rather than distinct hantavirus species. We, therefore, tentatively propose that HOKV
and MUJV be called the Hokkaido and Muju genotypes of PUUV.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Rodent trapping and screening
During June 2007 to October 2009, rodents were captured in 12 forest localities of seven
administrative regions of Western and Eastern Siberia (Altai Republic, Altai and
Krasnoyarsk Krais, and Tiumen, Omsk, Kemerovo and Tomsk Oblasts), where two or three
Myodes species were sympatric (Table 1 and Fig. 1). Captured Myodes voles were identified
according to a complex of morphologic criteria, including configuration of the prisms and
triangles of the occlusal surface of the third upper (M3) and first lower (M1) molars, body
size, length and hairiness of tail, and fur coloration (Gromov and Erbaeva, 1995; Gromov
and Polyakov, 1977). Sera and lung tissues were stored in liquid nitrogen for subsequent
analysis for anti-hantavirus antibodies by the indirect immunofluorescent antibody test (IFA)
using Vero E6 cells infected with HTNV (76–118), PUUV (CG1820) and SEOV (SR-11) as
antigens (Dzagurova et al., 1995), and for hantavirus RNA by reverse transcription-
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (Yashina et al., 2004, 2013). Although hantaviral
antigens have been detected before antibody responses in M. glareolus experimentally
infected with PUUV (Apekina et al., 2014), we were unable to test all tissues from wild-
trapped Myodes voles by RT-PCR, due to budgetary constraints, and instead were able to
test tissues only from IFA-seropositive voles.
2.2. Ethics statement
All trapping and handling of rodents and processing of their tissues were performed
according to well-established protocols (Mills et al., 1995), approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of the State Research Center of Virology and
Biotechnology “Vector”.
2.3. RT-PCR, mtDNA and DNA sequencing
Total RNA was extracted from lung tissue of anti-hantaviral antibody-positive rodents with
the RNeasy MiniKit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and cDNA was synthesized using Expand
reverse transcriptase (Roche) and universal primer 5′-TAGTAGTAGACTCC-3′. Four sets of
nested primers were used to amplify selected regions of the large (L: positions 180–522),

medium (M: 2764–3004) and small (S: 43–1251) segments (nucleotide position numbers are
those for PUUV strain CG1820: GenBank M63194, M29979, M32750). Sequences of
primers are shown in Table 2. To confirm the taxonomic identity of hantavirus RNA-positive
voles, genomic DNA was extracted from frozen lung tissue using the QIAamp DNA Mini
Kit (Qiagen), and the partial 426-nucleotide region of the cytochrome b gene of
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was amplified by PCR using previously described universal
primers: +14115 (5′-CGAAGCTTGATATGAAAAACCATCGTTG-3′); and −14532 (5′-
GCAGCCCCTCAGAATGATATTTGTCCAC-3′) (Smith & Patton, 1991). Amplicons were
gel-purified with QIAquick Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen) and directly sequenced using ABI
Prizm BigDye Terminator kit (PE Applied Biosystem) and an automatic ABI Prism 310
genetic analyzer.
2.4. Genetic and phylogenetic analyses
Pair-wise alignment and comparison of newfound hantavirus nucleotide sequences were
performed using ClustalW (Thompson et al., 1994). The distance-based neighbor-joining
method, supported by MEGA 5.1 (Tamura et al., 2011), was used to construct phylogenetic
trees, which were evaluated by bootstrap analysis of 1,000 neighbor-joining iterations. In
addition, unrooted phylogenetic trees were generated by maximum likelihood and Bayesian
methods, implemented in PAUP* (Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony, 4.0b10)
(Swofford, 2003), RAxML Blackbox webserver (Stamatakis et al., 2008) and MrBayes 3.1
(Ronquist and Huelsenbeck, 2003), under the best-fit GTR+I+Γ model of evolution selected
by hierarchical likelihood-ratio test in MrModeltest v2.3 (Posada and Crandall, 1998) and
jModelTest version 0.1 (Posada, 2008). Two replicate Bayesian Metropolis–Hastings
Markov Chain Monte Carlo runs, each comprising six chains of 10 million generations
sampled every 100 generations with a burn-in of 25,000 (25%), resulted in 150,000 trees
overall. Each genomic segment (S, M and L) was treated separately in phylogenetic
analyses. The posterior node probabilities were based on 2 million generations and estimated
sample sizes over 100 (implemented in MrBayes).
3. Results
M. rutilus was the dominant Myodes species captured at six sites, M. rufocanus at three and
M. glareolus at two, with equal numbers of M. rutilus and M. glareolus at one site (Omsk
Oblast) (Table 1). Sera, diluted 1:10, from 433 voles (233 M. rutilus, 90 M. rufocanus and
110 M. glareolus) were initially screened by IFA for the presence of anti-hantaviral
antibodies. Individuals of one, two or three Myodes species in 11 of the 12 trap sites were
anti-hantavirus antibody positive (Table 1).
Of the 44 (10.2%) seropositive voles, hantavirus RNA was detected in two of 17 M. rutilus,
two of 19 M. rufocanus and three of eight M. glareolus, which were taxonomically verified
by mitochondrial DNA analysis. Sequence analysis, based on a 426-nucleotide cytochrome b
region of mtDNA, showed that intraspecies differences in Myodes voles (M. glareolus, M.
rufocanus and M. rutilus) varied from 0 to 2.3%, while interspecies differences were from
6.8–9.6%. In all studied cases, cytochrome b typing matched morphological specification of

hantavirus RNA-positive Myodes voles. The GenBank accession numbers for the
cytochrome b sequences are provided in Table 3.
Hantavirus RNA-positive voles were captured in three localities of the Altai region: near
Teletskoye Lake (Artybash village, Altai Republic), Pokrovka and Solton villages (Altai
Krai) and in one locality of Tiumen Oblast near Kuchuk Lake (Table 1 and Fig. 1). In one of
these sites (Teletskoye Lake), hantavirus RNA was detected in two of three hantavirus-
infected Myodes species (M. rutilus and M. rufocanus), and in each of three other sites
hantavirus sequences from a single host species were identified.
Hantavirus RNA was detected in lung tissues from seven of 44 anti-hantaviral antibody-
positive Myodes voles. Of these, six voles had anti-hantavirus antibody titers ≥1:80 (Table
4). Six of 17 voles with antibody titers ≥1:80 were hantavirus RNA positive, compared to
one of 27 voles with anti-hantaviral antibody titers ≤1:40. At titers of ≥1:320, four of five
voles were hantavirus RNA positive (Table 4).
Analysis of partial L- (position 180–522), M- (position 2764–3004) and S- (position 43–
1251) segment sequences from M. rutilus and M. rufocanus showed that both species
harbored a hantavirus which was most closely related to HOKV. HOKV was detected in M.
rutilus in Solton, in M. rufocanus in Pokrovka and in both M. rutilus and M. rufocanus in
Teletskoye Lake (Table 1). In both Solton and Teletskoye Lake, M. rutilus was the dominant
species, accounting for 53.8% and 86.0% of all captured Myodes voles, respectively.
The nucleotide sequence similarity among the newly identified HOKV strains
Teletskoye854/Mrt, Teletskoye937/Mrf, Solton35/Mrt and Pokrovka674/Mrf were 83.6–
97.7%, 80.5–98.8% and 84.5–97.6% for the L-, M- and S-segments, respectively. And the
deduced amino acid sequence similarity was 99.1–100% for the RdRp, 98.8–100% for the
Gc glycoprotein and 97.3–99.3% for the N protein. Minimal nucleotide sequence divergence
(<3%) was shown for HOKV strains, Teletskoye854/Mrt and Teletskoye937/Mrf detected in
M. rutilus and M. rufocanus, respectively, from one locality. Compared with previously
published HOKV L-, M- and S-segment sequences from M. rufocanus, 79.8–82.2%, 76.6–
84.1% and 83.0–85.0% similarity was found at the nucleotide level and 92.1–97.4%, 93.7–
98.7% and 96.0–98.8% at the amino acid level. The amino acid sequences of the RdRp, Gc
and N proteins of the Siberian HOKV strains differed from that of PUUV strains by 6.1–
9.7%, 5.0–6.3% and 3.5–4.5%, and from that of MUJV strains by 9.7–10.5%, 5.0–6.3% and
4.2–6.0%.
Hantavirus RNA, detected in three of four seropositive M. glareolus in Tiumen Oblast
(Kuchuk170/Mg, Kuchuk197/Mg, Kuchuk246/Mg), showed the highest degree of sequence
similarity to the Omsk lineage of PUUV, previously described in M. glareolus captured in a
neighboring administrative region of Siberia (Omsk Oblast): 93.3–96.7% and 97.5% for M
and 96.6–96.9% and 98.5–99.2% for S segment at the nucleotide and amino acid levels,
respectively. Compared with other PUUV strains, Kuchuk170/Mg, Kuchuk197/Mg and
Kuchuk246/Mg differed by 14.5–19.6% at the nucleotide level and 1.8–6.1% at the amino
acid level for the L segment, and by 14.1–17.4% and 3.7–8.7% for the M segment, and by
11.2–17.4% and 1.7–4.7% for the S segment, respectively. The partial amino acid sequences

of the Siberian HOKV strains differed from that of the Siberian PUUV strains by 6.1–7.9%
for RdRp, 6.2–7.5% for Gc and 3.7–5.0% for N protein.
Phylogenetic trees based on partial S-, M- and L-segment sequences, using neighbor-joining,
maximum-likelihood and Bayesian methods, indicated that HOKV strains were placed
within the well-supported clade formed by three hantaviruses associated with Myodes voles:
PUUV, HOKV and MUJV (Fig. 2). HOKV strains formed five genetic lineages, represented
respectively by previously described strains from Japan (Kamiiso-8Cr-95, Tobetsu60Cr,
Kiritappu126S, Nakagawa49S, Ishikari9S) and Russia (Sakhalin99S), Republic Buryatia
(Mukhorshibir767, Tunka227), Russia-China (Fusong and Khekhtsir3S) and two new
lineages from Russia: Siberia 1 (Solton35/Mrt, Teletskoye854/Mrt, Olhon109/Mrf) and
Siberia 2 (Pokrovka674/Mrf). The N protein sequence of the newfound HOKV strains
contained specific amino acid signatures of HOKV (Val/Ile68, Val/Ala79 and Ile262) and
residues common for all HOKV strains and those also shared by MUJV, Khabarovsk virus
(KBRV) and Topografov virus (TOPV) (Arg26, Pro283). Specific amino acid signatures for
the Siberia 1 lineage were Met127, Asp302 and Asp307, and for the Siberia 2 lineage
Gln237.
The Siberia 1 lineage of HOKV included three new strains from the Altai region (Solton35,
Teletskoye854, Teletskoye937) and the previously described strain Olhon109 from M.
rufocanus captured in Olhon district of Irkutsk Oblast (Yashina et al., 2013), located more
then 1,750 km to the east, near Baikal Lake. The Siberia 2 lineage was found in M.
rufocanus captured at one site near Pokrovka village (Altai Krai), located approximately 260
km southwest from the two other sites, Teletskoye Lake and Solton. The newly identified
PUUV strain Kuchuk170 from M. glareolus was placed within the Omsk lineage of PUUV,
according to geography.
4. Discussion
The principal objectives of this study were to determine the molecular phylogeny of
hantaviruses harbored by three species of Myodes voles inhabiting the same natural foci in
Western and Eastern Siberia and to fill a long-standing gap in knowledge about the
hantavirus harbored by M. rutilus. This report provides the first genetic evidence that HOKV
is harbored by both M. rufocanus and M. rutilus in Siberian Russia. That HOKV was found
irrespective of whether the dominant Myodes species was M. rutilus (Teletskoye Lake and
Solton) or M. rufocanus (Pokrovka) suggests that both species are natural reservoirs of
HOKV.
Host-specificity studies of experimental PUUV infection in wild-trapped and colonized
cricetid rodents (Klingström et al., 2002) are compatible with our finding of HOKV RNA in
lung tissues of two species of anti-hantaviral antibody-positive, wild-trapped voles, M.
rufocanus and M. rutilus. Because M. rutilus was the dominant Myodes species over M.
rufocanus in Solton and Teletskoye Lake, spillover infection of HOKV from the latter to the
former is unlikely.

Overall, hantavirus RNA was detected in only 15.9% (7/44) of the anti-hantaviral antibody-
positive Myodes voles. The discordance between the prevalence of anti-hantaviral antibody
and hantavirus RNA was most striking in M. rufocanus (2/19, or 10.5%) and M. rutilus (2/17
or 11.8%), compared to M. glareolus (3/8, or 37.5%) (Tables 1 and 4). However, this
discrepancy may have been artificially accentuated by including 12 voles (6 M. rutilus, 4 M.
rufocanus and 2 M. glareolus) with anti-hantaviral antibody titers of ≤1:20. That is,
hantavirus RNA was more commonly detected in voles with antibody titers ≥1:80 (6/17, or
35.3%) or ≥160 (5/8, or 62.5%), which is consistent with experimental PUUV infection
studies, which showed that 48% of voles with high levels of antibodies correlated with
PUUV antigen in lung tissues (Apekina et al., 2014).
A possible reason for the low success rate of detecting hantavirus RNA in seropositive voles
include the insufficiently sensitive RT-PCR assay; that is, although the L-segment
oligonucleotide primers were broadly cross reactive and have been successfully employed
for gene amplification of KBRV in Microtus maximowiczii, Vladivostok virus (VLAV) in
Microtus fortis and Tula virus (TULV) in Microtus arvalis, the most reasonable explanation
for the low RT-PCR positivity in lung tissues among antibody-positive M. rufocanus and M.
rutilus was the lower viral load, which was beyond the limits of detection. Few studies have
compared two of these hantaviral markers in M. rufocanus. For example, only 5 of 8
seropositive wild Microtus and Myodes voles were RT-PCR positive (Plyusnina et al., 2008).
Another possible reason for the discrepancy is that HOKV infection may be less robust and
persistent in M. rutilus and M. rufocanus, resulting in lower viral copy numbers, compared
to PUUV infection in M. glareolus. Thus, while 75% (3/4) of seropositive M. glareolus from
Kuchuk was PUUV RNA positive, only 12.5% (1/8) of seropositive M. rufocanus and 16.7%
(1/6) M. rutilus were HOKV RNA positive in Pokrovka and Teletskoye Lake, respectively.
By contrast, passively acquired maternal antibodies cannot explain the anti-hantaviral
antibody prevalence, because all of the captured voles were subadults and adults. Equally
unlikely is the occurrence of spillover and the failure to capture another arvicolid rodent
species that represents the reservoir host of HOKV. Only two or three species of Myodes
voles, which are potential reservoirs of PUUV and PUU-like virus, inhabit the studied
territory and all of these species were trapped and analyzed. No other Myodes species are
described in Siberia.
We were unable to detect PUUV in one seropositive M. glareolus captured in Teletskoye
Lake, where HOKV was found in seropositive M. rutilus and M. rufocanus. Similarly, in the
trapping site of Kuchuk in Tiumen Oblast, where PUUV was detected in the dominant M.
glareolus, we failed to find HOKV in one seropositive M. rutilus. These results are
consistent with that of previous studies, indicating hantavirus antigen in M. glareolus and M.
rutilus within the same natural focus, where M. glareolus was the dominant species
(Myasnikov et al., 1992).
Geographic-specific clustering within distinct genetic lineages has been recognized for
arvicolid rodent-borne hantaviruses, such as PUUV (Plyusnin et al., 1995; Sironen et al.,
2001), MUJV (Lee et al., 2014; Song et al., 2007) and TULV (Song et al., 2004; Tkachenko

et al., 2015). Available data on PUUV support the hypothesis that the phylogeography of
different lineages was formed by separate post-glacial migrations of M. glareolus (Asikainen
et al., 2000). We suggest a similar basis for the distribution pattern of distinct lineages of
HOKV. Previously, it was shown that the vast territory of European and Asian Russia,
including the southern regions of Siberia, was colonized by the same haplogroup of M.
rufocanus (Abramson et al., 2012). In accordance with these data, we found genetically
closely related HOKV strains of Siberia 1 lineage in the geographically distant Altai region
and Baikal Lake area (Teletskoye854/Mrt, Teletskoye937/Mrf, Solton35/Mrt and Olhon109).
Geographically close but genetically distant Siberia 2 and Siberia 1 lineages were found in
the mountainous area of the Altai region, suggesting that the two lineages are associated
with different colonization events of M. rufocanus, which had long periods of isolated
evolution.
Discovery of multiple newfound hantaviruses raises critical questions about their taxonomic
relationships (Lee et al., 2014; Maes et al., 2009) and evolutionary origins (Yanagihara et al.,
2014). Our data and results from other studies on the genetic diversity of PUUV, MUJV and
HOKV (Lee et al., 2014; Plyusnina et al., 2008; Sironen and Plyusnin, 2011; Zhang et al.,
2007) indicate that the current criterion of at least a 7% amino acid sequence difference in
both the complete N protein and GnGc, promulgated by the International Committee on the
Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) (Plyusnin et al., 2012), is not fulfilled to warrant separate
hantavirus species designation for PUUV, HOKV and MUJV. In this study, differences
between the N protein sequences (based on nearly the complete N protein, 402 of 433 amino
acids) of Siberian HOKV and PUUV strains were 4.8–6.0%. Recently, based on a thorough
genetic analysis of DOBV strains, a consortium of European hantavirus experts proposed
four genotypes: namely Dobrava, Saaremaa, Kurkino and Sochi (Klempa et al., 2013).
Similarly, analysis of publicly available sequences of hantaviruses harbored by Myodes
voles supports the concept of three PUUV genotypes: Puumala, Hokkaido and Muju.
Also, the ICTV criterion requiring a unique ecological niche of the reservoir host is invalid
for HOKV. M. rufocanus and M. rutilus, which belong to the same family (Cricetidae),
subfamily (Arvicolinae) and genus (Myodes) and which inhabit the same localities in
coniferous and broad-leaved forests of Siberian and Far East Russia, harbor HOKV. Thus,
this criterion might need to be revised to simply requiring that reservoir hosts belong to the
same genus.
Although approximately 7% of the human population in the Omsk region and 9% in the
Tiumen region have anti-hantaviral antibodies (Myasnikov et al., 1987), only low numbers
of HFRS cases have been registered in Western Siberia. Serological studies in the Altai
Republic and Altai Krai have also revealed anti-hantaviral antibody prevalence of
approximately 1–2% (Malkin et al., 1996). It is unclear if the rarity of HFRS in Siberia is
due to under-reporting or to the lower pathogenicity of HOKV. Future in-depth studies are
warranted to clarify if HOKV and MUJV, like PUUV, cause HFRS.

Phylogenetic trees, generated by the maximum-likelihood and Bayesian methods, using the
GTR+I+Γ model of evolution as estimated from the data, were based on the alignment of the
coding regions of the (S) partial S segment (position 43–1251), (M) partial M segment
(position 2764–3004) and (L) partial L segment (position 180–522) of Myodes vole-borne
hantaviruses and other representative hantaviruses. Because the unrooted phylogenetic trees
using these methods were very similar, the trees generated by MrBayes were displayed. The
phylogenetic positions of the newfound Myodes vole-borne hantaviruses from Siberia are
shown in relationship to PUUV CG215 (AF367066); PUUV CRF161 (AF367069,
