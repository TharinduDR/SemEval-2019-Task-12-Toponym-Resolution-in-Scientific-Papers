Abstract. To investigate arbovirus transmission in North Dakota, we collected and screened mosquitoes for viral
infection by Vero cell culture assay. Seven viruses were isolated from 13 mosquito species. Spatial and temporal distribu-
tions of the important vectors of West Nile virus (WNV), Cache Valley virus, Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV), and
trivittatus virus are reported. Snowshoe hare virus, Potosi virus, and western equine encephalomyelitis virus were also
isolated. The risks of Culex tarsalis and Aedes vexans transmitting WNV to humans were 61.4% and 34.0% in 2003–2006,
respectively, but in 2003 when the largest epidemic was reported, risks for Ae. vexans and Cx. tarsalis in Cass County were
73.6% and 23.9%, respectively. Risk of humans acquiring an infectious bite was greatest from about the second week of
July through most of August. West Nile virus sequences were of the WN02 genotype. Most JCV strains belonged to a single
clade of genetically related strains. Cache Valley virus and JCV were prevalent during August and early September and
during July and August, respectively.
INTRODUCTION
Five arboviruses have been reported from North Dakota
mosquitoes. Two of these viruses caused significant epidemics
and epizootics in humans and in horses. Western equine
encephalomyelitis virus (WEEV; Togaviridae: Alphavirus)
infected 1,180 humans and caused 96 deaths in 1941.1
Sixty-
one years later in 2002, West Nile virus (WNV; Flaviviridae:
Flavivirus) was introduced into North Dakota and caused
disease in 17 humans and 577 horses followed by 617 human
cases, five human deaths, and 42 equine cases during 2003.2
Since then, North Dakota has reported human WNV cases
every year and has one of the highest incidence rates of
neuroinvasive disease in the country.2,3
Other arboviruses
identified in North Dakota include St. Louis encephalitis virus
(SLEV; Flaviviridae: Flavivirus),4
Cache Valley virus (CVV;
Bunyaviridae: Orthobunyavirus),4
and trivittatus virus (TVTV;
Bunyaviridae: Orthobunyavirus).4
Jamestown Canyon virus
(JCV; Bunyaviridae: Orthobunyavirus), which has one of the
widest geographical ranges in North America of the California
serogroup of viruses, surprisingly, has previously not been docu-
mented in North Dakota.4
After the first report of WNV in North Dakota in 2002,2
we
established a mosquito and virus surveillance program in and
around the eastern city of Fargo (Cass County) and near the
town of Walcott (Richland County) in 2003–2005, and in the
northwestern city of Williston in 2004–2006 (Williams County)
(Figure 1). Additionally, collections were made for 3 days in
July 2003 in the rural town of Lakota (Nelson County). Our
objectives were to conduct an in-depth study of mosquitoes
and their viruses throughout the spring and summer in
selected locations in North Dakota. We report the isolation
of seven viruses from 13 species of mosquitoes, the spatial and
temporal distributions of the important vectors of the most
abundant arboviruses, the relative risk of mosquito vectors in
transmitting WNV to humans, the correlation of temporal
numbers of human cases of WNV with mosquito abundance
and infection rate, and a genetic analysis of WNV and JCV
isolates from different mosquito species, years of isolation,
and geographic locations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mosquito collections and identification. Trapping of
mosquitoes was done in Cass County in 2003–2005 and in
Williams County in 2004–2006 (Figure 1). Fargo (46°52¢38²N/
96°47¢21²W), a city of 110,000 people, is the county seat
in Cass County and is located on the western side of the
Red River, which runs along the North Dakota-Minnesota
border. Williston (48°08¢49²N/103°37¢05²W), a city of about
18,000 inhabitants, is the county seat in Williams County and
is situated along the Missouri River near the North Dakota-
Montana border. Mosquitoes were also collected in 2003 in
Nelson County in the vicinity of Lakota, the county seat.
Lakota (48°02²34²N/98°20¢10²W) is an agricultural commu-
nity with < 700 inhabitants and is located in the northwestern
portion of the county. Trapping in Lakota was discontinued
after 3 nights because of inability to consistently obtain dry
ice to supplement the traps. Mosquitoes were collected near
Walcott (46°32¢52²N/96°56¢19²W) in Richland County, which
is adjacent to the southern border of Cass County, in 2003–2005
(Figure 1). Trapping was carried out from July 4 to September
26, June 8 to October 6, May 24 to September 29, June 8 to
September 7 in 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006, respectively.
In 2003, five distinct trapping sites were established north-
east (two sites in Argusville, near the Sheyenne River
(47°03¢08²N/96°20¢10²W)) and southwest (three sites in Horace
(46°45¢32²N/96°54¢13²W) of Fargo and one site near Walcott.
Trapping was not done in Fargo because of an extensive mos-
quito control program initiated on the day traps were first
placed in the field. Traps were often placed weekly at each
location. Traps were set for 1 to 2 nights at 10 different loca-
tions near Lakota.
In 2004 and 2005, the same six trapping sites northeast and
southwest of Fargo were continued. Three additional sites
were established in Horace. Seven different geographically
different sites were established within the City of Fargo in
2004 and 2005.
In 2004–2006, mosquitoes were trapped at six different
locations immediately around Williston, ND. An additional
site was trapped in 2004 and 2005. Trapping was not done

within the city because of relatively frequent spraying of
insecticides for the control of mosquitoes.
Mosquitoes were collected with Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention (CDC) miniature light traps baited with
dry ice (model 512; John W. Hock Co., Gainesville, FL).5
Traps were placed about 0.9 m off the ground in the afternoon
or evening and collected the following morning. Mosquitoes
were knocked down in the field or laboratory with dry ice
or freezing temperatures, aspirated, and transferred into a
17
+
55 mm flat-bottomed shell vial that was sealed with a
rubber stopper. Three layers of water and gas-proof tape were
used to seal the juncture of the rubber stopper and vial. The
vial was appropriately labeled and immediately stored on dry
ice or in a −80°C freezer until packaged in dry ice within a
Styrofoam shipping container and sent by overnight mail to
The Connecticut Agriculture Experiment Station (CAES).
Mosquitoes were stored at CAES in a −80°C freezer until
processing. Extremely large collections were placed in 0.47 L
or 0.24 L Mason jars that were sealed with three layers of
water and gas-proof tape.
Mosquitoes were identified to species.6,7
Specimens were
placed on a cold platform and, with the aid of a dissecting
microscope, each specimen was identified. Mosquitoes were
placed into pools according to species, date, and trap location.
Pools contained from 1 to 50 mosquitoes. After identification
and pooling, mosquitoes were kept on regular ice until
attempted isolation of virus on the same day.
Virus isolation. Mosquitoes were ground in 0.5 to 1.25 mL
of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% gelatin,
30% rabbit serum, and 1% 100
+
antibiotic-antimycotic
(10,000 units mg/mL of streptomycin sulfate, and 25 mg/mL of
amphotericin B, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, in 0.85% saline).
Mosquitoes and saline were placed in a 2.5 mL plastic centri-
fuge vial containing a copper BB pellet. A Vibration Mill MM
300 (Retsch Laboratory, Irvine, CA) set at 30 cycles per sec-
ond and operated for 4 minutes was used inside a biosafety
hood to macerate mosquitoes.
After centrifugation at 4°C for 7 minutes at 520
+
g, a 100 mL
sample of supernatant was placed onto a monolayer of Vero
cells, growing in 4 mL of Minimum Essential Medium
containing fetal bovine serum, glutamine, and antibiotic-
antimycotic (Invitrogen), set up the day before in a 25-cm2
flask kept in a 5% CO2 incubator set at 37°C. Growth
medium in each flask was decanted before addition of the
inoculum. The flask was rocked for 5 minutes before 4 mL of
new growth medium was added to the flask. After flasks were
returned to the incubator, cells were examined for cytopatho-
genic effects (CPE) 3–7 d after inoculation.
Virus identification. Many viral isolates were identified
by virus-dilution serum constant-neutralization tests. Virus
dilutions from 10−4
to 10−6
were incubated with a panel of
hamster antisera (1:10) directed against JCV, La Crosse virus
(LACV; Bunyaviridae, Orthobunyavirus), snowshoe hare
virus (SSHV; Bunyaviridae, Orthobunyavirus), Keystone
virus (KEYV; Bunyaviridae, Orthobunyavirus), CVV, Potosi
virus (POV; Bunyaviridae, Orthobunyavirus), Jerry Slough
virus (JSV; Bunyaviridae, Orthobunyavirus) or hyperimmune
mouse ascetic fluids (1:10) against eastern equine encephalo-
myelitis virus (EEEV; Togaviridae: Alphavirus), Highlands
J virus (HJV; Togaviridae: Alphavirus), TVTV, WEEV, or
WNV for 1 hour at 37°C. The virus–serum mixtures were
then assayed for neutralizing activity by infecting Vero cell
cultures and screening them for CPE.8
West Nile virus also was identified by a TaqMan reverse
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay.
The QIAamp viral RNA mini kit protocol (Qiagen, Valencia,
CA) was used to extract RNA from a 70 mL sample of infec-
tious Vero cell-growth medium. The RT-PCR protocol was
used to identify isolates of WNV.9
The positive RNA control
for WNV was from an isolate from Culiseta melanura (8094-01)
that had been diluted 1:100. Its cycle threshold was 21 to 22.
Double processed sterile water (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was
used as the negative control. Primers and probe for WNV
used in the TaqMan RT-PCR assay were prepared by
QIAGEN. Primers were WNENV-forward 1160-1180
(5¢-TCAGCGATCTCTCCACCAAAG-3¢) and WNENV-
reverse 1229-1209 (5¢-GGGTCAGCACGTTTGTCATTG-3¢)
with probe WNENV 1186-1207 (5¢-TGCCCGACCATGG-
GAGAAGCTC-3¢).9
The probe had the 5¢ end labeled with
FAM reporter dye and the 3¢ end labeled with TAMRA
quencher dye. Primers, probe, and viral RNA were added to
the reagents in the TaqMan RT-PCR Ready-Mix Kit (PE
Applied Biosystems, Branchburg, NJ). Each isolate was pre-
pared for testing by adding 2.5 mL of viral RNA, 0.25 mL of
100 mM of each primer, 0.15 mL of 25 mM of probe, 12.5 mL of
2
+
buffer, 0.5 mL of RT-PCR enzyme, and 8.85 mL of water to
a microcentrifuge tube for a total volume of 25 mL. Samples
were amplified with a Smart Cycler that was run with Smart
Cycler software (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA). Amplification
included one cycle at 50°C for 20 min, one cycle at 95°C for
10 min, and 50 cycles at 95°C for 15 sec, and at 60°C for
60 sec. Isolates with a cycle threshold value of < 37 were
identified as WNV.
Four Orthobunyavirus isolates (JCV, POTV, CVV, and
TVTV) also were identified by RT-PCR. RNA was extracted
from primary viral isolates using the viral RNA Kit (Qiagen),
and RT-PCR was performed using the Titan One-Tube RT-
PCR System (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). Primers
BUNS+new: 5-TGACCAGTAGTGTACTCCAC-3_ and
BUNS-new: 5_-CAAGCAGTAGTGTGCTCCAC-3_ that
targeted the conserved terminal ends of the S-segment of the
Orthobunyavirus genus were used as previously described.10,11

reactions. The master mix for each restriction enzyme
consisted of 13.55 mL of water, 2.0 mL 10
+
reaction buffer,
0.2 mL 100
+
BSA, and 0.25 mL of the specific restriction
enzyme to which was added 4 mL of the amplified reagent
and then incubated overnight at 37°C.
Each digestion product was separated on a 2% agarose gel
and stained with ethidium bromide. The restriction enzymes
used and their fragment sizes for specific viruses were as
follows: EcoRV cut JCV at 364 bps and 627 bps, CAC81
severed POTV at 256 bps and 677 bps, Swal cut CVV at
411 bps and 539 bps, and Xhol cut TVTV at 233 bps and 740 bps.
Alternatively for isolates that could not be specifically iden-
tified using restriction enzymes or that were not identified by
virus-dilution serum constant-neutralization tests, amplifica-
tion products were purified using the PCR purification kit
(Qiagen) and commercially sequenced at the DNA Analysis
Facility (Yale University, New Haven, CT). Edited nucleotide
sequences were compared with those available on GenBank
using the Blastn search algorithm http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
Blast.cgi.
Genetic analyses of West Nile virus. The NS3 gene of WNV
was selected for analysis because this gene was previously
shown to have a strong phylogenetic signal.12
The RNA was
extracted from primary viral isolates using the Viral RNA Kit
(Qiagen). The RT-PCR was performed using the Titan One-
Tube RT-PCR System (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN)
and primers WNV4532f (TCGCGATTAGTGCGTACACC)
and WNV6516r (GAAGTGCTCAGGCATCTTTCC). Ampli-
fication was performed as follows: 1 cycle of 50°C for 30 min
and 94°C for 2 min, 10 cycles of 94°C for 15 sec, 55°C for
30 sec, and 68°C for 2 min, followed by 25 cycles of 94°C for
15 sec, 55°C for 30 sec, and 68°C for 2 min + 5 sec per cycle,
and 1 cycle of 68°C for 7 min. The PCR products (length =
1,984 bps) were commercially sequenced at the Yale DNA
Analysis Facility and edited sequences were aligned using
the ClustalW algorithm in MEGA 5.13
A phylogenetic tree
was reconstructed by maximum-likelihood (ML) analysis
in MEGA using the substitution model TN93 + G. The
optimal nucleotide substitution model was identified after
performing ML fits of 24 different models in MEGA. Support
for individual nodes was obtained by performing 1,000 boot-
strap replicates.
Genetic analyses of Jamestown Canyon, snowshoe hare,
and trivittatus viruses. The RNA was extracted from primary
virus cultures, the S segment was amplified by RT-PCR, and
amplification products were purified and sequenced accord-
ing to previously described methods.14
A total of 48 sequences
were combined with another 19 sequences available on
GenBank and aligned using MEGA. The final alignment
consisted of 832 characters that included the nucleocapsid
open reading frame and flanking portions of the 5¢ and 3¢
non-coding regions. Phylogenetic analysis was performed by
ML analysis as described earlier for WNV sequences except
using a different substitution model (T92 + G+I) that was
selected after performing ML fits in MEGA.
GenBank. The WNV, JCV, SSHV, and TVTV edited
nucleotide sequences were submitted to GenBank (accession
nos. KM215518–KM215607).
Statistics. The field infection rates for each species of mos-
quito infected with a specific virus within Cass, Richland,
Nelson, or Williams Counties for each week and year was
determined per 1,000 specimens using the bias-corrected max-
imum likelihood estimation method.15
Relative risk of infected vectors transmitting WNV to
humans in North Dakota in 2003–2006 was assessed using
information on mosquito abundance, infection rate, vector
competence, and biting behavior.16
Relative abundance was
determined by dividing the total numbers of a specific species
captured during the 4-year study by the total number of mos-
quitoes collected and identified (Table 1). It is noteworthy
that relative abundance was determined from numbers of
mosquitoes captured in CDC miniature light traps placed rel-
atively near the ground and may not reflect the abundance of
specific species feeding on humans. Infection rate was deter-
mined using a previously published formula.15
Vector compe-
tence (fraction of infected mosquitoes that will transmit virus
in a later feeding) was obtained from previously published
studies on specific species. The fraction of blood meals of
specific species that contained mammalian blood published
by others was used as a relative estimate of the likelihood of
the species feeding on humans. Humans shelter themselves
from mosquitoes and have significantly less exposure to mos-
quitoes compared with wild and large domestic mammals.
The use of the fraction of specimens feeding on mammals is a

relative estimate of the approximation that a specific species
would feed on humans.16
All mosquito species reported in
this study feed on humans.
A vector index was used to correlate weekly numbers of
documented WNV-infected humans with mosquito abundance
and infection rate.17
Human cases were recorded as the num-
ber for a specific week and were plotted at the middle of that
week (numbers were reported at the end of the week by the
North Dakota Department of Health).18
The average numbers
of a specific vector per trap-night per week were multiplied by
its infection rate (IR)/1,000 to give the vector index, the aver-
age number of infected mosquitoes per trap-night.
RESULTS
Mosquitoes. A total of 3,377,883 specimens representing
34 species were collected and identified in 2003–2006 (Table 1).
Data for mosquito species (N = 21) that did not yield virus
are not included. Aedes vexans was dominate throughout the
state and represented 83.2% of the specimens identified.
Ochlerotatus trivittatus, Ochlerotatus melanimon, Culex tarsalis,
and Ochlerotatus dorsalis made up 7.7%, 2.7%, 2.2%, and 1.7%,
respectively.
Viruses. Seven distinct viruses were identified among the
816 isolates (Table 2). Trivittatus virus (46.4%), WNV
(22.8%), CVV (18.5%), and JCV (10.8%) were the most
prevalent. Trivittatus virus was isolated from mosquitoes col-
lected from June 2 through the week of October 6. The other
viruses tended to be isolated from mosquitoes collected from
mid to late June and early July through the second week of
September. Potosi virus was an exception and was isolated
during the weeks of August 18 through September 22.
Viruses were isolated from 13 species of mosquitoes (Table 3).
The largest numbers of viral isolations were from Oc. trivittatus
(N = 313), Ae. vexans (N = 289), and Cx. tarsalis (N = 131).
Six different viral species were isolated from Ae. vexans
(CVV, JCV, POTV, SSHV, TVTV, and WNV). Five different
viruses were isolated from Cx. tarsalis (CVV, JCV, TVTV,
WNV, and WEEV), Oc. dorsalis (CVV, JCV, POTV,
TVTV, and WNV), and Oc. trivittatus (CVV, JCV, SSHV,
TVTV, and WNV). Four and three different viruses were
isolated from Culiseta inornata (CVV, JCV, POTV, and
WNV) and Ochlerotatus flavescens (CVV, JCV, and WNV).
West Nile virus. This invasive Flavivirus was isolated in
2003–2006 from five genera and nine species collected in
Nelson, Cass, Richland, and Williams Counties (Tables 2
and 3). The largest numbers of isolations were from Cx. tarsalis
(N = 121) and Ae. vexans (N = 55). The WNV IR per thousand
pooled mosquitoes for all species by year and county are shown
in Supplemental Table 1. Culex tarsalis and Ae. vexans IRs by
county and year ranged from 1.12 to 12.26 and < 0.01 to 0.19
per thousand specimens, respectively.
Culex tarsalis was collected from the first week of June into
the first week of October (Figure 2A). Largest numbers were
collected from the week June 30 through the week August 4
when numbers per trap-night averaged 134 to 239. West Nile
virus was isolated from Cx. tarsalis from the last week of June
through the second week of September. Eighty-eight percent
of the isolations from Cx. tarsalis were made during a 7-week
period from the week beginning July 14 through the week

beginning August 25. The IRs for Cx. tarsalis tended to
increase as the season progressed from 0.93 per thousand
specimens on June 30 to 8.07 and 5.64 during the weeks of
September 1 and 8.
Aedes vexans averaging 2,705 per trap-night were collected
during the week of June 2 and continued to be collected
through the week of October 6 (Figure 2B). Populations aver-
aged 5,083 to 9,394 specimens per trap-night from the week of
June 16 through the week of July 14. Numbers averaged 1,270
per trap-night during the week of September 15. West Nile
virus was first isolated from Ae. vexans during the week of
June 16, but consistent isolations began during the week of

July 7 and continued through the week of September 8.
Eighty-four percent of the 55 isolations were obtained during
a 5-week period from July 7 through the week of August 4.
Smaller numbers of isolations were made from Coquillettidia
perturbans, Cs. inornata, Oc. dorsalis, Oc. flavescens,
Oc. spencerii, Ochlerotatus triseriatus, and Oc. trivittatus
(Table 3, Supplemental Table 1). West Nile virus was isolated
from Oc. dorsalis during the week of June 16.
The risk of seven infected species for transmitting WNV to
humans in North Dakota was assessed using a risk-assessment
method, which used information on mosquito abundance,
infection rate, vector competence, and biting behavior (Sup-
plemental Table 2).16
The greatest seasonal risk of 61.4% was
from Cx. tarsalis. The second largest risk was from Ae. vexans
with a value of 34.0%. The risks of five other species were
much lower, £ 1.8%.
We evaluated the importance of specific species on trans-
mission of WNV in Cass County during the years of 2003–
2005. Mosquitoes were trapped at the same five trapping sites
during the 3 years when numbers of human cases in Cass
County were 32, 0, and 12. The risks of the five species that
were infected are shown in Supplemental Table 3. The largest
number of human cases was in 2003 when the risks of being
bitten by infected Ae. vexans and Cx. tarsalis were 73.6% and
23.9%. In 2004 and 2005, risks of being infected by Ae. vexans
were 24.8% and 17.3% and by Cx. tarsalis were 61.3% and
76.6%, respectively, when numbers of human cases were 0
and 12. The IRs for Ae. vexans were 9.5 and 6.3 times greater
in 2003 than in 2004 and 2005, respectively. The IRs for
Cx. tarsalis were 5.6 and 2.6 times greater in 2003 than in
2004 and 2005. These data suggest that infected Ae. vexans
participated in vectoring WNV in North Dakota in 2003 when
617 people were documented to have been infected.
Dates of onset of humans infected with WNV and the
weekly numbers of isolations of WNV from all mosquitoes
for 2003–2006 are shown in Figure 3. The earliest human case
was reported during the week of May 26 and the last cases
were reported during the week of October 6. A steady
increase in numbers of human cases began in mid-June and
peaked during the last week of August with a 182 cases. West
Nile virus was first isolated on June 16. Numbers of isolations
increased from the last week of June through July and peaked
on August 4, when 42 isolations were made, 2 to 3 weeks
before the peaks of human cases. The decline of human cases
beginning during the week of September 1 followed by
3 weeks the reduction in numbers of isolations that began
during the week of August 11.
The weekly risk of humans being bitten by an infectious
mosquito was also evaluated (Supplemental Table 4). The
risks of being bitten by Cx. tarsalis were greater than being
bitten by Ae. vexans and five other vector species during most
weeks beginning in mid-July through August. However dur-
ing this time period, the weekly risk of being bitten by infec-
tious Ae. vexans plus the lesser important vectors varied from
10.3% to 57.8%.
We compared the weekly vector indexes for Cx. tarsalis,
Ae. vexans, and the seven other vectors to the onset of human
cases for 2003–2006 (Figure 4).17
The weekly vector index for
all vectors exceeded two only in 2003 when the largest out-
break of West Nile fever erupted with 617 cases. The weekly
vector indexes for Ae. vexans in 2003 were greater than
indexes for Cx. tarsalis the last 2 weeks of July through the
first week of August, and were similar during the second and
third weeks of August (Figure 4, Supplemental Table 5). The
vector index for all species combined in 2003 exceeded one
during the third week of July and exceeded two during the last
Figure 3. Relation between onset of human disease and total number of West Nile virus isolates from all mosquito species, North Dakota,
2003–2006.

week of July and first week of August. The increasing onset
of human disease of 75 to 171 cases per week lagged by about
2 to 3 weeks the increasing vector index. The weekly vector
indexes in the years 2004–2006, when numbers of human
cases varied from 20 to 137, exceeded one only in 1 week in
2005 (Figure 4, Supplemental Tables 6–8). Cx. tarsalis had a
higher weekly vector index compared with Ae. vexans during
most weeks during these 3 years. The composite weekly vec-
tor indexes during 2003–2006 for Cx. tarsalis were similar to
those for Ae. vexans plus the other vectors from the middle of
Figure 4. Stacked area graphs showing weekly vector index for Culex tarsalis, Aedes vexans, and seven other species relative to
weekly numbers of human cases diagnosed with West Nile virus infection 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2003–2006. The other species were
Coquillettidia perturbans, Culiseta inornata, Ochlerotatus dorsalis, Ochlerotatus flavescens, Ochlerotatus spencerii, Ochlerotatus triseriatus, and
Ochlerotatus trivittatus.

June through the last week of July, but weekly vector indexes
throughout August were higher for Cx. tarsalis (Figure 4,
Supplemental Table 9).
Figure 5 depicts the ML tree of WNV sequences from
North Dakota. The overall topology is consistent with prior
analyses and shows that viruses segregate into two major
groups termed the NY99 and WN02 genotypes in North
America.19,20
Earlier WNV isolates from the northeastern
United States form the NY99 genotype, whereas later strains
from North Dakota and the rest of the US cluster into the
WN02 genotype.
Cache Valley virus. This Bunyamwera serogroup virus of
the genus Orthobunyavirus was isolated from mosquitoes cap-
tured in 2003 and 2005 but not in 2004 and 2006 (Table 2).
Single pools of Cs. inornata collected on July 4 in Nelson
County and of Oc. trivittatus collected on July 22 in Cass
County yielded positive Vero cell cultures in 2003. In 2005,
CVV was widespread and prevalent in both eastern (Cass
County) and western (Williams County) North Dakota. Pools
from five genera and nine species were positive for CVV
(Table 3). The largest numbers of isolations were from
Ae. vexans (N = 92), Cs. inornata (N = 27), and Oc. dorsalis
(N = 15). The IRs for each species by year and county are
shown in Supplemental Table 10 and ranged from 0.03 in
Oc. trivittatus to 16.55 in Anopheles earlei in Williams County,
and from 0.04 in Ae. vexans to 1.94 in Cs. inornata in Cass
County. Ninety-seven percent of the isolations were made
during the weeks of August 1 through September 8 (Figure 6).
The weekly IRs were relatively high during this 6-week
period, ranging from 0.14 to 1.09. Most isolations of CVV
were made in August and early September when mosquito
populations were significantly reduced from mid-June
through mid-July.
Jamestown Canyon virus. This widely distributed
Orthobunyavirus in the United States was isolated in 2003–
2006 from mosquitoes captured in four counties (Table 2).
Eighty-eight isolations were made from four genera and eight
species (Table 3). The largest numbers of isolations were from
Ae. vexans (N = 58), Oc. trivittatus (N = 12), and Oc. dorsalis
(N = 8) (Table 3). The IRs for year and county ranged
from 0.01–0.08, 0.02–0.51, and 0.07–1.21 for Ae. vexans,
Oc. trivittatus, and Oc. dorsalis, respectively (Supplemental
Table 11). Isolations were made from mosquitoes collected
from the week of June 30 through the week of September 8
(Figure 7). Ninety-eight percent of the isolations were from
mosquitoes collected from the week of June 30 through the
week beginning August 25.
Phylogenetic analysis of 44 isolates of JCV showed that the
vast majority belonged to a single clade of genetically related
strains (Figure 8). Forty-one isolates from seven species, four
different counties, and four different years were similar to the
lineage A isolates from Connecticut.14
Three isolates sorted
by phylogenetic analysis and by virus-dilution serum constant-
neutralization tests were the Jerry Slough variant of JCV.
Trivittatus virus. This California encephalitis virus was the
most frequently isolated virus (Table 2). The 379 isolates were
from three genera and six species collected in Cass, Williams,
and Richland Counties in 2003–2006 (Table 3). Two-hundred
ninety-five and 77 of the isolates were from Oc. trivittatus and
Ae. vexans, respectively. The IRs for Ochlerotatus trivittatus
and Ae. vexans by year and county ranged from 0.70 to 5.09
and 0.01 to 0.42, respectively (Supplemental Table 12).

ARBOVIRUSES IN NORTH DAKOTA 385
Virus was isolated from Oc. trivittatus from early June to
early October in 2003–2006 (Figure 9). Ninety-seven percent
of the isolates were from early June through the week of
August 4. Weekly IRs was equal to or > 0.39. No isolates were
obtained during the weeks of September 8, 15, and 29. One
pool of 50 specimens was dually infected with TVTV and WNV.
Aedes vexans infected with TVTV were collected from
June 8 through August 5. Two isolates from Ae. vexans were
shown by phylogenetic analysis to be similar to the prototype
strain isolated from Oc. trivittatus and distinctly different from
JCV (Figure 8).21
Western equine encephalomyelitis virus. This native
Alphavirus was isolated from two pools of Cx. tarsalis col-
lected on August 3 and August 10, 2004 in Williams County
(Tables 2 and 3). The IR was 0.30 (Supplemental Table 13).
Snowshoe hare virus. This California encephalitis virus was
isolated in Cass County from one pool of Oc. trivittatus col-
lected on July 1, 2004 and from three pools of Ae. vexans
collected on July 13, 2005 (Tables 2 and 3, Supplemental
Table 13). The IR for both species was 0.01. Two isolates from
Ae. vexans were phylogenetically similar to the snowshoe
hare virus (Figure 8).
Potosi virus. This Orthobunyavirus was isolated from three
species collected in Cass County from August 22 through
September 28, 2005 (Table 2 and 3, Supplemental Table 13).
Four isolations were from Ae. vexans (IR = 0.01). Single
isolations were from Oc. dorsalis (IR = 0.04) and from
Cs. inornata (IR = 0.08).
DISCUSSION
Seven species of viruses circulated among 13 species of
North Dakota mosquitoes during 2003–2006 (Tables 2
and 3). Five of the viruses cause human disease: WNV,
JCV, CVV, SSHV, and WEEV. West Nile virus was isolated
from four North Dakota counties in 2003–2006 (Table 2).
Cache Valley virus was isolated from three counties in 2003
and in 2005. Jamestown Canyon virus was isolated from
three counties in 2003–2006. Snowshoe hare virus and WEEV
were isolated from one county each in 2004 and 2005 and
in 2004, respectively.
Culex tarsalis and Ae. vexans were both important vectors
of WNV in North Dakota. This virus was isolated from nine
species of mosquitoes and multiple isolations were made from
Figure 7. Weekly numbers of Jamestown Canyon virus isolations and infection rates (IR) relative to the mean number per trap-night of
Aedes vexans, Culex tarsalis, Culiseta inornata, Ochlerotatus dorsalis, Ochlerotatus flavescens, Ochlerotatus melanimon, Ochlerotatus sticticus,
and Ochlerotatus trivittatus, North Dakota, 2003–2006.

four species, but Cx. tarsalis and Ae. vexans accounted for
95.4% of the total risk for the years 2003–2006 (Supplemental
Table 2).16
The relatively high IR for Cx. tarsalis and the
abundance of Ae. vexans accounted for their relatively high
risks. Culex tarsalis was the more important with a risk factor
of 61.4%. However, the largest epidemic of WNV infection in
North Dakota was recorded in 2003, and in Cass County with
32 cases, humans had a greater risk of being bitten by infected
Ae. vexans (73.6%) (Supplemental Table 3). The abundance
and relatively high IR of 0.19 per thousand tested mosquitoes
accounted for the risk of Ae. vexans transmitting WNV to
humans in 2003. Previous laboratory and field studies identi-
fied Cx. tarsalis as one of the most important vectors in west-
ern United States,22–25
including North Dakota.26
Our current
investigations confirm this conclusion, but we also documented
Ae. vexans to be an important vector. Previously, WNV was
detected only in Cx. tarsalis in North Dakota.26,27
Unlike
studies elsewhere in the United States where Ae. vexans was
not as abundant,28–30
numbers per trap-night in North Dakota
averaged > 1,890 from June 2 through the week of August 4
and averaged as high as 9,393 per trap-night during the week
of July 7 (Figure 2B).
Culex tarsalis feeds on both birds and mammals,31–35
including humans.36
It was relatively abundant in North
Dakota from the end of June through the end of August, had
a relatively high IR during the summer, is efficient in trans-
mitting this virus horizontally,22,24,25,37
and is relatively effi-
cient in transmitting this virus vertically.24,38,39
Culex tarsalis
was collected during the weeks of June 2 to October 6, similar
to collections made in Grand Forks, North Dakota,26
but
populations were highest from the week of June 30 through
August ranging from 63.9 to 239.4 per trap-night (Figure 2A).
The Cx. tarsalis weekly risk and vector index was dominant
during August except in 2003 (Supplemental Tables 4–9,
Figure 4). These data were similar to those reported in Grand
Forks, ND.26,27
The IR was near or greater than three per
thousand specimens, and populations were relatively abun-
dant (Figure 2A). The IR increased in early September, but
populations were drastically reduced and risk of transmission
reduced. It is noteworthy that Cx. pipiens, which is a relatively
important vector in Illinois and Colorado,17,40
was not preva-
lent in our collections in North Dakota, although we did not
use gravid traps to collect mosquitoes.41
Aedes vexans is the most abundant mosquito in North
Dakota,42
and it is an aggressive feeder on humans.43
Infected
specimens with WNV were collected during the same weeks
of summer as were Cx. tarsalis (Figure 2A, B), and females
with a disseminated infection transmit the virus by bite.37
It
primarily feeds on mammals, particularly large mammals, and
infrequently feeds on birds.31,44–46
More than 1,850 specimens
were captured per trap-night from early June through the first
week of August, and more than a 1,000 specimens were col-
lected per trap-night in mid-September. Weekly risk of being
bitten by infected specimens ranged from 36.2% to 74.0%
during most of July and the first week of August, but declined
to 10.3–14.5% for the remainder of August (Supplemental
Table 4). It increased to 35.5% and 60.0% in early September.
Aedes vexans may become infected by feeding on small or
Figure 9. Weekly numbers of trivittatus virus isolations and infections rates (IR) relative to the mean number per trap-night of Ochlerotatus
trivittatus, North Dakota, 2003–2006.
388 ANDERSON AND OTHERS
medium-sized mammals, which have been reported to have
specific antibodies to WNV,47
shown to produce viremias
sufficient to infect mosquitoes,48–51
and found naturally
infected in the field.52
The risk that humans will acquire an infectious bite was
greatest from the middle of July through the end of August
with transmission still occurring in early September (Supple-
mental Table 4). The vector index was highest from the mid-
dle of July through the end of August (Supplemental Table 9,
Figure 4). Increasing vector indexes preceded onset of
human symptoms by 2 to 3 weeks. This time-lag results from
a 7–14-day delay for symptoms to appear and a several day
WNV extrinsic incubation period in the mosquito.53,54
With the exceptions of weeks June 16, July 7, July 28, and
September 8, human risk of being bitten by infected
Cx. tarsalis during the weeks of June 30 through September 8
was greater than being bitten by other vector species, includ-
ing Ae. vexans. Nonetheless, the weekly risk of being bitten by
an infectious Ae. vexans plus other vector species, other than
Cx. tarsalis, from mid-July through August ranged from
10.3% to 57.8%. Vector indexes were also relatively high for
Cx. tarsalis during mid-July through August. The earliest
human cases may have resulted from bites from Ae. vexans
and Oc. dorsalis, which were relatively abundant during June.
Alternatively, humans may have been bitten by Cx. tarsalis
that overwintered as adults and were vertically infected.24,38,39
West Nile virus has been isolated from overwintering
Cx. pipiens and has been shown to survive winter in unfed,
vertically infected Cx. pipiens with amplification initiated
in the spring by horizontal transmission.55,56
Human cases
reported in October may have resulted from bites by infected
Cx. tarsalis or Ae. vexans.
Phylogenetic analysis of WNV sequences of isolates made
from 2003 to 2006 showed that strains circulating in North
Dakota were members of the WN02 genotype (Figure 5).
These findings are consistent with those reported elsewhere
in the United States.19,20
Five of the viruses belong to the genus Orthobunyavirus in
the family Bunyaviridae. Cache Valley virus, originally iso-
lated from Cx. inornata collected in Cache Valley, Utah in
1956,57
has been reported from four Canadian provinces,
22 states, including North Dakota, northern Mexico, and
Jamaica.58–60
Our isolations of CVV from Ae. vexans,
Cs. inornata, Oc. dorsalis, and six other species (Table 3,
Supplemental Table 10) are consistent with previous findings
of its presence in several species of mosquitoes and from
mammals, including humans.58,61
It causes congenital defects
in fetal or neonatal sheep and cattle,62,63
including those in
North Dakota,64
has caused disease in humans,61,65,66
and it
may be responsible for birth defects in humans.67
Cache Valley virus was isolated in two of the four years
sampled and was prevalent only in 2005 when it was isolated
from 149 pools of mosquitoes collected in eastern and western
North Dakota (Table 2). These data suggest that CVV
becomes epizootic periodically. Although four isolations were
made in July when mosquito populations of the nine infected
species were highest, 96.7% of the isolations were made
throughout August and the first week of September when
mosquito abundance was significantly reduced compared with
their numbers in June and July (Figure 6). The infection rate
in August and the first week of September was relatively high
ranging from 0.14 to 1.09 per 1,000 specimens tested and is the
time when sheep and cattle are most likely to become infected
with virus.
Jamestown Canyon virus is widely distributed in North
America and causes a mild febrile illness that may cause cen-
tral nervous system infection.68,69
Human cases are relatively
rare with 15 cases reported from 2004 to 2010, including one
from Montana in 2009,69
and two cases were reported during
2012.70
Although not previously reported from North Dakota,
we found this virus to be widespread. It is transmitted primar-
ily by mammalian-feeding Aedes and Ochlerotatus mosqui-
toes.71
Deer are considered the primary hosts, although other
ungulates may also be involved.71
This virus survives winter in
mosquito eggs via vertical transmission.71
Our isolation of
JCV from eight species within four genera from four counties
during the 4 years confirms earlier findings that several spe-
cies are likely vectors (Table 2 and 3) The largest numbers of
isolations were from Ae. vexans, but IRs were all < 0.1 per
thousand specimens tested (Supplemental Table 11). Species
less numerous but with larger IRs included Cs. inornata,
Oc. dorsalis, Oc. flavescens, Ochlerotatus melanimon, and
Oc. trivittatus. Species not previously reported to be infected
included Cx. tarsalis and Oc. flavescens. This virus was iso-
lated from the last week of June to the second week of
September (Figure 7). Most isolates (98%) were from mos-
quitoes collected during the week of June 30 through the last
week of August. Sequence analysis of 44 isolates from North
Dakota showed that most belonged to Lineage A (Figure 8).
Forty-one isolates from seven species, collected in four differ-
ent counties, and four different years were similar to the line-
age A isolates from Connecticut.14
Three isolates belonged to
the Jerry Slough variant.72
Our findings suggest the JCV
strains were stably maintained in North Dakota, infecting a
number of different mosquito species.
Trivittatus virus, which was originally isolated in Bismarck,
North Dakota in 1948,21
was the most frequently isolated
virus. Although isolated from six species, 77.8% were from
Oc. trivittatus, confirming it as the most important vector
(Table 3).73–75
Many of the remaining isolates (20.3%) were
from Ae. vexans. The IRs for Oc. trivittatus by county and
year ranged from 0.70 to 5.09 and were significantly higher
than the IRs for Ae. vexans, which ranged from 0.01 to 0.42
(Supplemental Table 12). This virus, which is transmitted
horizontally and vertically by Oc. trivittatus,73–76
was isolated
during most weeks of the summer and fall, particularly during
June and July when Oc. trivittatus were most abundant
(Figure 9). Two isolates were genetically similar to the proto-
type strain (Figure 8). This virus infects humans,77
but rarely
causes clinical symptoms.71
Seasonal relationships between numbers of Oc. trivittatus
infected with TVTV and mosquitoes infected with CVV were
markedly different (Figures 6 and 9). Differences reflect at
least in part the means by which these mosquitoes become
infected. Isolations of TVTV were made weekly, with the
exception of 3 weeks in September, from Oc. trivittatus
throughout the season from early June to the first week of
October (Figure 9). Vertical transmission is responsible for
early season-infection, and vertical and horizontal transmis-
sion cause infection later in the season.73–76
In contrast, hori-
zontal transmission likely is the primary means of infection
during summer for CVV. In mid-June through late July,
weekly vector numbers per trap-night averaged > 4,000 to
> 14,000 and few isolations were recorded (Figure 6). In late
ARBOVIRUSES IN NORTH DAKOTA 389
July, after numbers of mosquitoes declined, numbers of
weekly isolations in August and early September increased
to as high as 50 per week. Mosquitoes collected in June and
early July likely had not fed on viremic mammals, whereas
relative numbers of those collected in late July and into the
first week of September likely became infected by feeding on
viremic mammals.
Potosi virus originally isolated from Ae. albopictus collected
in Potosi, MO in 1989,78
also has been isolated from several
species of mammal-feeding mosquitoes in Illinois, Michigan,
Ohio, the Carolinas, Connecticut, and New York.79–84
We
now report POTV in three species in North Dakota. Isolation
of POTV from four pools of Ae. vexans and single pools of
Ae. dorsalis and Cx. inornata in 2005 clearly shows its distri-
bution extends into the northern great plains. Infected mos-
quitoes were collected from late August through the last week
of September 2005. This virus is horizontally transmitted by
several species to white-tailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus.85,86
Although POTV is not known to cause human disease, related
Bunyamwera viruses are known to cause febrile illness, central
neurological system disease, and hemorrhagic fever.61,87–89
It is
also worth noting that POTV may co-circulate with CVV,
which causes congenital defects in sheep and cattle,62,63
during
late August and September.
Snowshoe hare virus was initially isolated in 1959 in
Montana from a snowshoe hare, Lepus americanus,90
and sub-
sequently from at least 23 species of mosquitoes,91
which were
collected in Alaska,91
Montana,91
New York,92
Wisconsin,92
Massachusetts,92
and all Canadian provinces.93,94
Our isola-
tions of SSHV from Ae. vexans and Oc. trivittatus are the first
from North Dakota. They were genetically similar to a known
strain of SSHV (Figure 8). This virus is transmitted horizon-
tally by several species of mosquitoes in the genera Aedes,
Ochlerotatus, and Culiseta, and it is also transmitted verti-
cally.95,96
Snowshoe hares and squirrels are principal reservoir
hosts in Canada.93,94
Human infection ranges from absence of
clinical disease to non-fatal meningitis and encephalitis.93,94
Disease in domestic animals has occurred infrequently.97
Western equine encephalomyelitis virus causes disease and
death in humans and horses in western and central Canada
and the United States, Mexico, Guyana, Brazil, Uruguay, and
Argentina.98
One of the largest human epidemics of WEEV
occurred in North Dakota in 1941.1
Since 1955, a total of
93 cases have been documented in North Dakota, but none
has been reported since 1987.99,100
The basic transmission
cycle involves Cx. tarsalis and passerine birds. Humans and
horses are tangential hosts. Our isolation of WEEV from two
pools of Cx. tarsalis in 2005 shows this virus still persists at
low levels in North Dakota. The decline of WEEV as a
human and equine health problem in North Dakota is similar
to declines reported in Kern County, CA and elsewhere in
North America.101,102
Both WNV and WEEV are amplified
in birds after bites by infected Cx. tarsalis, but WEEV has not
amplified sufficiently in recent decades to infect humans and
horses. Reasons for the suppression of WEEV in the years
preceding and after the introduction of WNV are not known.
