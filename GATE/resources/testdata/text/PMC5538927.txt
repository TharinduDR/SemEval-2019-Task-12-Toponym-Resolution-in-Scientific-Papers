Background: Coliphages have been proposed as indicators of fecal
contamination in recreational waters because they better mimic the
persistence of pathogenic viruses in the environment and wastewater
treatment than fecal indicator bacteria. We estimated the association
between coliphages and gastrointestinal illness and compared it with
the association with culturable enterococci.
Methods: We pooled data from six prospective cohort studies that
enrolled coastal beachgoers in California, Alabama, and Rhode
Island. Water samples were collected and gastrointestinal illness
within 10 days of the beach visit was recorded. Samples were
tested for enterococci and male-specific and somatic coliphages.
We estimated cumulative incidence ratios (CIR) for the association
between swimming in water with detectable coliphage and gastrointestinal illness when human fecal pollution was likely present,
not likely present, and under all conditions combined. The reference group was unexposed swimmers. We defined continuous and
threshold-based exposures (coliphage present/absent, enterococci
>35 vs. ≤
­ 35 CFU/100 ml).

Results: Under all conditions combined, there was no association
between gastrointestinal illness and swimming in water with detectable coliphage or enterococci. When human fecal pollution was likely
present, coliphage and enterococci were associated with increased
gastrointestinal illness, and there was an association between malespecific coliphage level and illness that was somewhat stronger than
the association between enterococci and illness. There were no substantial differences between male-specific and somatic coliphage.
Conclusions: Somatic coliphage and enterococci had similar associations with gastrointestinal illness; there was some evidence that
male-specific coliphage had a stronger association with illness than
enterococci in marine waters with human fecal contamination.

F

ecal indicator bacteria, such as enterococci, are the basis
for beach monitoring programs around the world.1 Their
concentrations have been linked to increased risk of gastrointestinal illness in swimmers.2 Because they are easier to
measure and are abundant in the human intestinal tract, fecal
indicator bacteria can serve as a proxy for the numerous pathogens present in human waste. They are measured in preference
to pathogens because measuring pathogens directly is expensive and presents substantial technical challenges. However,
it has been suggested that viruses are responsible for most
illness resulting from recreational water exposure.3,4 Consistent with this hypothesis, some studies have found that the
greatest excess illness among swimmers occurs in the 2 days
following ocean exposure, which aligns with the incubation
periods for common waterborne viruses, such as norovirus or
adenovirus.5–8
Fecal indicator bacteria have shortcomings as indicators of viral contamination,1 including their persistance9 and
in many cases growth10–13 in the environment. Moreover, modern wastewater treatment facilities are designed to reduce fecal
indicator bacteria levels to meet water quality standards, but
many human enteric pathogens are less susceptible than bacteria to disinfection regimes and may remain infectious in discharged wastewater effluent.14,15 Due to their smaller size and
disparate physiology, viruses can persist in the environment

and move through sand, sediment, and groundwater, while bacteria are typically filtered by soil.13,16,17 Consistent with these
shortcomings, several studies have found weak associations
between enteric viruses and fecal indicator bacteria in marine
waters.18–21
An alternative to measuring fecal indicator bacteria is
to measure coliphages, viruses that infect Escherichia coli
whose environmental degradation characteristics more closely
mimic that of viruses.22–27 Coliphages meet many of the criteria for an ideal indicator of fecal contamination of water28,29:
(1) They are present when enteric viruses are present in marine
and other waters29–32; (2) The density of coliphages is typically
much greater than that of human viruses,33–35 making them
easier to detect; (3) They are specific to fecal contamination of
water36–38; (4) Their resistance and response to disinfection is
similar to that of pathogens of interest31,32,39; and (5) They are
nonpathogenic37 and can easily be detected and enumerated
with inexpensive methods.29,40–45
There are two types of coliphages: male-specific coliphages, which infect E. coli via the F sex pilus, and somatic
coliphages, which attach to the exterior of E. coli cells. Associations with illness may vary by coliphage type. Male-specific
coliphage morphology resembles that of many enteric viruses;
fewer somatic coliphages closely resemble enteric viruses.46
In some studies, male-specific coliphages had a stronger association with pathogens than somatic coliphage.21 Associations
with illness might also vary by the assay used to detect coliphage. Two commonly used culture-based methods are Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Method 1601 and 1602.
EPA 1601 includes an enrichment step, which may affect the
diversity of coliphage strains detected.47 Coliphage counts
from EPA 1601 may be more variable because the method utilizes the most probable number technique for enumeration,
whereas EPA 1602 relies on direct counts.
Nine studies have examined whether coliphages are
associated with increased gastrointestinal illness,48–56 and
six studies found a positive association.48,50–52,55,56 However,
the type of coliphage, coliphage enumeration method, and
strength of associations varied, and the sample size was limited in several studies. We combined coliphage data from six
prospective cohort studies at beaches from the Pacific, Atlantic, and Gulf of Mexico coasts that used a common sampling
design. Using this data, we evaluated whether coliphages
alone or as a combined indicator with culturable enterococci
predicted gastrointestinal illness as well as enterococci, one
of the nationally recommended fecal indicator bacteria for
protecting public health in ambient waters designated for primary contact recreation.57

Coliphages as Indicators of Illness in Water

Island: Doheny State Beach in Dana Point, Malibu Surfrider
State Beach, Mission Bay in San Diego, and Avalon Beach
on Catalina Island in southern California, Fairhope Municipal
Beach in Alabama, and Goddard Memorial State Park Beach
in Rhode Island (eFigure1 and eTable 1; http://links.lww.com/
EDE/B203).5,7,8,50,51,55

Enrollment
Studies enrolled beach visitors between May and September from 2003 to 2009. Eligibility criteria included: (1)
no previous participation in the study beaches and (2) at least
one household member at the beach ≥18 years old (see eTable
2; http://links.lww.com/EDE/B203 for eligibility details). At
enrollment, interviewers recorded participants’ beach location, current health status, and recreational water exposure.
Interviewers contacted participants 10–14 days later by phone
to ascertain illness, demographic information, pre-existing
health conditions, and water exposure since enrollment. Studies received approval from the institutional review boards at
the University of California, Berkeley, the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill, and the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention. Participation of human subjects did not occur
until after informed consent was obtained.

Water Quality Sampling and Analysis
Each day, studies collected 125 ml to 1 L water samples
in sterile containers at shin (0.3–0.5 m) or waist (1 m) depth.
The total number of water samples collected and analyzed
for coliphage per day ranged from one composite sample (a
combination of individual samples collected at different locations within a given beach) at Mission Bay to 18 at Fairhope
and Goddard beaches. See eTable 3 (http://links.lww.com/
EDE/B203) for further details. Studies detected male-specific
and somatic coliphage in water samples using culture-based
methods (EPA 1601 and 1602).40,41 EPA 1601 was modified
for use as a most probable number (MPN) procedure. Assays
conducted to detect indicators varied by beach; somatic (EPA
1601) was analyzed at Avalon, Doheny, and Mission Bay;
somatic (EPA 1602) was analyzed at Avalon and Doheny;
male-specific (EPA 1601) was analyzed at all six beaches;
male-specific (EPA 1602) was analyzed at Avalon and Doheny
(eTable 4; http://links.lww.com/EDE/B203). Studies measured
the level of enterococci in water samples at all six beaches
using culture-based EPA Method 1600 on mEI agar except
at Mission Bay, which used Enterolert (IDEXX, Westbrook,
ME). We imputed values below the detection limit with 0.1
colony forming units (CFU) per 100 ml for enterococci and
0.1 plaque-forming units (PFU) per 100 ml for coliphages.
Further details about water sample analysis are in eTable 3
(http://links.lww.com/EDE/B203).

Exposure Definitions
We defined “beachgoers” as individuals who recreated
at the beach, regardless of whether they entered the water,
“swimmers” as beachgoers who had water contact above the

waist, and “nonswimmers” as those who had no water contact. We matched the daily geometric mean of coliphage and
enterococci levels at Avalon, Doheny, and Malibu beaches to
participants based on their swim location because there was
greater heterogeneity in water quality at different sites at these
beaches; for Mission Bay, we matched the level of coliphage
in the single composite sample at each beach to swimmers;
for the other beaches, we averaged over all samples present on
the beach visit day. At Fairhope and Goddard beaches, where
there was less heterogeneity in water quality across sample
locations, we matched participants to the daily geometric
mean at each beach, consistent with how the original authors
classified exposure.58 The original studies indicated no substantial differences in the associations between the daily averages of fecal indicators and averages specific to a swimmer’s
time and location. We assigned indicator levels below the
detectable limits a value of 0.1 MPN/100 ml for coliphage and
0.1 CFU/100 ml for enterococci.

Outcome Definition
The primary outcome for this study was incident gastrointestinal illness within 10 days of exposure. Gastrointestinal illness was defined as: (i) diarrhea or (ii) vomiting or (iii)
nausea and stomachache, or (iv) nausea or stomach ache and
missed regular activities as a result of illness.5,7,8,55

Beach Conditions Classification
We classified study days by whether human fecal contamination was likely to be present (“human-impacted conditions”). At Fairhope and Goddard beaches, we considered
all study days to be human-impacted because of the presence
of nearby wastewater treatment facilities and discharges.55 At
Doheny Beach, during the spring and summer, a sand berm
forms that blocks the flow of San Juan Creek into the surf
zone. We classified days when the berm was open as humanimpacted.50 At Avalon Beach, wastewater from a faulty sanitary sewer system discharges in submarine groundwater
through the sand and is moderated by tidal conditions.8 We
classified days when groundwater flow was above the median
as human-impacted and those when it was below median flow
as not human-impacted. We classified all days at Malibu and
Mission Bay beaches as not human-impacted because there
were no known sources of fecal discharge at those sites. See
eAppendix 1 (http://links.lww.com/EDE/B203) for more
additional information on our beach conditions classification.

Statistical Analysis
Primary Analysis
We performed two types of statistical analyses. The first
was a threshold analysis using an indicator for coliphage presence/absence; the reference group was swimmers recreating
in water without detectable coliphage (eAppendix 2; http://
links.lww.com/EDE/B203). Coliphage was considered present if any samples on the beach visit day contained detectable
646 | www.epidem.com

Epidemiology • Volume 28, Number 5, September 2017

coliphage and absent if none did. For enterococci, the threshold
was a geometric mean >35 CFU/100 ml, corresponding to the
present water quality standard.57 We also created a joint indicator for coliphage and enterococci classified as 1 if coliphage
was detected and the enterococci level was >35 CFU/100 ml
and 0 if coliphage was not detected and the enterococci level
was ≤35 CFU/100 ml. For both the single and joint indicators,
we estimated cumulative incidence ratios (CIRs) that pooled
across coliphage detection method (EPA 1601 or 1602). The
second approach used continuous log10 levels of enterococci
(CFU/100 ml) and coliphage (PFU/100 ml) as the exposure.
We estimated associations with a 1-log10 increase in coliphage
or enterococci levels with reference levels of −1 CFU/100 ml
(log10(0.1)) for enterococci and −1 PFU/100 ml for coliphage
corresponding to nondetects. We stratified coliphage analyses
by EPA Method because levels from EPA 1601 and 1602 are
not directly comparable. Because the number of beaches contributing to each coliphage analysis varied by coliphage type
and detection method, we repeated enterococci analyses for
the subset of beaches included in each coliphage analysis to
ensure comparability.
We estimated CIRs among swimmers using log-linear, modified Poisson models with robust standard errors to
account for clustering within households.59 To estimate 95%
confidence bands for the probability of illness across levels
of coliphage and enterococci, we used a nonparametric bootstrap with 1,000 replicates. We adjusted statistical models for
the following potential confounders, consistent with previous
studies5,7,8,50,51,55: age; sex; race (white vs. not white); chronic
gastrointestinal illness; contact with a person with gastrointestinal illness at enrollment; contact with any animals; and
consumption of undercooked or raw eggs, meat, or fish in the
3 days before enrollment. We did not adjust for sand contact
because it could be a mediator of the effect of coliphage on
illness.60 Models included fixed effects for each beach.61 With
the exception of age, which was coded as a categorical variable, we coded all potential confounders as binary (yes/no).
We assessed effect modification by whether conditions were
human-impacted. Our analysis excluded individuals with
missing outcomes and assumed they were missing at random
conditional on covariates in our model. We excluded individuals who had gastrointestinal illness in the 3 days before enrollment to ensure the analysis included incident episodes. We
conducted a log-linear trend test to assess whether gastrointestinal illness risk increased linearly from (1) not swimming, (2)
swimming with no coliphage exposure, (3) swimming with
exposure to coliphage, to (4) swimming with exposure to coliphage and enterococci >35 CFU/100 ml.62

Secondary Analyses
We conducted secondary analyses with alternative exposure and outcome and reference group definitions to assess the
robustness of our findings. First, we estimated CIRs using nonswimmers as the reference group. Second, to assess whether

greater water exposure had stronger associations with illness,
we estimated CIRs among swimmers who immersed their
head and who swallowed water. Third, we estimated CIRs for
diarrhea instead of gastrointestinal illness. Finally, to detect
residual confounding and/or differential outcome reporting
bias, we conducted a negative control analysis among nonswimmers,63,64 expecting that coliphage presence assigned
to nonswimmers would not be associated with increased illness among nonswimmers if no such confounding occurred.
Finally, because the number of samples collected per day varied between beaches, our categorization of coliphage presence/
absence may have diluted CIRs by ignoring the frequency of
coliphage detection each day. We estimated the association
between illness and swimming on days when >25% of samples
contained detectable coliphage compared with days when no
coliphage was detected. We repeated this analysis for days
when >50% and >75% of samples had detectable coliphage.

RESULTS
Study Population
The studies enrolled 7,317 beachgoers at Avalon, 11,719
at Doheny, 7,254 at Malibu, 12,469 at Mission Bay, 2,977 at
Goddard, and 2,022 at Fairhope Beach. Forty-four percent of
beachgoers entered the water to waist depth or deeper and were
classified as swimmers (eTable 5; http://links.lww.com/EDE/
B203). The percentage of swimmers who swallowed water at
each beach ranged from 7% to 14%. The self-reported average
time in the water among people with any water contact at each
beach ranged from 46 to 118 minutes.

Water Quality
A total of 1,818 water samples were analyzed for coliphage across the six beaches. Somatic coliphage (EPA 1601)
was detected in 42%–81% of samples across beaches; somatic
coliphage (EPA 1602) was detected in 27%–54% of samples;
male-specific coliphage (EPA 1601) was detected in 11%–
64% of samples, and male-specific coliphage (EPA 1602)
was detected in 2%–3% of samples (Table 1). At Avalon and
Doheny beaches, the only beaches where assays were run for
both somatic and male-specific coliphage, the geometric mean
of somatic coliphage levels was higher than for male-specific
coliphage. Combining data from Avalon and Doheny, the
geometric mean for somatic coliphage was 1.3 MPN/100 ml
(SD = 99) for EPA 1601 and 1.3 MPN/100 ml (SD = 22) for
EPA 1602; the geometric mean for male-specific coliphage was
0.6 MPN/100 ml (SD = 4) for EPA 1601 and 1.0 MPN/100 ml
(SD = 2) for EPA 1602. The geometric mean of each type of
coliphage was similar whether or not conditions were humanimpacted except for male-specific coliphage (EPA 1601), for
which the geometric mean was 1.34 MPN/100 ml when conditions were human-impacted and 0.88 MPN/100 ml otherwise
(eTable 6; http://links.lww.com/EDE/B203).
When enterococci levels were >35 CFU/100 ml,
somatic coliphage (EPA 1601 or 1602) was detected in 78%

somatic coliphage and 0.013 for male-specific coliphage.

Association Between Coliphage and
Gastrointestinal Illness
Threshold Analysis
Approximately 75% (N = 10,678) and 65% (N = 14,422)
of body immersion swimmers swam in waters where somatic
and male-specific coliphage, respectively, were present. Under
human-impacted conditions, coliphage presence was associated with increased gastrointestinal illness (Figure 2, eTable
7; http://links.lww.com/EDE/B203); the CIR was 1.39 (95%
confidence interval [CI] 0.95, 2.03) for somatic coliphage
and 1.28 (95% CI 0.83, 1.97) for male-specific coliphage.
Results were similar when we stratified by EPA 1601 and 1602
(eFigure 2; http://links.lww.com/EDE/B203). This was similar to the pattern for the enterococci threshold analysis (>35
CFU/100 ml), where we observed no association with illness
under not-human-impacted conditions, but an association
with illness was present under human-impacted conditions.
We found no evidence of increased gastrointestinal illness
associated with the joint indicator for the coliphage presence

and enterococci levels >35 CFU/100 ml under not humanimpacted conditions or across all conditions (Figure 2, eTable
7; http://links.lww.com/EDE/B203). However, there was an
association under human-impacted conditions: the CIR for
somatic coliphage presence and enterococci >35 CFU/100 ml
was 1.83 (95% CI 1.19, 2.82), and the CIR for male-specific
coliphage presence and enterococci >35 CFU/100 was 1.48
(95% 1.04, 2.11) relative to days when coliphage was absent
and enterococci was <35 CFU/100 ml.

Continuous Analysis
Neither somatic coliphage level (PFU 100/ml) measured by EPA 1601 nor enterococci level (CFU/100 ml)
measured at the same subset of beaches was associated with
gastrointestinal illness. At the two beaches where somatic
coliphage level was measured with EPA 1602, illness risk
increased as the level of coliphage or enterococci increased
under human-impacted conditions (Table 2, eFigure 3;
http://links.lww.com/EDE/B203): for coliphage, the CIR
for a 1-log10 increase was 1.27 (95% CI 0.92, 1.76), and for
enterococci it was 1.21 (95% CI 1.01, 1.46). Under humanimpacted conditions, there was no association with illness
for male-specific coliphage (EPA 1601) or enterococci levels
(Table 2, eFigure 4; http://links.lww.com/EDE/B203). Under
human-impacted conditions, the association with illness was
stronger for male-specific coliphage (EPA 1602) levels than
for enterococci levels, but the CIs overlapped substantially:
the CIR for a 1-log10 increase in male-specific coliphage
(EPA 1602) was 2.20 (95% CI 1.30, 3.71); for enterococci
levels measured at the same two beaches, the CIR was 1.21
(95% CI 1.01, 1.46).

Secondary Analyses
Our secondary analyses produced similar results to our
primary analysis and in some cases associations were stronger. Using nonswimmers as the reference group, CIRs were
slightly higher than when using swimmers not exposed to
coliphage as the reference (eFigure 5; http://links.lww.com/
EDE/B203). CIRs for swimmers who immersed their head
and swallowed water were similar under not human-impacted
conditions; under human-impacted conditions, associations
were stronger than for swimmers, and somatic coliphage was
associated with a 1.70-fold increase in gastrointestinal illness
risk (95% CI 1.07, 2.69) for head immersion swimmers and
3.08-fold increase in risk (95% CI 1.40, 6.78) for swimmers
who swallowed water. CIRs for diarrhea were similar overall
to those for gastrointestinal illness and slightly higher under
human-impacted conditions. Our negative control analysis
among nonswimmers found no association with coliphage
presence (eFigures 6–8; http://links.lww.com/EDE/B203).
Our analysis using indicators for whether >25%, >50%, or
>75% of samples per day contained detectable coliphage
produced similar results to the threshold analysis (eFigure 9;
http://links.lww.com/EDE/B203).

Somatic coliphage was measured using EPA Method 1601 at Avalon, Doheny, and Mission Bay. Only one beach was included in this analysis because Mission Bay was always
classified as not human-impacted, and there were no water samples from Doheny that were collected on days classified as human-impacted for this indicator. Thus, these analyses are
for Avalon beach only.

DISCUSSION
For both coliphage and enterococci, associations with
gastrointestinal illness were only observed under humanimpacted conditions. Under those conditions, we found some
evidence that the gastrointestinal illness risk associated with a
log10 increase in male-specific coliphage was greater than the
risk associated with a log10 increase in culturable enterococci.
Somatic coliphage and enterococci results were similar. Associations between coliphage presence and illness were stronger
when we examined swimmers who immersed their head or
swallowed water. Prior studies have also primarily found associations between illness and coliphage48,49,52,53,56 or enterococci7,8,50,55,58,65 when human fecal pollution was present. A
possible explanation for this pattern is that few pathogens
were present when there were no known sources of human
fecal contamination (not human-impacted conditions). We
found a slightly stronger association with gastrointestinal illness for the joint indicator for coliphage presence plus enterococci levels >35 CFU/100ml compared with the associations
for single indicators (Figure 2). When enterococci levels were
≤35 CFU/100 ml, coliphage was detected in the majority of
samples, indicating that viruses may be present below the
water quality monitoring criterion level for enterococci.
We found no difference in the association with gastrointestinal illness for somatic and male-specific coliphage, which
is inconsistent with several previous studies. Two studies that
compared illness associations for both types of coliphage, datasets from which were included in this analysis, found stronger associations with illness for male-specific than somatic
coliphage.50,51 There are biologic reasons why male-specific
coliphage might have a stronger association with illness. Both
types of coliphage have morphologic features similar to different types of enteric pathogens found in recreational water,
although male-specific coliphages are morphologically similar
to a larger number of enteric viruses than somatic coliphages.46
Some studies have found that male-specific coliphages have
a stronger association with pathogens21; for adenovirus there
was a stronger association with male-specific coliphage than
somatic coliphage. Enterococci were also not associated with
any viral pathogen. In this analysis, data from additional
beaches beyond those analyzed in past studies50,51 were available for male-specific but not somatic coliphage. It is possible
that if somatic coliphage data were available from additional
beaches that we would have seen a difference in illness associations between the two types of coliphage.
We found that coliphage detected using EPA 1602 had
a slightly stronger association with illness than coliphage
detected using EPA 1601. EPA 1601 includes an enrichment
step that may mask certain strains of coliphage, and as a result
this method may fail to capture the diversity of coliphage strains
in a sample.47 Thus, it is possible that EPA 1602, which does not
include an enrichment step, is better able to capture the range
of coliphages associated with enteric viruses than EPA 1601,
which may have led to stronger associations with illness.

Our study includes several limitations typical of a prospective cohort design in which swimmers are not randomly
assigned to enter the water with different levels of coliphage
or enterococci, creating the potential for unmeasured confounding. However, our negative control analysis among
nonswimmers found no association with coliphage presence,
indicating that any residual confounding or differential outcome reporting bias was unlikely to explain the associations
estimated in this study.63,64 Observational studies are also subject to misclassification due to self-reporting of exposures and
outcomes; we would expect outcome misclassification to be
independent of coliphage levels (i.e., nondifferential), which
would have biased results toward a null finding.66,67
Our finding that the association between coliphage and
gastrointestinal illness was not much stronger under all conditions than the association for culturable enterococci could
have resulted from two study design attributes that could have
caused associations to be underestimated. First, the data we
analyzed detected coliphage in 100 ml volumes that are typically used for quantifying enterococci. This volume might be
appropriate for routine beach monitoring because clogging
of filters can be problematic using higher volumes. However,
that volume may be suboptimal for assessing the association
between coliphage and illness because coliphage occurs at
lower densities than enterococci in the human intestine. Using
larger volume methods such as dead-end hollow-tube fiber
cartridges that improve detection of coliphage68 might have
resulted in fewer nondetects, a more accurate exposure classification, and possibly a stronger association between coliphage and illness.

CONCLUSIONS
This pooled analysis is the largest evaluation to date
of the association between coliphage in recreational water
and gastrointestinal illness. We found an increased cumulative incidence of gastrointestinal illness among swimmers
in waters with detectable coliphage when human fecal contamination was likely present, but not otherwise. Compared
with associations with enterococci, associations were similar for somatic coliphage, and there was some evidence for a
stronger association with male-specific coliphage. This study
highlights the potential utility of coliphage as a predictor of
gastrointestinal illness when human fecal contamination is
likely present. Given the paucity of data on different coliphage
types, coliphages should be included in future ambient recreational water epidemiologic analyses.
