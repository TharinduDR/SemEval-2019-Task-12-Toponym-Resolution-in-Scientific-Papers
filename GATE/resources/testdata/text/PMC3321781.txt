To determine the lineage of West Nile virus that caused
outbreaks in Italy in 2008 and 2009, several West Nile
virus strains were isolated from human specimens and
sequenced. On the basis of phylogenetic analyses, the
strains isolated constitute a distinct group within the western
Mediterranean cluster.
West Nile virus (WNV) is an arthropod-borne
flavivirus affecting a wide range of vertebrates,
including birds and mammals. The natural cycle of
infection involves birds and mosquitoes (1); many species
of wild birds act as amplifying hosts, whereas humans and
horses are considered dead-end hosts (2). First identified in
tropical Africa, WNV infection has been found in northern
Africa, Israel, India, and Australia (3) and has progressively
spread in the Americas since 1999 (4,5). WNV has been the
cause of outbreaks and sporadic cases in central, eastern,
and Mediterranean Europe for >45 years (6). Most strains
responsible for the European and Mediterranean basin
outbreaks are in lineage 1, with most grouped in the so-
called European Mediterranean/Kenyan cluster (7,8).
In August 2008, an outbreak involving wild birds,
horses, and humans affected 8 provinces in 3 regions in
Italy (Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, Lombardy) (9,10). In
2009, a new epidemic was reported in the same region
and in other neighboring regions in Italy, with up to 17
confirmed human cases of West Nile neuroinvasive
disease (11).
The Study
We obtained nucleotide sequences of the envelope (E)
and nonstructural (NS)3/NS5 protein regions of 6 WNV
human strains isolated during the 2008–2009 outbreaks
in Italy and analyzed their phylogenetic relationships with
otherWNVstrainsisolatedinEuropeandtheMediterranean
basin. Virus isolation on Vero E6 cells was performed
from human serum samples obtained from patients with
neuroinvasive WNV infection: 5 samples were collected
during the 2009 outbreak from patients residing in the
provinces of Ferrara (2 patients), Modena (1), and Mantua
(2); 1 sample was collected during the 2008 outbreak from
a patient living in Ferrara. Cytopathic effects were observed
6 days after the serum was injected into cell cultures; WNV
infection was identified by immunofluorescence staining
and confirmed by real-time reverse transcription–PCR (9).
Virus isolates were designed as follows: TOS-09
(Ferrara), NAL-09 (Ferrara), CHI-09 (Mantua), BAL-09
(Mantua), FAN-09 (Modena), and MAN-08 (Ferrara). After
1 passage, supernatants of infected tissue cultures were
processed for viral RNA extraction and PCR amplification.
Nucleotide sequences were obtained for the E gene (1,503
nt) and for a region of 5,759 nt encompassing the NS3,
NS4a, NS4b, and NS5 genes, which are considered to
be the most phylogenetic informative regions (12,13).
Overlapping amplicons were amplified and bidirectionally
sequenced. Primer sequences are available upon request.
Multiple alignments of the 6 new WNV sequences
of E and NS3/NS5 regions, along with the corresponding
sequences from 30 other WNV strains and isolates
available in GenBank and Usutu virus as outgroup virus,
were generated by using ClustalW software (www2.ebi.
ac.uk/clustalw). Phylogenetic analyses of the E (Figure
1) and NS3/NS5 (Figure 2) sequences generated highly
comparable topologies and confirmed that strains from Italy
and all western Mediterranean strains belonging to lineage
1, clade 1a, were highly related. In addition, on the basis
of the phylogenetic trees of E and NS3/NS5 sequences,
we found that the 6 new sequences clustered with other
strains isolated in Italy in 2008 and 2009, constituting a
distinct and well-supported group within the western
Mediterranean cluster (100% bootstrap on E and NS3/NS5
regions) (Figures 1, 2).
For the E gene, the mean genetic distance within the 6
new isolates from Italy was 0.08% at the nucleotide level,
whereas the derived amino acid sequences were totally
conserved. For the NS3/NS5 region, the mean genetic
distance within the 6 new isolates from Italy was 0.10% at
the nucleotide and amino acid levels.
Within the 2008–2009 cluster from Italy, the 6
newly sequenced human strains exhibited a 0.14% mean
nucleotide distance with the 2 strains isolated in the Emilia
Romagna region in 2008 from magpies (Italy 15803/08 and
Italy 15217/08) and 0.15% with the first human WNV strain
isolated in Italy in 2009 (Italy/09) in the Veneto region (14),

in the E and NS3/NS5 genomic regions. On the basis of
NS3/NS5 sequences, all strains from Italy isolated during
the 2008–2009 outbreaks showed the highest relatedness
to Morocco/03, France/04, and Portugal/04 with 1.08%,
1.28%, and 1.45% mean nucleotide distance, respectively,
whereas they show a mean nucleotide distance of 1.56%
with Italy/98. The close relatedness to Morocco/03,
France/04, and Portugal/04 was also confirmed on E gene
sequences (1.44%, 1.51%, and 1.17% mean nucleotide
distance, respectively), compared with a mean nucleotide
distance of 2.06% with Italy/98.
Comparison of the amino acid sequences of the E and
NS3/NS5 region showed that all 2008–2009 strains from
ItalyexhibitasetofaminoacidsubstitutionsintheNS4aand
NS5 proteins not shared with other western Mediterranean
strains that could be considered as molecular signatures,
e.g., I2209 and S2224 in the NS4a protein, A2786 and
K2950 in the NS5 protein (online Appendix Table, www.
cdc.gov/EID/content/17/5/903-appT.htm). No relevant
amino acid changes were observed in the E region.
Notably, the NS3 Thr249Pro substitution, suggested
to be associated with increased virulence for American
crows (15), was not uniformly present in all the 2008–2009
isolates in Italy. It was detected in all 2008 isolates, but
heterogeneously distributed among the 2009 isolates. In
particular, among the newly sequenced strains, P at NS3–
249 was present in the BAL-09, FAN-09, and MAN-08
isolates, whereas T was present in the TOS-09, NAL-09,
and CHI-09 isolates. Thus, this substitution could not be
considered a hallmark of the well-defined 2008–2009
cluster in Italy.
Conclusions
Although in the past decades several outbreaks of WNV
infection have occurred in Europe and in the Mediterranean
Basin (6), few viral isolates and nucleotide sequences are
available from this geographic area, thus preventing an
in-depth analysis of the molecular epidemiology of West
Nile infection in the region. We provide 6 new nucleotide
sequences of the E and NS3/NS5 regions from WNV
strains isolated in 2008–2009 from patients in Italy with
West Nile neuroinvasive disease and describe the isolates’
phylogenetic relationships with other WNV strains in the
Western Mediterranean cluster.
The analysis of the E and NS3/NS5 sequences
enabled a new phylogenetic reconstruction of the Western
Mediterranean cluster, suggesting that the 2008–2009
strains from Italy constitute a distinct and well-supported
group within the European–Mediterranean clade,
characterized by specific amino acid changes in NS4a and
NS5 proteins. The structure of phylogenetic trees, together
with the presence of amino acid signatures, is consistent
with a common origin of the strains circulating 2008–2009,
supporting the concept of endemic circulation of WNV in
Italy (6).
Furthermore, the T249P change in WNV-NS3 helicase
has been suggested as increasing the virulence of WNV in
birds in North America (15), although recent data do not

support this hypothesis (8). Our results indicate that, at least
in 2009 in Italy, there was a co-circulation of WNV strains
carrying either a P or a T in this position. On the basis of
our study, it is not possible to establish whether this was
because of different virus introductions in Italy or reversion
of some originally mutated strains. However, our findings
do not support the hypothesis that the recent emergence
of this mutation might have contributed to rapid spread of
WNV infection with the occurrence of human cases in the
Mediterranean Basin. More accurate studies are required to
define the role of the T249P mutation in the pathogenesis
and evolutionary history of WNV in recent outbreaks.
