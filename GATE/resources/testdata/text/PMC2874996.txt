ABSTRACT
In April 2009, a new influenza A (H1N1 2009) virus
emerged that rapidly spread around the world.
While current variants of this virus have caused
widespread disease, particularly in vulnerable
groups, there remains the possibility that future
variants may cause increased virulence, drug resis-
tance or vaccine escape. Early detection of these
virus variants may offer the chance for increased
containment and potentially prevention of the
virus spread. We have developed and field-tested a
resequencing kit that is capable of interrogating
all eight segments of the 2009 influenza A(H1N1)
virus genome and its variants, with added focus
on critical regions such as drug-binding sites,
structural components and mutation hotspots. The
accompanying base-calling software (EvolSTAR)
introduces novel methods that utilize neigh-
bourhood hybridization intensity profiles and substi-
tution bias of probes on the microarray for mutation
confirmation and recovery of ambiguous base
queries. Our results demonstrate that EvolSTAR is
highly accurate and has a much improved call rate.
The high throughput and short turn-around time
from sample to sequence and analysis results (30 h
for 24 samples) makes this kit an efficient large-
scale evolutionary biosurveillance tool.
BACKGROUND
While the current inﬂuenza A H1N1 2009 virus is
known to be sensitive to neuraminidase-inhibitor chemo-
prophylaxis, it has limited diversity at neutralizing
antibody binding sites and overall mortality rates compa-
rable with seasonal inﬂuenza (1); variations at numerous
sites within the inﬂuenza A genome are predicted to alter
these characteristics, with potentially important conse-
quences for healthcare provision.
In order to enable large-scale identiﬁcation of variations
of H1N1(2009) viruses from multiple patient samples, it is
necessary to develop a low-cost method for rapidly whole-
genome sequencing the H1N1 samples. Historically,
sequencing of viral genomes is performed using stan-
dard dye termination technologies. These conventional
sequencing technologies produce accurate data but are
too slow, costly and labour-intensive to be practical for
large-scale epidemiologic or evolutionary investigations in
viral outbreaks. Oligonucleotide resequencing microarrays
that are capable of identifying nucleotide sequence
variants may oﬀer an alternative solution (2,3) and in
recent years, have been used for detecting and subtyping
inﬂuenza viruses (4,5). By analysing sequences generated
from tiling probes across targeted regions of various
strains of the inﬂuenza virus [e.g. partial fragments of
the haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA)
genes], important information such as viral subtypes,
lineages and sequence variants can be determined. Apart
from inﬂuenza, resequencing microarrays have also been
used to obtain whole-genome primary sequences for
orthopoxviruses (6), biothreat viruses (7) and SARS (8).
The reported studies mainly use platform accompanying
software that employs probabilistic base-calling algo-
rithms such as ABACUS (3) and Nimblescan PBC (8).
Although statistically sound, these methods are suscepti-
ble to hybridization noise caused by factors such as poor
probe quality, poor ampliﬁcation or mutations. This
results in numerous ambiguous and false positive base
calls that may aﬀect the accuracy of downstream evolu-
tionary analysis. Eﬀorts have been made to improve the
call rates and accuracies of existing probabilistic
base-calling algorithms. For example, Model-P uses
probe and sequence features to build intensity-prediction
models that compute maximum likelihood scores for

base-calling (9). Another approach ﬁlters low-conﬁdence
base calls from problematic regions (e.g. regions with high
mutation rates or repeats), thereby reducing the number
of false-positive base calls (10). Depending on the strin-
gencies of the ﬁlters used, call rates may suﬀer as a result.
To address if these arrays can be used as a practical,
large-scale re-sequencing tool, we have developed a system
comprising customized sequence ampliﬁcation primers, a
12-plex DNA resequencing array and an automated
base-calling and variant analysis software (EvolSTAR).
We demonstrate that the sequences obtained from the
array are highly reproducible with 99.99% accuracy
and 99.02 ± 0.82% genome coverage. The short turn-
around time from sample to sequence and analysis
results (30 h for 24 samples) makes this kit an eﬃcient
large-scale evolutionary surveillance tool.
This article describes the development of the various
genetic analysis components, and their validation
using clinical samples. Accession numbers for 84
complete H1N1(2009) genomes generated are listed in

MATERIALS AND METHODS
RNA isolation and ampliﬁcation of patient isolates
Viral RNA from the diagnostic swabs or RNA extracted
from MDCK cell cultures was extracted using the DNA
minikit (Qiagen, Inc, Valencia, CA, USA) according to
manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was reverse-transcribed
to cDNA using customized random primers designed
using LOMA (11) and then ampliﬁed by PCR using pro-
prietary H1N1(2009) speciﬁc primers. The presence of
H1N1(2009) in the samples was conﬁrmed using a
separate real-time PCR assay based on the published
primer sequences from the Centre for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC), USA.
Design of probes in mutation hotspots
We found 36 mutation hotspots in the alignments where
mutations occurred near one another (within 20 bp).
A perfect match (PM) probe residing in a mutation
hotspot may contain mismatches that will have
a detrimental eﬀect on its hybridization intensity.
To avoid this problem, we designed additional PM
probes that contain all possible combinations of muta-
tions found in each mutation hotspot. Thus, if two muta-
tions are found within 20 bp of each other in the
alignments, then we need in total four (22
) PM probes to
encode them. In general, 2x
PM probes are needed to
completely encode a cluster of x mutations that occur
within 20 bp of one another in the alignments.
Determination of neighbourhood hybridization intensity
proﬁle types
We have identiﬁed ﬁve distinct types of neighbourhood
hybridization intensity proﬁle belonging to true non-
mutations (wild-type), true mutations, isolated errors/
‘N’s, long consecutive errors/‘N’s, and unknown errors/
‘N’s, respectively. For each non-high-conﬁdence query
base, we determine the type of its neighbourhood hybrid-
ization signal intensity proﬁle (NHIP) by the following
criteria:
(i) True-non-mutation—The PM probe (of both
strands) of the query base must be a high-conﬁdence
call [i.e. it has hybridization intensity  1.4-fold that
of its mismatch (MM) probes]. Neighbourhood PM
probes are also high-conﬁdence calls. Let the mean
hybridization intensity of the three nearest PM
probes to the immediate left of the mutation base
(at position 1, 2 and 3), denoted as {1,2,3},
the mean hybridization intensity of the three PM
probes to the far left of the mutation base (at
position 4, 5 and 6), denoted as {4,5,6},
the mean hybridization intensity of the three
nearest PM probes to the immediate right of the
mutation base (at position 1, 2 and 3), denoted as
{1,2,3}, and the mean hybridization intensity of the
three PM probes to the far right of the mutation
base (at position 4, 5 and 6), denoted as {4,5,6}.
We impose that {1,2,3}  {4,5,6} and
{1,2,3}  {4,5,6}
(ii) True-mutation—The PM probe (of both strands) of
the query base must have hybridization inten-
sity  1.4-fold that of its MM probes. To detect
the characteristic dip, we check four mean hybrid-
ization intensities: the mean hybridization intensity
of the three nearest PM probes to the immediate left
of the mutation base (at position 1, 2 and 3),
denoted as {1,2,3}, the mean hybridization
intensity of the three PM probes to the far left of
the mutation base (at position 4, 5 and 6),
denoted as {4,5,6}, the mean hybridization
intensity of the three nearest PM probes to
the immediate right of the mutation base (at
position 1, 2 and 3), denoted as {1,2,3}, and the
mean hybridization intensity of the three PM
probes to the far right of the mutation base (at
position 4, 5 and 6), denoted as {4,5,6}. If
{1,2,3} < {4,5,6} and {1,2,3} < {4,5,6}, we
say this is a dip pattern and the query base is
likely to be mutated.
(iii) Isolated error/‘N’—The PM probe (of both strands)
of the query base has hybridization intensity < 1.4-
fold that of its MM probes. Neighbourhood PM
probes are high-conﬁdence calls.
(iv) Long consecutive errors/‘N’s—The PM probe (of
both strands) of the query base has hybridization
intensity < 1.4-fold that of its MM probes. A
majority of neighbourhood PM probes are non-
high-conﬁdence calls.
(v) Unknown error/‘N’—All other neighbourhood
hybridization proﬁle patterns that do not fall
under the previous categories.
Computing the likelihood in nucleotide substitution
bias analysis
We deﬁne that a probe encodes the base b if b is located in
the centre-most position of the probe and is the base to be

interrogated. For a given query base, suppose the PM
probe encodes b1 while the MM probes encode b2,
b3 and b4, respectively, where {b1, b2, b3, b4} = {A, C, G,
T} and the hybridization intensity reduction order
is b1b2b3b4. To validate if the observed PM probe
encoding b1 is indeed the true PM probe of the sample
sequence, we compute the likelihood ratio of fobs and frand,
where fobs is probability of observing the hybridization
intensity reduction order b1b2b3b4 given that the PM
probe encodes b1 and frand is the probability of observing
the hybridization intensity reduction order b1b2b3b4 by
chance. Precisely,

where #(wxyz) is the number of observed hybridiza-
tion intensity reduction orders from high-conﬁdence
base-calls and t is the total number of hybridization inten-
sity reduction orders excluding b1b2b3b4 obtained from
high-conﬁdence base-calls. If the likelihood ratio >2, we
expect that the observed PM probe encoding b1 is indeed
the true PM probe of the sample sequence.
EvolSTAR two-step process
EvolSTAR employs a two-step process for base-calling
(Figure 1). In the ﬁrst step, each base query is scrutinized
for signs of hybridization intensity abnormalities. If
the gain-of-signal of the query base is strong and has no
mutation, the base is called. In the second step, EvolSTAR
then tries to recover base queries that have any hybridiza-
tion intensity abnormalities with two analysis methods,
namely neighbourhood hybridization intensity proﬁle
analysis and nucleotide substitution bias analysis.
Step 1: Identiﬁcation of base queries with ambiguity. On
our array platform, the hybridization intensity of each
probe is given by the mean and standard deviation of
the ﬂuorescence intensities of nine individually scanned
pixels. Hence, we deﬁne the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
of a probe as the ratio of the mean to the standard devi-
ation of the intensities of the nine pixels associated with
the probe. In our experiments, we found that >95% of all
probes had SNR less than TSNR (TSNR = mSNR + 2sSNR,
where mSNR and sSNR are the mean and standard devia-
tion of SNR of all probes on the array). The remaining
5% of probes with SNR  TSNR are unreliable. Hence,
base queries with one or more probes with SNR  TSNR
are analysed further in step 2. Furthermore, all base
queries whose PM probe in the forward strand and PM
probe in the reverse strand are non-complementary, or
have weak PM/MM hybridization intensity diﬀerentiation
Figure 1. FlowChart of EvolSTAR. FlowChart of EvolSTAR. Bold arrows are ‘Yes’ paths, while normal arrows are ‘No’ paths. In the ﬁrst step,
each base query is scrutinized for signs of hybridization intensity abnormalities. Base queries with hybridization intensity abnormalities are passed to
step 2 for further analysis.
PAGE 3 OF 14 Nucleic Acids Research, 2010, Vol. 38, No. 9 e111
(<1.4-fold) are also passed to step 2. Lastly, we also pass
all putative mutation calls to step 2 for conﬁrmation.
Step 2: Mutation conﬁrmation and base query recovery. A
high-conﬁdence mutation call may be a result of coinci-
dental non-speciﬁc hybridization of the same MM probe
in both strands. As such, it may be inadequate to discern
true mutations based solely on diﬀerences in the hybrid-
ization intensities of PM and MM probes. From our
analysis of true-mutation calls made by PBC, we have
found that true mutations have a signature NHIP type
as per described in Figure 2b. Thus, query bases that
result in a mutation call must have this signature NHIP.
Finally, to conﬁrm the mutation, we perform nucleotide
substitution bias analysis on these query bases. For each
of the query bases with NHIP of type described in
Figure 2b, we compute the likelihood ‘ that the
observed PM probe (representing the mutation) is
indeed the true PM probe of the sample sequence given
the hybridization intensity-based ordering of its MM
probes (see ‘Materials and methods’ section). If ‘ > 2,
the query base results in a strong mutation call (repre-
sented by upper case base calls ‘A’, ‘C’, ‘G’ or ‘T’). If
‘ > 1, the query base results in a mutation call with
weak support (represented by lower case base calls ‘a’,
‘c’, ‘g’ or ‘t’). Otherwise, they are re-assigned an
unknown ‘N’ call.
For query bases that results in a mutation call but have
NHIP of type described in Figure 2c, they are most likely
isolated errors caused by poor PM probe quality. Hence,
we correct the base-calls of these query bases to their
respective reference bases (but represented by lower case

the NHIP for ﬁve types of call: (a) true-non-mutation, (b) true-mutation, (c) isolated error or ‘N’, (d) long chains of consecutive errors or ‘N’, (e)
unknown error or ‘N’) based on their respective observed neighbourhood hybridization intensity proﬁles. The PM probe (red circle) of query base is
at position 0 while neighbourhood PM probes (black circles) are numbered according to their distance away from the query base. A PM probe is
signiﬁcantly diﬀerentiated from its MM probes if its hybridization intensity is at least t-fold that of all its MM probes.
e111 Nucleic Acids Research, 2010, Vol. 38, No. 9 PAGE 4 OF 14
base calls ‘a’, ‘c’, ‘g’ or ‘t’) in the reference sequences. We
also perform the same correction to non-high-conﬁdence
query bases with NHIP of type described in Figure 2c.
We try to recover the remaining query bases that have
NHIP of type described in Figure 2d or 2e by analysing
the substitution bias from their PM and MM probes in the
forward and reverse strands separately. Similar to how a
mutation is conﬁrmed, we compute the likelihood ‘f that
the observed PM probe (representing the unsure base call)
is indeed the true PM probe of the sample sequence given
the hybridization intensity-based ordering of its MM
probes in the forward strand. We also compute a similar
likelihood ‘r for the PM probe in the reverse strand. If the
PM probes in both strands are complementary and ‘f,
‘r > 2, the query base results in a strong base call (repre-
sented by upper case base calls ‘A’, ‘C’, ‘G’ or ‘T’).
However, in many cases, the PM probes in both strands
are not complementary due to non-speciﬁc hybridization
of MM probes in one or both strands. For such query
bases, we make base calls based on ‘f and ‘r: if ‘f > ‘r
and ‘f > 2, a base call with weak support (represented by
lower case base calls ‘a’, ‘c’, ‘g’ or ‘t’) is made from the PM
probe in the forward strand. Else, if ‘r > ‘f and ‘r > 2, a
base call with weak support is made from the PM probe in
the reverse strand. Otherwise, they are assigned an
unknown ‘N’ call.
Note that since nucleotide substitution biases may vary
depending on the experimental conditions, experimental
reagents or input samples, for each experiment, we
obtain a set of high-conﬁdence base-calls and use them
to infer the hybridization intensity reduction orders for
each PM probe encoding. This is then used to compute
likelihood scores for base-calling non-high-conﬁdence
query bases and mutation conﬁrmation.
RESULTS
Design of resequencing array
We generated a consensus sequence for each segment
of the H1N1(2009) virus by aligning all 1715 complete
and partial sequences available from the NCBI
H1N1 ﬂu resources database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih
.gov/genomes/FLU/SwineFlu.html) as of 11 June 2009
using MAFFT (12) with high-accuracy option.
Tiling probes spanning the entire genome segments on
both the forward and reverse strands were created at one
base resolution (8). Analysis of the sequence alignments
revealed that there were no deletions, insertions or recom-
bination. However, we found 36 mutation hotspots in the
alignments where mutations occurred near one another
(within 20 bp). Thus, we added additional probes that rep-
resent all possible combinations of mutations in these
mutation hotspots onto the array. To ensure that we
have accurate sequence of the drug binding pocket
targeted by NA inhibitors (13) such as oseltamivir
(TamiﬂuÕ
) and zanamivir (RelenzaÕ
) in the NA gene of
the H1N1(2009) virus, additional probes were added.
In total, the array contains 8236 control probes and
121 928 H1N1(2009) probes, which provides 2  coverage
of the entire H1N1(2009) genome, and up to 8  coverage
of the regions comprising the 36 mutation hotspots and 10
drug-binding sites (Supplementary Data File 2).
Optimization of RT–PCR primers and conditions
Due to the small amount of virus present in samples
relative to human or cell-line total RNA, it was necessary
to amplify the viral RNA through PCR. We employed a
combination of sequence-speciﬁc and random PCR
approaches using LOMA-optimized primers as previously
described (11). The addition of random primers ensured
complete genome ampliﬁcation, even if mutations were
present at the speciﬁc-primer binding sites. PCR condi-
tions were optimized by conducting ﬁve duplicate hybrid-
izations of the same virus sample cultured from a patient
sample under diﬀerent PCR conditions. The opti-
mized method was then tested on RNA isolated directly
from nasal swabs obtained from the same patient
and from virus grown in cell culture. Microarray
sequences generated from these replicate experiments
were compared with capillary sequencing to estimate
sequencing accuracy.
Algorithm for sequence determination
Following PCR product labelling, hybridization and scan-
ning, signal intensities for each probe was generated using
Genepix 4.0 software, and annotated using Nimblescan
2.5 software. Initially, the standard Nimblescan software
which employs a gain-of-signal approach [PBC algorithm
(8)], was used to determine the viral sequence. The PBC
algorithm assumes that the signal intensity of the PM
probe (which matches exactly to the sequence in the
sample) will be signiﬁcantly higher than that of the MM
probes. While this approach suﬃced for 90% of base
queries, we observed that the discrimination between the
PM and MM signals was not clear for the remaining
probes.
These ambiguous signals were caused by the presence of
multiple mutations in the probe sequence, homopolymers
and hybridization artefacts. We developed a novel algo-
rithm, Evolution Surveillance and Tracking Algorithm for
Resequencing arrays (EvolSTAR), to resolve this
problem. EvolSTAR improves upon PBC by adding an
analysis of the NHIP and nucleotide substitution bias
(described below).
NHIP
Due to the use of tiling probes in resequencing arrays, a
single nucleotide mutation at a particular query base could
cause a dramatic reduction in the hybridization intensities
of neighbouring PM probes up to six bases away (14). This
eﬀect can be measured by studying the NHIP of each
query base. We deﬁned the NHIP of each query base as
the observed pattern of hybridization intensities of its PM
and MM probes and neighbouring (±6 bases from query
base) PM and MM probes. To study the eﬀects of
sequence variation (mutation) and noise on the NHIP of
a query base, we sequenced RNA from H1N1(2009)
patient 380 by capillary sequencing and on duplicate
microarrays. We compared sequence calls generated
using by Nimblescan or by capillary sequencing and
PAGE 5 OF 14 Nucleic Acids Research, 2010, Vol. 38, No. 9 e111
compiled a list of true (correct) calls, error calls and ‘N’
(unknown) calls. In total, of the expected 13 588 bases
of the H1N1 virus (based on genome described at http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/taxg.cgi?tax=211044)
the microarray called 13 449 bases while capillary
sequence was able to call 12 832 bases.
Figure 3 shows the NHIPs of a representative set of 40
randomly selected query bases that result in true-non-
mutation calls (wild-type calls). We observed that in
these NHIPs, the PM probe of the query base together
with neighbouring PM probes, have hybridization
intensities signiﬁcantly higher (>1.4-fold) than that of
their MM probes in general. We also identiﬁed 10 muta-
tions using capillary sequencing in the patient sample. The
NHIPs of these 10 true-mutation calls (Figure 4) are very
diﬀerent from NHIPs of wild-type calls. The presence of a
mutation at the query base created a MM in neighbouring
PM probes and caused a drop in their hybridization
intensities. The closer this mutation is to the centre of a
neighbouring PM probe, the bigger the drop in hybridiza-
tion intensity. This results in a distinctive dip to the imme-
diate left and right of the centre of the NHIP where the
mutation is.
Unlike the NHIPs of wildtype and true-mutation calls,
the NHIPs of most errors and ‘N’ calls appear haphazard
(Figure 5). However, when we traced the locations of these
errors and ‘N’ calls on the genome, we found that some
are isolated among good calls while others are conjugated
in a small locality of the genome. We investigated the
NHIPs of isolated errors and ‘N’ calls that occurred
among good calls and found that in these NHIPs, only
the PM probe of the query base that is an error or ‘N’ call
has poor hybridization diﬀerentiation with its MM probes
while other PM probes have hybridization intensities
signiﬁcantly higher than that of their MM probes in
general (Figure 6). This suggests that for such calls, only
the PM and MM probes of the query base are noisy while
neighbouring PM and MM probes are unaﬀected.
In addition, we also found that long chains of consecutive
error and ‘N’ calls (especially at the 50
- and 30
-end of the
sample sequences) often have NHIPs where the PM probe
of the query base together with neighbouring PM probes,
have poor hybridization diﬀerentiation with their MM
probes (Figure 7). These error and ‘N’ calls usually
occur at the ends of the genome segments. In summary,
NHIP analysis showed that all true mutation calls had a
characteristic proﬁle (Figure 2b) that diﬀered from
wild-type sequence calls (Figure 2a). Ambiguous calls
arising from diﬀerent causes, such as homopolymers,
isolated errors and hybridization artifacts also have
proﬁles that are distinct from true mutation proﬁles
(Figure 2). See ‘Materials and Methods’ section for
details.
Nucleotide substitution bias
The presence of nucleotide substitution bias in Nimblegen
resequencing arrays has been previously described (15).
However, this knowledge has so far been used only to
improve probe design. In this article, we propose a novel
method that makes use of nucleotide substitution bias in
the array to improve base-calling accuracy and call rate.

true-non-mutation calls from patient sample 380. This representative set consists of ﬁve true-non-mutation calls randomly selected from each
segment. Each line represents the NHIP (±6 bp from query base position) of a true-non-mutation call.

The key idea is to build a likelihood model of the substi-
tution bias among the probes of non-ambiguous calls on
the array; then use this to call bases with ambiguous
signals.
To build the likelihood model, we ﬁrst determined the
substitution bias on our platform by comparing the PM
and MM probes (of both strands) of 25 028 true calls
made by PBC from the two replicate microarray experi-
ments of patient sample 380 mentioned in the previous
section. For each true call, we generated a hybridization
intensity reduction order by ranking the PM and MM
probes of a particular strand in decreasing order of

segment.

hybridization intensity and recording their respective
frequencies (Table 1). Table 1 shows that for each PM
probe encoding, certain hybridization intensity reduction
orders occur much more frequently than others. For
example, if the PM probe encoding is ‘A’ (regardless of
strand), then it is most likely that the hybridization inten-
sity reduction order is ‘TGC’ or ‘GTC’. Thus, by matching
the hybridization intensity reduction orders of its PM/
MM probes with that in Table 1, we can compute the
likelihood that the putative base call for a query base

error/‘N’ calls from patient sample 380. These errors are ﬂanked by true (correct) calls.

with ambiguous signals is correct (see ‘Materials and
Methods’ section). In this way, we can recover base calls
of ambiguous query bases exceeding a reasonably high
likelihood threshold and achieve better accuracy and call
rate than PBC.
Grading the quality of the sequence calls
EvolSTAR employs a two-step process for base-calling
(details in ‘Materials and methods’ section). First, it deter-
mines if the gain-of-signal from the PM probe is strong. If
strong, then the base sequence is called and annotated as
‘high quality’. If the gain-of-signal is ambiguous, or if the
base called is diﬀerent from the expected sequence, then
NHIP and nucleotide substitution bias is deployed to
verify the sequence call. From empirical experiments and
comparison with capillary sequence data, we observed
that high quality sequence calls are made when the
signal from the PM probe for both forward and reverse
strands are at least 40% higher than that of the MM
probes.
The second-step processes the ambiguous bases. For
bases conﬁrmed to be mutations through NHIP analysis
and satisfy the substitution bias rule, they are graded as
high quality sequence calls and denoted in the FASTA
sequence as UPPER CASE characters. For bases con-
ﬁrmed to be an isolated error through NHIP analysis
and also satisfy the substitution bias rule, they are
graded as low conﬁdence sequence calls and denoted in
the FASTA sequence in lower case characters. The rest of
the bases are called ‘N’ in the FASTA sequence. The ﬂow-
chart of EvolSTAR is shown in Figure 1.
Performance of EvolSTAR
To validate the software, we hybridized 14 patient samples
in duplicate onto the microarray. The microarrays were
analysed in parallel using Nimblescan (PBC algorithm)
and EvolSTAR, and the sequences obtained were
compared to Sanger capillary sequencing. We counted
the number of true-non-mutation calls, true-mutation
calls, error calls and ambiguous (‘N’) calls for both
methods (Table 2; Supplementary Data File 3). We also
conﬁrmed that the substitution bias in all 14 duplicate
hybridization experiments (Table 3) were consistent with
that found in Table 1. Compared with the available cap-
illary sequences for the 14 samples, EvolSTAR had an
average error rate of 0.0029% and 12 ambiguous calls
per sample (346 in total). This is far superior than
Nimblescan PBC, where we obtained an average error
rate of 0.083% and 158 ambiguous calls per sample
(4434 in total). Furthermore, EvolSTAR called all true
mutations correctly. The genome coverage attained by
EvolSTAR (99.02 ± 0.82%) is also much higher than
that of Nimblegen PBC (94.3 ± 6.06%).
We wondered if, and by how much, incorporating
NHIP and substitution biases analysis to the PBC
results would improve the performance of the PBC algo-
rithm. We observed that more than 70% of the 65 error
calls (false mutation calls) made by PBC did not have
the characteristic NHIP of a true-mutation shown in
Figure 2b. The remaining 30% of the error calls had a
NHIP reminiscent of a true-mutation NHIP but did not
satisfy the substitution bias rule. Using NHIP and substi-
tution biases analysis together, we were able to reduce the
number of false mutation calls to only two. Most of the
4434 ‘N’ calls made by PBC were due to conﬂicting base
calls from the forward and reverse strand. By analysing
the NHIP and hybridization intensity reduction order of
the query base in the forward and reverse strand individ-
ually, we were able to identify the noisy strand and hence,
make the base call only from the non-noisy strand. We
were able to recover 92% of the ‘N’ calls made by PBC
using this approach.
In addition, we evaluate the robustness and
reproducibility of EvolSTAR by employing six pairs of
replicate experiments consisting of one pair nasal swab
and ﬁve pairs of cell culture isolates, belonging to the
same patient sample 305 (Supplementary Data File 4).
Of the experiments, two pairs of replicates (305_nasal
and 305_cell_cond1) were ampliﬁed under the same
optimal experimental conditions while each of the other
pairs (305_cell_cond2, 305_cell_cond3, 305_cell_cond4,
305_cell_cond5) were ampliﬁed under diﬀerent sub-
optimal experimental conditions (simulating experimen-
tal volatility). Compared with the available capillary
sequences for sample 305, EvolSTAR had an average
error rate of 0.0012% and 28 ambiguous calls per
sample (338 in total). On the other hand, Nimblescan

Types of calls and their frequencies generated by EvolSTAR and PBC in replicated microarray hybridizations of 14 patient samples. Partial or
complete capillary sequences were generated for each sample and used to verify the calls made by EvolSTAR and PBC on each replicate. We then
count the frequency of true-non-mutation, true-mutation, error and ‘N’ calls in each replicate.
e111 Nucleic Acids Research, 2010, Vol. 38, No. 9 PAGE 10 OF 14
PBC obtained a relatively higher average error rate of
0.169% and 237 ambiguous calls per sample (2855 in
total). Our results showed that EvolSTAR is robust and
performs well when samples are prepared under
sub-optimal conditions. Even for nasal swab samples
that tend to have much less concentration of virus RNA
than cell cultures, EvolSTAR suﬀered only a slight drop in
performance compared to Nimblescan PBC.
In conclusion, we have shown that EvolSTAR is robust
and generates sequence calls of high accuracy and
reproducibility in this pilot study consisting of 40
microarray experiments. Meanwhile, eﬀorts will be put
in to continually evaluate EvolSTAR with more samples
and update it on a regular basis as the H1N1(2009)
inﬂuenza virus evolves.
Visualization of sequence calls
Besides a FASTA output of the virus sequence,
EvolSTAR generates a visualization map of the
sequence calls using a heat map based on the percentage
identity of the called sequence to the reference sequence
measured at 50 bp windows (Figure 8). The map template
consists of all eight segments of the 2009 inﬂuenza
A(H1N1) virus and the locations of known drug binding
sites (marked with green lines) on the NA gene. Locations
of all mutation calls are denoted by red triangles beneath
the heat map bar. Sequences that are of low coverage
(<90%) are automatically ﬂagged, and the overall PM/
MM discrimination ratio for each segment is displayed.
The heat map bar allows the technician to rapidly assess
the quality of the sequence data obtained from the
microarray and identify regions where PCR did not
work well, or presence of potential recombination/
reassortment events. Mutations, especially those in close
proximity to drug binding sites, can be quickly visualized.
Other details such as coverage, number of base calls suc-
cessfully made, number of mutations and number of ‘N’
calls for each sequence call are also shown on the visual-
ization map.
DISCUSSION
Traditional statistical and probabilistic sequence-calling
techniques ascertain that a base call is of high conﬁdence
if they exceed pre-deﬁned signiﬁcance or probability
thresholds. This approach works well for high-conﬁdence
base-calls but is inadequate to extract suﬃcient informa-
tion from noisy base-calls. It is also diﬃcult to determine
the validity of a mutation call purely based on the distri-
bution of hybridization intensities of its PM and MM
probes. In this work, we have described two new hybrid-
ization intensity analysis methods that enable us to
conﬁdently identify true mutations and recover some
noisy base calls. Compared to PBC, EvolSTAR has
achieved superior call rates and accuracies, especially in
low-concentration samples with high CT values. The
robustness of the base calls enables our approach to be
a practical large-scale evolutionary surveillance tool.
Although we are conﬁdent that our resequencing array
can successfully generate complete sequences for the
H1N1(2009) virus and its variants at the current stage,
we cannot rule out the possibility of reassortments
between the H1N1(2009) virus and other inﬂuenza
viruses. Clearly, our resequencing array cannot fully
sequence such events and will generate sequences with
poor quality and coverage of the reassorted segments.
To investigate the eﬀects of a reassortment event on our
array, we independently ampliﬁed segments 1, 2, 3, 5, 6
and 7 of the 2009 inﬂuenza A(H1N1) virus and segment 4
of a H3N2 inﬂuenza A virus, and hybridized them onto
our array. The visualization map of this experiment is
shown in Figure 9. As expected, the sequence call for
segment 4 [based on PM/MM probes from the segment
4 consensus of the 2009 inﬂuenza A(H1N1) virus] is poor
in quality and coverage. However, we observed that we
were able to get good base calls from region 1150–1547.
This region turns out to be the only signiﬁcantly similar
(70% matched) region between the segment 4 consensus of
the 2009 inﬂuenza A(H1N1) virus and segment 4 of a
H3N2 virus (CY039087). This shows that identifying
regions of high similarity between the 2009 inﬂuenza
A(H1N1) virus with other inﬂuenza viruses and checking
if these regions have good sequence calls may be a plau-
sible way of detecting reassortments. The drawback of this
approach is that it will fail to detect reassortment of

certain segments where there are no regions of high sim-
ilarity between the H1N1(2009) virus and the parental
inﬂuenza virus. It is also diﬃcult to annotate and diﬀer-
entiate every region that the H1N1(2009) virus and all
other inﬂuenza viruses share similarity with. We propose
an alternative approach to detect reassortments. By
analysing the PM/MM hybridization intensity fold-
change of high conﬁdence calls of all eight segments, we
found that the average PM/MM hybridization intensity
fold-change of high conﬁdence calls in segments 1, 2, 3,
5, 6 and 7 belonging to the 2009 inﬂuenza A(H1N1) virus
is 4.5 while the average PM/MM hybridization intensity
fold-change of high conﬁdence calls in segment 4
belonging to the H3N2 inﬂuenza A virus is only 1.9.
The most likely reason for this huge drop in the average
PM/MM hybridization intensity fold-change of high con-
ﬁdence calls is that the signal gained by most of the
segment 4 PM probes on our array are through
cross-hybridization to the segment 4 sequence of the
H3N2 inﬂuenza A virus, and thus much lower than
signal gained from true speciﬁc binding. Thus, by
computing and comparing the average PM/MM hybrid-
ization intensity fold-change of high conﬁdence calls in
each segment, we can identify potential reassortments in
a given H1N1(2009) virus sample. Virus samples with
possible reassortments can then be sequenced using

coverage of its sequence calls. The locations of all mutation calls made by EvolSTAR are represented by red triangles beneath the heat map bar.
Sequences with coverage <90% are automatically ﬂagged as ‘low coverage’. Other details such as coverage: percentage of base calls successfully
made, match: number of base calls that match the reference sequence i.e. non-mutation base calls, strong mismatch: number of high conﬁdence base
calls that do not match the reference sequence i.e. mutation base calls, weak mismatch: number of low-conﬁdence base-calls that do not match the
reference sequence i.e. mutation base calls and Ns: number of ‘N’ calls, for each sequence call are also shown on the visualization map.

capillary sequencing or customized reassortment
resequencing arrays.
So far, the sequence diversity of H1N1 2009 inﬂuenza
virus has been rather limited. From our analysis, it would
be possible to resequence all the published isolates
using this resequencing approach. However, as antigenic
drift is expected to occur, it is likely that the resequencing
array would need to be updated at least annually.
Updating the array requires only bioinformatics input,
and does not require any other additional manufacturing
costs. Thus, this combination of sample ampliﬁca-
tion primers, low-cost multiplex array and robust interpre-
tation software allows sustainable, rapid, large-scale
biosurveillance of the inﬂuenza H1N1(2009) virus.
From a broader perspective, this study has highlighted
the feasibility of using resequencing microarrays for
high-throughput full genome sequencing of viruses. In
our application, resequencing microarrays are relatively
low-cost, costing only a 10th that of a 454 run, and equiv-
alent to that of a traditional capillary sequencing run.
However, through multiplexing, our system can generate
full genomes of 24 diﬀerent H1N1(2009) samples in 30 h.
In comparison, capillary sequencing and next-generation
technologies such as 454 may obtain full genomes of only
one or two diﬀerent samples in the same time-frame. In
practice, capillary sequencing is labour-intensive and thus
impractical for large-scale full genome sequencing of
viruses in an outbreak. In our experience with the 454
system, much of the ampliﬁed material is still human (as
the bulk of the patient sample material is human RNA
with very little inﬂuenza RNA), requiring very deep
sequencing to obtain a complete ﬂu genome sequence,
with one compartment of a run not yielding suﬃcient
viral information. Furthermore, assembly of the

inﬂuenza A(H1N1) virus and segment 4 of a H3N2 inﬂuenza A virus, and hybridized them onto our array. As expected, the sequence call for
segment 4 [based on PM/MM probes from the segment 4 consensus of the 2009 inﬂuenza A(H1N1) virus] is poor in quality and coverage.

sequence fragments is required before any analysis can be
done. Any abnormalities or gaps in the assembly would
then require additional runs of 454, incurring more cost
and time. Hence, our approach based on resequencing
microarrays presents a cost-eﬀective and eﬃcient
solution for high-throughput full genome sequencing of
viruses.
