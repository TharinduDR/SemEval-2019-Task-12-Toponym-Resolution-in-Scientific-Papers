Two cases of febrile respiratory illness associated with untypeable influenza A virus were identified in
Southern California in March 2009. One was initially detected as influenza virus using an experimental
diagnostic device in a clinical trial, while the other was detected at a local reference lab using a diagnostic PCR
assay. In both cases, analyses yielded negative results for strain-specific tests targeting circulating strains of
influenza A virus (seasonal H1 and H3). These two samples became the first reported cases of the pandemic
2009/H1N1 influenza virus. The first reportable characterization was made from the second collected specimen
on 15 April 2009 at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention central lab using traditional culture and
sequencing methods. The novel nature of the strain and its apparent zoonotic origins were initially charac-
terized using the first collected specimen at the Naval Health Research Center in San Diego, CA, on 13 April
using an experimental molecular analysis tool, PCR electro-spray ionization-mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-
MS), designed to amplify PCR products from any strain of influenza virus and to generate informative
(phylogenetic) strain identifications through mass spectrometry of PCR amplicons. The ability of this high-
throughput tool to correctly identify both well-characterized and novel influenza strains offers the possibility
to integrate surveillance for emerging strains with on-site rapid diagnosis used for patient management,
shortening the times between the emergence of new strains, their detection and identification, and appropriate
public health response activities. Here we describe the initial characterization of the pandemic 2009/H1N1
influenza strain and discuss the possible roles of diagnostic tools with discovery potential.
On 28 March 2009, a throat swab specimen was collected
from a 9-year-old female with febrile respiratory illness (FRI)
in Imperial County, California. This sample was collected as
part of a U.S.-Mexico border respiratory disease surveillance
program collaboratively operated and supported by the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Early Warning
Infectious Disease Surveillance and Border Infectious Disease
Surveillance programs and the Naval Health Research Center
(NHRC). Two days later, a similar sample was collected from
a 10-year-old male who reported with FRI in San Diego
County, CA, during enrollment for a clinical trial being locally
administered by NHRC for a private company. Both samples
were initially identified as “untypeable” influenza A virus. In
the case of the 28 March sample, this diagnosis was made using
an in-house accredited (homebrew) universal influenza PCR
assay at NHRC. In the case of the 30 March sample, the initial
(unreportable) “untypeable influenza A” identification was
made at the point of care using an experimental diagnostic
device in the course of the trial (1, 13).
Aliquots of both samples were shipped through the CDC’s
Laboratory Response Network for reference lab testing and
typing, as required for otherwise uncharacterizable influenza-
positive samples (1, 13). Such samples could represent newly
emerging zoonotic influenza viruses, reassorted (shifted)
strains carrying novel antigens, or significantly divergent
(drifted) descendants of currently recognized strains, all of
which would be of critical importance to public health activi-
ties. Novel strains are uncharacterizable (and often undetect-
able) using currently common on-site testing methods (1, 5).
Further testing of untypeable samples at reference labs allows
discrimination between truly “novel” influenza viruses—strains
that are recognizably different from previously characterized
strains—and those that are simply “untypeable” due to low
sample quality, low titer, or other technical issues.
NHRC conducts research related to the application and
validation of emerging technologies designed to increase the
scope, informational content, or deployable nature of rapid
diagnostics. Among these emerging technologies are high-
throughput, rapid analysis methods capable of universal de-
tection and characterization of pathogens, regardless of pre-
vious strain characterization or novelty. These methods
include the T5000 Universal Biosensor (Ibis Biosciences,
Carlsbad, CA) (3, 4, 9, 13, 17, 18). NHRC has been involved
in testing this platform for several years and has conducted
published validations of its scope and discriminatory power
(17, 4). NHRC has also conducted published and unpub-
lished comparisons of its sensitivity and specificity in com-
parison with diagnostically accredited methods for the de-
tection of commonly circulating strains of influenza in throat
swabs (reference 17 and this study). The T5000 is capable of
detecting and characterizing very diverse influenza A sub-
types, including avian, human, and nonhuman mammalian

strains (17). The strategy by which this is achieved is briefly
described in Materials and Methods.
The T5000 technology is used at NHRC to characterize
otherwise untypeable or unidentifiable pathogens collected
from a variety of local, national, and worldwide surveillance
activities and to screen untypeable influenza A-positive clinical
samples for hazardous high-pathogenicity avian strains prior to
culture and further characterization. For the emergent 2009/
H1N1 influenza virus, this technology offered the first charac-
terization of a previously unrecognized influenza strain, dem-
onstrating this capability in a real-world case of novel pathogen
emergence. Existing Food and Drug Administration-cleared
rapid antigen assays were very insensitive to the new strain (5).
Other accredited and experimental point-of-care tests, includ-
ing the universal influenza A PCR tests used for detection at
NHRC and the real-time PCR assays used at the CDC’s ref-
erence laboratories, produced positive (but untypeable) results
(1). These results required further shipment and testing at
reference labs to elucidate and report their novelty, their mo-
lecular identity, and their apparent origin (1, 8).
In this paper we describe the results obtained from the first
molecular characterization of the 2009/H1N1 pandemic influ-
enza, performed using the T5000 PCR electro-spray ioniza-
tion-mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) platform. We also
present a summary of prospective validation data from NHRC
comparing this technology’s sensitivity and specificity for cir-
culating influenza virus with those of accredited diagnostic
PCR and culture-based methods. We present T5000 data from
an analysis of a sample containing trivalent live-attenuated
influenza vaccine to demonstrate the technology’s capability to
discriminate between novel influenza viruses and coinfections
of recognized strains, which can be difficult using existing se-
rological or sequencing methods in the absence of plaque pu-
rification and individual virus isolation. We describe the data
analysis leading to the ultimate interpretation that the detected
pathogen was a novel zoonotic reassortant, and we discuss the
possibility that rapid diagnostic technologies capable of both
detecting and characterizing novel agents may one day bring
surveillance for emerging pathogens to point-of-care facilities.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sample collection, initial processing, and shipping. One current area of
NHRC surveillance is the U.S.-Mexico border region between San Diego and
Imperial counties, administered in collaboration with the CDC. Another sur-
veyed population includes dependents of military servicemen and women in San
Diego County, part of a collaboration between the Naval Medical Research
Center and NHRC. In the course of these programs, throat swab samples are
collected from patients reporting to clinics with FRI (defined here as fever of
38°C or higher and cough or a sore throat). Swabs are placed in viral transport
medium (VTM) and frozen in liquid nitrogen or in ⫺80°C freezers until they are
delivered to NHRC.
Portions of the collected samples are tested at NHRC for broad viral and
bacterial detection and characterization using accredited diagnostic assays and
gold standard characterization methods. In the case of influenza virus, this
includes initial identification by in-house validated and College of American
Pathologists (CAP)-accredited diagnostic PCR tests designed to universally de-
tect all strains of influenza virus, human and otherwise, using highly conserved
priming sites (and, in the case of generic influenza A virus detection, two
independent tests). Research-use molecular and diagnostic hemagglutination
inhibition (HAI) assays are then used to discriminate between seasonal H1 and
H3 subtypes. Positive results are followed by sequence analysis of the hemag-
glutinin (H), neuraminidase (N), and matrix (M) segments, which contain the
primary antigenic and virulence determinants. The resulting isolates and data are
shared as part of CDC influenza surveillance activities.
Samples testing positive for influenza A virus but yielding negative results by
subtype-specific tests (“untypeable influenza A”) are further split, and aliquots
are forwarded to the CDC for analysis. These untypeable specimens are also
further analyzed by culture and sequencing at NHRC, after undergoing a series
of molecular assays chosen to prevent accidental culture of dangerous avian
influenza strains. This screening involves using the T5000.
Standard influenza A detection assays. Total nucleic acids were extracted
from 200 ␮l of a clinical specimen using the QIAamp 96 DNA blood kit
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In-
house CAP-accredited diagnostic PCR assays for influenza virus were as
previously described (7) except that primer set 2.5 was replaced with primer
set 3 (Flu_A_317-337_N/D_F1_2006: GACCRATYCTGTCACCTCTGAC
and Flu_A_94-118_N/D_R1_2006: CATYCAACTGGCAAGTGCAC). All
other conditions remained the same.
CAP-accredited culture-based methods were as described previously (10),
using both A549 and rhesus monkey kidney cell lines (Diagnostic Hybrids,
Athens, OH). Detection was by indirect fluorescent staining for influenza virus
using a mouse anti-influenza monoclonal antibody and fluorescein isothiocya-
nate (FITC) (catalog no. 5001 and 5008, respectively; Millipore, Billerica, MA).
HAI assays were performed using the WHO influenza reagent kit for the
identification of influenza isolates, supplied by the CDC (Atlanta, GA), following
the provided instructions. Guinea pig red blood cells for HAI testing were
purchased from Hardy Diagnostics (Santa Maria, CA). LightCycler real-time
PCR system assays for subtyping influenza were performed on the Roche Light-
Cycler 1.5 (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Primers (“F” and “R” sequences) and
probes (“P” sequences) used for subtyping influenza were as follows: for seasonal
H1 virus, FLU_A_H1_F: GYAGTCTTCCTTTCCAGAATGT, FLU_A_H1_R:
AGTCCTGTAACCATCCTTAATTTTG, and FLU_A_H1_P: (FAM)TAGGA
GAGTGTCCAAAGTATGTCAGGA(TAMRA); for seasonal H3 virus,
FLU_A_H3_F: TGTCTCCAGCAGAATAAGCATCT, FLU_A_H3_R: CCCA
CTTCGTATTTTGAAGTAACC, and FLU_A_H3_P: (FAM)TGGACAATAG
TAAAACCGGGAGACATACTTTTG(TAMRA). PCRs were performed using
the SuperScript III kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) per the manufacturer’s in-
structions, using 500-nm primers and a 300-nm probe. Following 30 min of
incubation at 45°C for reverse transcription and 2 min at 94°C denaturation and
35 to 45 cycles of 94°C for 5 s, followed by 60°C for 20 s, results were analyzed
by measuring fluorescent emission over the course of the amplification, per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
T5000 CAP validation procedure. From February 2007 to March 2007, throat
swabs were collected at various military training sites and border collection sites
as part of NHRC’s ongoing FRI surveillance programs. Throat swabs and/or
combined nasal/throat swabs were shipped frozen from collection sites to NHRC
in VTM (Remel, Lenexa, KS). Concurrent to NHRC’s routine FRI testing,
samples and controls were extracted in duplicate for validating the T5000. The
first extraction was done as part of our routine FRI testing and followed by PCR
analysis for the presence of influenza A. Samples were blinded for a second
extraction to be used for the T5000 validation. Samples were tested by all
methods in parallel, with different technicians (and in the case of culture, a
different lab in the same department) doing the independent analyses.
PCR/ESI-MS (T5000). The T5000 platform uses conserved-site PCR to inde-
pendently amplify six regions from five different segments of the influenza A
genome using sequence conservation, permissive PCR conditions, and target
multiplicity (3, 4, 9, 17, 18) to ensure that multiple amplicons will be obtained
from any known or, in theory, any previously unknown influenza virus. The
amplicons are then subjected to ESI-MS, generating a highly specific mass
measurement for each amplified PCR product. This mass is then deconvoluted
by software to generate a base composition signature (numbers of A’s, C’s, T’s,
and G’s) for the product. The resulting signatures obtained from multiple loci are
then compared with known signatures in a database (which includes both signa-
tures obtained directly from control specimens and signatures calculated from
published sequence data) to generate an internally verified identification, a
process called triangulation (17, 4). The process is automated, and a single
platform can analyze more than 180 samples in a 24-hour period.
In cases where exact or near-exact matches occur for multiple loci to the same
reference strain in the database, identity can be confidently established (17). In
cases where a novel agent is detected, the software will yield closest-match data
for the combined (triangulated) result, resulting in a phylogenetic identification
similar to that obtained for bacteria by multilocus sequence typing. The software
will also offer best-match data for each of the component amplicons, yielding
phylogenetic data similar to that obtained by comparative analysis of single
sequences. For influenza virus, this allows recognition of reassortment events

affecting the five assayed segments. It also enables inference of H and N types in
the case of previously characterized strains for which the sequences are known
for the five targeted segments (17).
Automated PCR setup was performed by the Janus liquid handling station
(PerkinElmer, Inc., Waltham, MA). Five microliters of nucleic acid extract (from
NHRC’s standard influenza detection protocols, as described above), 2 U
SuperScript III (Invitrogen), 2.42 U FastStart Taq DNA Polymerase (Roche
Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN), 333 ng T4 gene 32 protein (Roche), and 4.44 ␮l
kit-supplied enzyme dilution buffer (Ibis) were added to each well of a 96-well
T5000 influenza assay plate (Ibis). Primer sequences and other PCR components
were as previously described (17). The PCRs were amplified using a DNA engine
(Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) under cycling conditions previously de-
scribed (17). Following PCR, the T5000 influenza assay plate (Ibis) was loaded
onto the T5000 universal biosensor for automated post-PCR cleanup and sub-
sequent ESI-MS. The PCR product desalting procedure, ESI-MS, and spectral
view analysis of PCR product masses have been thoroughly described elsewhere
(9, 2, 11, 16).
RESULTS
T5000 CAP validation. A total of 331 samples were tested
during the 2006–2007 influenza season (excluding controls and
those that did not pass initial or in-process quality assurance/
quality control screening). The primary data and calculated
sensitivities, specificities, positive predictive values, and nega-
tive predictive values of the T5000 detection and characteriza-
tion functions are shown in Table 1. These samples are de-
scribed as “flu season samples” in Table 1, and they included
13 prepandemic seasonal H1N1-positive samples, 45 seasonal
H3N2-positive samples, and 11 influenza B-positive samples as
detailed in the table. For universal influenza virus detection,
the gold standard was composed of two CAP-accredited PCR
assays (see Table 1 footnotes for discussion). For influenza A
subtyping, the gold standards were an in-house validated real-
time PCR assay and a CAP-accredited culture and HAI assay.
For influenza B detection, the gold standard used was a CAP-
accredited influenza B viral culture and HAI assay.
Initial specificities (and hence positive predictive values)
were low for some possible results. However, it was hypothe-
sized that most of the apparent false positives might actually
represent low-titer true positives missed by the gold standard
PCR tests but detected by the more sensitive T5000. To assess
the false-positive rate of the T5000 more accurately, 273 sam-
ples from NHRC’s routine FRI surveillance collected during a
time period when no influenza A virus was present (the off-
season) were retrospectively tested on the T5000. These results
supported the hypothesis that the T5000 was more sensitive
than the gold standard PCR test and suggested that the true
specificity was approximately 99.3% (Table 1). The two false-
positive samples from this set were adjacent to spiked control
wells, suggesting that the remaining false positives were due to
technician error (cross-contamination).
Initial identification of 2009/H1N1 by PCR/ESI-MS. Initial
T5000 results confirmed that the sample collected in Imperial
County on 28 March was positive for influenza A virus. The
specimen generated reported amplicons for all six primer pairs
targeting influenza A virus. These included a universal influ-
enza primer pair targeting the polymerase basic protein 1 seg-
ment (PB1) and five influenza A-specific primer pairs: one
each targeting the M, NP, and PA segments and two primer
pairs targeting the segment that includes the nonstructural
proteins 1 and 2 (NS1 and NS2). All amplicons matched closely
the known influenza A virus signatures (Table 2), and all six
amplifying primer pairs generated a single amplicon (Fig. 1
and Table 2). Triangulation (9) of multiple matches to known
influenza virus signatures in the T5000 database yielded mul-
tiple matches to different subsets of the amplicons, suggesting
that different segments were more closely related to different
previously characterized strains (Table 2). Due to a lack of
identically matched signatures in the database and no triangu-
lated set of signatures with which this signature clustered, one
amplicon (NP) was not initially identified. Upon addition of
the new signature to the database, this segment was identified
as being closely related to recent H1N1 swine influenza iso-
lates. Several matches were imperfect, suggesting divergence
as well as reassortment.
Table 3 shows that positive matches were made to strains
other than those recognized as currently circulating human
influenzas, thus suggesting the novel nature of the influenza
strain. Furthermore, the results support a zoonotic (specifi-
cally, swine) origin of the virus, and the mixed nature of the
matches suggests a novel reassortant not previously reported
from human, swine, avian, or other sources. The assay correctly
inferred H type but not N type because the test does not

These samples were collected during a season with no detectable circulating influenza virus and were expected to be universally true negatives. These results suggest
that the majority (though not all) of apparent false positives returned during the influenza season are likely derived from correct detection of low-titer positives, which
were undetectable by the gold standard method.

The sensitivity could not be calculated for this test set because no true positives were included in this set.

The corrected positive predictive value (PPV) for this test set was determined under the assumption that the actual false-positive rate was the same for flu season
samples and off-season samples. With this assumption, the number of true positives during the flu season was 64, and the number of false positives was 2. Similar
corrections apply to the type- and subtype-specific tests.

directly assay H and N segments, which are too diverse to
support universal amplification using conserved-site priming.
Inference of H and N by triangulation (9) is possible only for
recognized strains that have not undergone reassortment. Ta-
ble 4 shows the specific GenBank sequence records to which
each amplicon match was made and describes the region of
each record homologous to the region amplified by the T5000
primer pairs.
We first addressed the possibility that the unique base com-
position signature produced by the 28 March sample was due
to the detection of a trivalent, live attenuated vaccine, FluMist
(MedImmune, Gaithersburg, MD), which, like other coinfec-
tions of multiple strains, can generate difficult-to-interpret re-
sults on influenza PCR and culture assays (7). A FluMist-
positive clinical specimen and extracted FluMist vaccine were
tested on the T5000 platform, and the signatures were com-
pared with those of the 28 March sample.
The FluMist vaccine generated amplicons for all eight
primer pairs of the T5000 influenza assay (Fig. 1 and Table 2).
Two amplicons with different base composition signatures
were produced for the universal influenza primer pair PB1 as
expected. Of the two amplicons produced by PB1 primers, one
amplicon matched known signatures for influenza A virus and
one matched signatures for influenza B virus. The influenza
A-specific primers M, NP, PA, NS1, and NS2 all generated one
amplicon each. The influenza B-specific primers targeting the
polymerase basic protein 2 segment (PB2) and NP both gen-
erated amplicons specific to influenza B. The three influenza B
amplicons triangulated to B/Ann Arbor/1/66, while the six
influenza A amplicons triangulated to A/Ann Arbor/6/60
(H2N2) (Table 3). This was expected, since these two influenza
strains were used as the backbones of the temperature-atten-
uated FluMist vaccine strains (7, 12).
When more than one influenza strain is present in a sample,
more than one amplicon may be generated per primer pair if
the strains differ at that locus. Multiple unique PCR products
were generated from FluMist for primer pair 2798 (universal
influenza targeting the PB1 segment), while only one was gen-
erated for the 28 March sample (Fig. 1). The first amplicon
generated by this primer pair is represented in blue (influenza
A), while the second amplicon is represented in green (influ-
enza B). Again, multiple products may be seen by deconvolu-
tion of masses as represented by base composition signatures
(Table 2).
Analysis of FluMist-positive samples using the T5000 plat-
form clearly demonstrates that the method can distinguish
coinfections of multiple strains by correctly deconvoluting and
triangulating the identities of multiple segments to generate
two clearly different identifications. In the case of the single
primer designed to amplify products from both influenza A
and influenza B (targeting the PB1 segment), amplicons from
both components are generated and identified. Moreover, the
ultimate identifications are made accurately, showing that two
strains are present and most closely matched the sequences of
the FluMist parent strains.
Affirming the assumption that the 28 March sample con-
tained a novel strain, the software analysis program failed to
definitively identify a specific influenza A strain or subtype
that closely matched at all loci, as it would for a well-
characterized strain for which there is a well-matched com-
plete genome sequence in public databases or for which an
annotated signature had previously been generated on the
T5000. Instead, the triangulation software identified differ-
ent best-matched strains for different sets of the amplified
loci. Only one amplicon was seen for each locus, suggesting
a single strain as opposed to a coinfection. This suggested a
reassorted virus for which different segments ultimately
arose from different sources.
Amplicons generated for the PA segment and the two NS
targets of the 2009/H1N1 strain matched equally closely strains
of both H1N2 influenza A virus of swine origin and H3N2
influenza A virus of avian origin. The expected matches for
each of these two influenza A type strains are identical in the
software’s database. The base composition for the PA ampli-
con matched the expected base compositions for swine H1N2
and avian H3N2 strains, with match values of ⫺1/⫹1/⫹1/⫺1
(this translates to approximately two single nucleotide poly-
morphisms [SNPs] between the amplicon and the closest
match). The base compositions generated by the two NS
primer pairs matched the expected base compositions for
swine H1N2 and avian H3N2 strains perfectly (match values,
0/0/0/0) (Table 2). The base composition generated by the NP

⫺1/⫹1/⫺1/⫹1.
Amplicons generated by the universal influenza virus PB1
and influenza A virus M primer pairs best matched expected
signatures from an avian H7N1 influenza A strain. The ampli-
con generated by the PB1 primer pair matched perfectly, while
the M detection differed from the expected signature by
⫺2/⫹2/⫹2/⫺2 (approximately four SNPs). All detections
clearly pointed to a single influenza A strain distinct from
recognized circulating strains and consistent with a zoonotic
origin.
Following the initial detection of the 2009/H1N1 strain,
the resulting signature was assigned a name on the basis of
the original sample number. This signature was retained
in the T5000 database for matching to further samples. This
allowed immediate screening of other samples for identical
(or similar) influenza viruses.
DISCUSSION
The T5000 PCR/ESI-MS platform can detect, characterize,
and confidently discriminate between common circulating in-
fluenza viruses, novel emerging influenza viruses, and even
mixed infections of currently rare (and artificially reassorted)
influenza viruses. The platform is automated and has high
throughput, capable of processing 180 samples per 24-hour

Individually colored peaks (series of vertical bars) represent multiple charge states of a single amplicon (allele). All peaks are normalized to their
maxima. Red peaks represent internal positive controls (IPCs), blue peaks represent primary amplicons, and green peaks represent secondary
detected amplicons of a different mass. Red peaks do not always show in tandem with positive amplifications, since the IPC signal may be obscured
by the higher titer of the target amplification.

time PCR and culture) and far superior to those of rapid
antigen assays (5), the most common method currently used
for point-of-care influenza diagnostics.
The T5000 generates amplicon mass data, not sequence
data. While these data can be used to accurately identify well-
characterized strains for which there are existing sequence
records in GenBank, it can offer only approximate phyloge-
netic similarities for individual segments of novel, unse-
quenced strains. In the case of the novel 2009 H1N1 pandemic
influenza virus, precise phylogenetic identity of the emerging
virus was ultimately achieved by traditional sequence analysis
at reference lab facilities (8).
Integration of broadly targeted and phylogenetically infor-
mative assays into hospital diagnostic systems would allow very
rapid recognition of novel pathogen emergence events, greatly
shortening the time between emergence and public health re-
sponse. One recent modeling effort suggested that the delay
between identification of an index case of a highly pathogenic
emergent avian influenza virus and responses such as targeted
antiviral prophylaxis of contacts is critical to the success of such
countermeasures. The window for success of such strategies
may be as little as 2 days (14). It can be assumed that this also
applies to delays between occurrence and recognition of the
index case. Another pandemic preparedness model suggested
that the effectiveness of pandemic influenza containment pol-
icies such as social distancing and mass prophylaxis with anti-
virals also “depends critically on how quickly clinical cases are
diagnosed” (6).
The same study (6) notes that the first two predicates for
successful containment are “[1] rapid identification of the orig-
inal case cluster, [2] rapid, sensitive case detection and delivery
of treatment to targeted groups, preferably within 48 h of a
case arising.” This might be possible for the strain of H5 avian
flu virus currently circulating in Southeast Asia, for which
specific rapid diagnostics have been and are being developed,
but would not currently be possible for the nearly infinite
number of other possible influenza strains that might be trans-
ferred to humans. As pandemics progress, the area requiring

swine influenza isolates.

containment increases exponentially, the affected population
requiring intervention increases exponentially, and the associ-
ated costs follow a similar path. Discussions of the costs and
benefits of pandemic preparedness tend to focus on counter-
measures such as prevaccination and antiviral stockpiling (15),
despite the fact that those strategies are entirely dependent on
very rapid detection and identification. The course of the 2009
influenza pandemic and the history of its initial characteriza-
tion demonstrate that we do not currently have this capability.
The fact that the 2009 H1N1 pandemic strain came essen-
tially “out of nowhere,” rather than from well-recognized pre-
dicted sources (as was the case with avian H5 influenza virus
from Southeast Asia [14]), suggests that attempting to generate
specific diagnostics for strains that we predict will become the
next pandemic agents is likely futile. We need universal influ-
enza virus diagnostics that can detect and characterize all
known strains of influenza and also detect and characterize
previously unrecognized strains. In the course of the emer-
gence of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus, the T5000
demonstrated that capability in a very compelling real-world
situation.
