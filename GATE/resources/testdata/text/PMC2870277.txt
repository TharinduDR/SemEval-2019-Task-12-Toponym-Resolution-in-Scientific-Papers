SUMMARY
During the period 2000–2003, wild grey foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) in northern Colombia
became infected with rabies. In order to derive phylogenetic relationships between rabies viruses
isolated in foxes, dogs and humans in this region, 902 nt cDNA fragments containing the G–L
intergenic region and encoding the cytoplasmic domain of protein G and a fragment of protein L
were obtained by RT–PCR, sequenced and compared. Phylogenetic analysis showed that rabies
viruses isolated in foxes, dogs and humans belonged to a single genetic variant. Speculative
analysis together with epidemiological data indicated that rabies in foxes may have been due to
contact with rabid dogs. Rabies transmission between dogs, wild foxes and humans may happen
in natural conditions in northern Colombia. This ﬁnding is the ﬁrst to suggest dog-to-fox rabies
transmission in South America, and provides another example of dog rabies variants being able
to successfully colonize wildlife hosts.
INTRODUCTION
Rabies is caused by highly neurotropic viruses of the
genus Lyssavirus family Rhabdoviridae [1]. Rabies
virus reservoirs belong to mainly Carnivora and
Chiroptera species that may transmit the disease to
cul-de-sac mammals including humans. Urban and
sylvatic rabies is an important public health and
economic problem in most Latin-American countries.
In Colombia, rabies has historically occurred in two
major epidemiological forms: urban rabies with the
domestic dog as the main reservoir and transmitter of
the disease to humans, and sylvatic rabies with bats
as the main reservoirs and transmitters of the disease
mainly to cows and horses [2, 3]. Since the early 1990s,
urban rabies has been endemic in dogs in northern
Colombia. All urban rabies viruses in that region
belong to a single genetic variant (Colombian gen-
etic variant II), with no other genetic variant being
transmitted [4]. Lately, during the period 2000–2003,
20 grey foxes of the species Urocyon cinereoargenteus
Schreber, 1775 [5] (Fig. 1) in northern Colombia have
been diagnosed with rabies, and these may provide
a threat to public health in this region, due to the
frequent contact with farmers and animals such as
dogs, cats and cattle. There is currently no control
strategy for rabies in Colombian foxes. The number
of rabid foxes living in the region is unknown.
The aim of this study was to derive phylogenetic
relationships between rabies viruses isolated in foxes
and dogs in northern Colombia. These aspects of the
epidemiology are important for understanding the
dynamics of rabies between urban and wild ecosys-
tems and are crucial in designing strategies for the
control of the disease. The study is the continuation of
a previous one which focused on the epidemiology

of rabies in dogs and humans in three rabies endemic
areas in Colombia [4]. The major contribution of this
paper apart from analysing a larger set of rabies iso-
lates, is the identiﬁcation of Urocyon cinereoargenteus
as having a potentially important role in the complex
epidemiology of rabies in the only region in Colombia
in which rabies is endemic.
METHODS
Viruses
This study included 85 rabies isolates, 45 of which had
been previously analysed [4]: 59 were from dogs, 20
from grey foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) and six
from humans, collected between August 1994 and
April 2003 in northern Colombia. Rabies diagnosis
was by virus isolation in Institute of Cancer Research
(ICR) mice [6] and immunoﬂuorescence assays using
speciﬁc antibodies. Rabies isolates were stored at
x80 xC in the form of frozen mouse brain material.
Antigenic analysis
Antigenic characterization was performed by indirect
immunoﬂuorescence of acetone-ﬁxed impressions of
rabies-infected brain material as described previously
[7], using a panel of eight monoclonal antibodies
produced against the rabies nucleoprotein at the
Centers for Disease Control (CDC, Atlanta, GA,
USA).
RNA extraction and PCR
RNA was extracted as previously described [8].
Brieﬂy, 100 mg frozen mouse brain-passaged ma-
terial was dissolved in 0.75 ml Trizol (Gibco-BRL;
Gaithersburg, MD, USA) and extracted once with
0.25 ml chloroform. Total RNA was precipitated
with one volume of 100% iso-propyl alcohol, washed
with 70% ethanol and made up to 50 ml with 1%
diethyl-pyrocarbonate (DEPC) in double-distilled
water. An oligonucleotide primer pair (designed G–L)
[9, 10] was used to amplify a 902-nt fragment that
contains the region coding for the cytoplasmic do-
main of the glycoprotein (amino acids 447–525 of the
native glycoprotein), and for amino acids 1–35 of
protein L. The PCR fragment also contains the
pseudogene Psi [11]. The positive strand primer G of
sequence 5k-GACTTGGGTCTCCCAACTGGGG-3k
primes the polymerase reaction at position 4665–4687
of the rabies genome. The negative strand primer L

numbering of the published Pasteur virus (PV)
sequence [9, 12–14]. Total brain RNA was hybridized
with the G primer (150 ng) at 65 xC for 2 min and
reverse transcribed at 42 xC for 90 min in a total vol-
ume of 10 ml [9]. Ampliﬁcation using the G–L primer
set was carried out using 2 ml of the cDNA reaction
mixture in a total volume of 50 ml employing a
Thermal Cycler (PerkinElmer; Foster City, CA,
USA) and using conditions similar to those described
previously [14].
DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis
Direct sequencing of gel-puriﬁed PCR products was
performed using the G–L primer set in an automatic
sequencing apparatus (ABI Prism 310, Applied
Biosystems; Foster City, CA, USA). DNA sequence
analysis and the construction of phylogenetic trees
were performed using the ClustalX package [15], the
PHYLIP 3.52 package [16], and the TREEVIEW program
(University of Glasgow, UK). For construction of
phylogenetic trees the neighbour-joining method [17]
was used combined with 500 bootstrap resampling,
a statistical method that calculates conﬁdence limits
with respect to the phylogenetic tree [18].
RESULTS
The geographical origin of the 85 rabies virus strains
is shown in Figure 2 and epidemiological information
is given in Table 1. Diﬀerential reaction with mono-
clonal antibodies identiﬁed two antigenic variants of
rabies viruses in the study sample (Tables 1 and 2).
Antigenic variant 1 which is associated with rabies
in Latin American dogs was found in all samples
of viruses isolated from grey foxes, in all samples of
viruses isolated from dogs with only one exception
(isolate C27/97) and in all viruses isolated from
humans with only one exception (H03/97) (Tables 1
and 2). Antigenic variant 4 which is associated with

frugivorous and insectivorous bats was found in two
samples C27/97 isolated from a dog and one virus
(H03/97) isolated from a human being (Tables 1
and 2).
Figure 3 shows the outcome of phylogentic analysis
of the aligned G and Psi-L nucleotide sequences,
which also showed the isolates to fall into two separ-
ate groups. The ﬁrst group consisted of 83 strains
(ﬁve isolated from humans in August 1994–February
1999, 20 from grey foxes in June 2000–December
2002, and 58 from dogs in July 1995–April 2003).
The average nucleotide similarity among viruses of
this group was 98.5%, which indicates that these
are closely related. Prototype sequences for this
ﬁrst group of rabies strains are identical to those
for rabies strains that belong to Colombian genetic
variant II [4], indicating that those reported here
can be included into that variant too. The second
group of rabies viruses consisted of two strains (H03/
97 and C27/97) isolated in 1997 from a human and
a dog respectively. According to a previously pub-
lished study [4] H03/97 and C27/97 are bat rabies
variants.
DISCUSSION
During the 1990s urban rabies transmitted among
dogs spread over approximately 40 000 km2
in
northern Colombia [4]. In the period January 1992
to December 2003, 725 total cases of urban rabies

been highly eﬀective in the last 6 years, having
reduced the number of cases in dogs from 188 in 1998
to 12 in 2003, and in humans from 6 to 0. During
the period 2000–2003, 20 wild grey foxes in northern
Colombia infected with rabies were diagnosed in the
Colombian National Reference Laboratory for urban
rabies at Instituto Nacional de Salud, in Bogotá.
The real number of rabid foxes living in this region,
however, remains unknown. Phylogenetic analysis
showed that rabies viruses isolated in foxes, dogs
and humans belong to a single genetic variant
previously named ‘Colombian genetic variant II’ [4].
No subvariants were deﬁned in the above variant,
and no clear tendencies of variant subgrouping by
geographical region, nor any obvious increase in
rabid fox numbers as a result of adaptation of rabies
into the fox population were seen in the study area. In
previous studies, computational methods have been
used to estimate nucleotide substitution rates in urban
rabies viruses isolated in Colombia [19]. Results of
those studies indicated that the Colombian genetic
variant II viruses have been circulating in Colombia
since the 1960s. Evidence of some degree of positive
selection (an indicator of evolution) was found in
Colombian genetic variant II viruses, however, the
limitations of the data, including short nucleotide
sequences, small number of taxa and small sampling
period, were responsible for the low statistical sig-
niﬁcance of the results in those studies.
The data presented here taken together with epi-
demiological surveillance with no reports of rabid
foxes before 2000, suggests that rabies in grey foxes
may be due to contact with rabid dogs. Our data
are validated by continuous surveillance programmes
performed in the study region in the 1990s and 2000s,
with no periods of improved surveillance that could
explain sudden changes in the frequency of rabid
foxes reported. Although no transmission of rabies
has been conﬁrmed from grey foxes to humans or
dogs, this may easily happen in natural conditions in
northern Colombia due to frequent contact of foxes
with farmers and animals such as dogs, cats and
cattle. Foxes may, therefore, pose a threat for public
health in that region. Urban rabies virus in Colombia
seems to have found a new host, and one which is
not vulnerable to the current rabies control strategies
in dogs used by the Ministry of Health in Colombia.
Novel rabies control strategies need to be evaluated
for use in Colombia, not only for wild rabid grey
foxes but other wild carnivore species which may
become a threat to public health.
Due to their geographical distribution [5, 20]
(Fig. 1), Colombian grey foxes could eventually
spread urban rabies into both urban and wild eco-
systems in Venezuela and Central America. The grey
fox has been identiﬁed as a reservoir of urban and
sylvatic rabies in the United States. Since the early
1980s antigenic variants 1 and 7 rabies viruses cir-
culate in grey foxes in geographically limited areas
of Texas and Arizona respectively [21, 22]. There is
no genetic relationship between the rabies viruses
isolated from grey foxes in Colombia and Arizona: in
fact these two groups of viruses belong to two distinct
antigenic variants.
The data presented here are the ﬁrst that report
grey foxes as reservoirs of urban rabies in South
America, pointing to this species as a direct threat to
human health and showing the spread of urban rabies
to the wild. Previous studies have also shown that
wildlife hosts can be successfully colonized by dog
rabies variants. Perhaps the most widely known
examples are the cases in Europe where rabies prob-
ably jumped from domestic dogs to foxes and to rac-
coon dogs [23], and the United States where evidence
indicates that a dog rabies variant jumped to skunks
in the northeastern region of the country [24]. Other
spillover events of rabies from dogs to wildlife
species have been observed in Southern Africa [25,
26], Turkey [27] and Puerto Rico [28] among others.
On the other hand, wildlife rabies variants can also
be transmitted to unvaccinated dogs, thus entering
urban environments, as has been observed in the
former Yugoslavia [29].
