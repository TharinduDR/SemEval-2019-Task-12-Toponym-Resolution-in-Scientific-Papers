Physical capability in later life is influenced by factors occurring across the life course, yet exposures to area
conditions have only been examined cross-sectionally. Data from the National Survey of Health and Development,
a longitudinal study of a 1946 British birth cohort, were used to estimate associations of area deprivation (defined
as percentage of employed people working in partly skilled or unskilled occupations) at ages 4, 26, and 53 years
(residential addresses linked to census data in 1950, 1972, and 1999) with 3 measures of physical capability at
age 53 years: grip strength, standing balance, and chair-rise time. Cross-classified multilevel models with individuals nested within areas at the 3 ages showed that models assessing a single time point underestimate total area
contributions to physical capability. For balance and chair-rise performance, associations with area deprivation in
midlife were robust to adjustment for individual socioeconomic position and prior area deprivation (mean change
for a 1-standard-deviation increase: balance, −7.4% (95% confidence interval (CI): −12.8, −2.8); chair rise, 2.1%
(95% CI: −0.1, 4.3)). In addition, area deprivation in childhood was related to balance after adjustment for childhood socioeconomic position (−5.1%, 95% CI: −8.7, −1.6). Interventions aimed at reducing midlife disparities in
physical capability should target the socioeconomic environment of individuals—for standing balance, as early as
childhood.

It has consistently been shown that major disability
affects older people’s ability to live independently (1). The
treatment and management of disability is expensive (2); for
example, the United Kingdom Treasury has estimated that
approximately £33.3 billion (approximately $54.4 billion)
was spent on sickness and disability pensions in 2012 (3).
Thus, identifying factors that could delay or prevent the
onset of disability could have a large impact on the social and
economic costs of caring for an aging population.
There is growing evidence that people who live in more
deprived areas in later life also have worse physical health,
when measured by self-reported functional limitations (4),

mobility disability (5), and general disability (6, 7). Objective
measures of physical capability, such as grip strength, chairrise performance, and balance (8), have been shown to be
predictors of disability (9) but have not been considered in
relation to area characteristics. Physical capability in midlife
has been shown to be a consequence of factors that exert an
inﬂuence across the life course, such as growth in childhood
and adult body size (10, 11). Hence, the socioeconomic environment in which people live earlier in life may be associated with physical capability in later life. In addition, the
residential mobility of individuals and socioeconomic changes in areas over time means that analyses based on place of
441

residence at a single time point could produce mis-estimation of the effect of area. Establishing the portion of the life
course in which residence area makes the most difference to
physical capability could also help focus interventions on
those area characteristics that affect speciﬁc age groups.
Therefore, in this study, we linked prospectively collected
residential addresses of participants in the Medical Research
Council’s National Survey of Health and Development at
ages 4, 26, and 53 years to census area socioeconomic data to
investigate when during the life course area deprivation was
associated with objective measures of physical capability in
midlife. We further examined whether these relationships were
independent of individual life-course socioeconomic position
(SEP).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study population

The National Survey of Health and Development is an
ongoing study of a socioeconomically stratiﬁed sample of
5,362 singleton births that took place in England, Scotland,
and Wales during 1 week in March 1946. Cohort members
have been followed up 22 times from birth to age 53 years,
and a wealth of data has been collected throughout their
lives on their social circumstances and health. At age 53
years, the sample providing information consisted of 3,035
men and women, representing 70.4% of the 4,311 cohort
members who were still alive and residing in England, Scotland, or Wales (12).
Physical capability

In 1999, when the study participants were aged 53 years,
trained nurses visited their homes to measure performance
on the chair-rise test (number of seconds needed to rise from
a sitting position to a standing position and then sit down
again 10 times), standing balance (the longest amount of time
the person can maintain a 1-legged stand with eyes closed—
maximum of 30 seconds), and grip strength (highest value
(kg) from 4 measurements, 2 from each hand, taken using an
electronic handgrip dynamometer). A total of 2,566 participants (84.5%) provided data on all 3 physical capability measures. The remaining 469 participants had missing data and
were excluded from the analyses; 73 were missing data on
all 3 tests, 182 were missing data on 1 or 2 tests, and 214 were
unable to perform 1 test (133 for chair rise, 42 for standing
balance, and 39 for grip strength).
Life-course area deprivation

At every data collection, current place of residence was
recorded on survey forms for each study member. Place of
residence at 3 different ages was chosen to represent area
in childhood (age 4 years—1950), early adulthood (age 26
years—1972), and midlife (age 53 years—1999) and to be
close to census years. The overall process of linking residential addresses to area deprivation measures was a 2-step one
(13). First, automated matching was carried out on addresses
in order to allocate to each place of residence a grid coor-

dinate. Second, these generated coordinates were used to
link area data from the closest census: 1951 data for local
government districts for 1950 (14, 15), 1971 data for districts for 1972 (16, 17), and 2001 data for districts or unitary
authorities for 1999 (18, 19). For 1951 and 1971, Scottish
addresses had to be linked to data for counties and the 4
main cities, since district data were not available (15, 17).
All 2,566 cohort members who completed all 3 physical
capability tests had an address collected at age 53 years
(1999). The United Kingdom’s Ofﬁce of National Statistics
All Fields Postal Directory (20) was used to implement both
linkage steps, and 2,554 postcodes (99.5%) were assigned to
2001 local government districts. For the other years, Imperial College London’s Small Area Health Statistics Unit
(SAHSU) used the Ordnance Survey’s ADDRESS-POINT
database (21) to generate grid coordinates for 2,390 postcodes
from 1972 (9.8%) and 1,347 addresses from 1950 (55.0%),
since 1950 predated the introduction of postcodes. The generated coordinates were then linked by the University of
Portsmouth’s Great Britain Historical Geographic Information System (GIS) Project to the relevant historical area boundary using county administrative diagrams (22, 23). For the
40 postcodes from 1972 (1.6%) and the 1,101 addresses from
1950 (45.0%) that could not be matched by the SAHSU team,
the Great Britain Historical GIS team employed manual
methods of assignment (13).
Overall, when an address or postcode was available, more
than 99.0% were linked to the appropriate census area from
1951, 1971, or 2001. A further 13 were excluded because area
deprivation data were missing for the area in which the participant resided for 1 of the study years. This resulted in a
sample size of 2,300 persons for analysis. The percentage of
employed persons in each area with occupations that were
partly skilled or unskilled was selected as the primary area
socioeconomic variable, since we have previously (13) shown
it to be the most consistent and appropriate available census
variable for approximating area deprivation across all study
years.
Individual SEP

Individual SEP information from the same data collections as the address information was used in these analyses.
Childhood SEP was based on father’s occupation when the
cohort member was aged 4 years (1950), while both young
adult SEP and adult SEP were based on the cohort member’s
own occupation at ages 26 and 53 years, respectively. Occupational class was assigned using the Registrar General’s 6group classiﬁcation (24). If SEP information was missing,
then SEP at the closest available age was taken (n = 36 at age
4 from age 7 years, n = 139 at age 26 from age 36 years, and
n = 78 at age 53 years from age 43 years).
Statistical analysis

For each study year, differences in mean area deprivation
by gender, country of residence, education, and individual
SEP were compared using analysis of variance (Table 1). Grip
strength was divided by height in centimeters to account for
body size (25) and then multiplied by 10 for presentation

purposes. Because of a skewed distribution, logarithmic transformation was applied to standing-balance and chair-rise data
to achieve normality.
First, all models were ﬁtted as 2-level models of individuals
nested within areas for each of the 3 study years, with each
year being analyzed separately without incorporation of information about residence area for the other 2 years (Figure 1A).
Then, cross-classiﬁed models were ﬁtted that extended the
initial 2-level models to include random level 2 components
for area, where individuals were nested within up to 3 different areas from 1950, 1972, and 1999 (Figure 1B). The percentage of the variance explained by area in each year was
then compared between the 2 models. In addition, the overall
percentage of variance explained by life-course area was calculated from the cross-classiﬁed models by summing area
variance for all 3 study years and dividing by the total variance.

Area-level variance was assessed before and after the inclusion of area deprivation and individual SEP measures. Statistical models and formulas are presented in the Appendix.
Using both types of models, we then examined the relationship between area deprivation for each time period
(1950, 1972, or 1999) and each physical capability outcome
at the age of 53 years. Initially, area deprivation was modeled
separately for each year. Results for the standing-balance and
chair-rise tests are presented as the mean percentage change
in seconds (26) for a 1-standard-deviation (SD) difference in
area deprivation, with its associated 95% conﬁdence interval.
For grip strength, estimates are shown as the mean difference
in kg/cm. Then, each model was ﬁtted to include individual
SEP from the same age (i.e., 1950 area deprivation adjusted
for childhood SEP). Third, models were ﬁtted to assess whether
area deprivation was independent of area deprivation at prior
time points (i.e., 1972 adjusted for 1950). Final models contained all prior area deprivation measures and current and
prior individual SEP (i.e., 1972 area deprivation adjusted for
area deprivation in 1950, young adult SEP, and childhood
SEP).
Finally, to determine whether earlier area deprivation modiﬁed the effects of subsequent area deprivation measures, interaction terms were added to the models (i.e., 1950 × 1972,
1972 × 1999, and 1950 × 1999). All analyses were performed
using SAS statistical software, version 9 (SAS Institute Inc.,
Cary, North Carolina). Since the average number of individuals
within areas was low, we repeated all analyses using Markov
chain Monte Carlo estimation in MLwiN (Centre for Multilevel
Modelling, University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom).
Results remained unchanged, and hence only those from the
original method using maximum likelihood analyses are
presented here.
RESULTS

In 1951 and 1971, cohort members lived in over half of
all local government districts in England and Wales and
almost all counties in Scotland. On average, there were 2.8
and 2.7 persons per area in 1951 and 1971, respectively.
Averages were higher in Scotland compared with England
and Wales and in 1999 compared with earlier years, because
of larger geographical areas. The average area deprivation
( percentage of persons employed in semiskilled or unskilled
occupations) of the areas in which cohort members lived
was highest in 1951, at 29.3% (SD, 7.6), and declined steadily to 25.0% (SD, 6.1) in 1971 and 19.8% (SD, 2.9) in 2001.
For cohort members, the strongest correlation in standardized area deprivation measures occurred between the years
1972 and 1999, at 0.49, while correlations were lower
between 1950 and both 1972 (0.30) and 1999 (0.33).
There were no gender differences in area deprivation for
any of the years. For all time periods, average area deprivation was higher for areas in Scotland and Wales compared
with England and for persons who had fathers who worked
in a manual occupation compared with a nonmanual occupation (Table 1). However, cohort members who changed their
individual SEP from childhood to young adulthood lived in
areas with lower deprivation in midlife than persons who
remained in a manual social class at both ages (mean area

deprivation for change from a manual occupation to a nonmanual occupation = 19.6%; mean area deprivation for a
manual occupation at both time points = 20.6%; P for difference < 0.002). The reverse pattern occurred for persons who
were downwardly socially mobile (data not shown).
For all 3 outcomes, when nested models were used, signiﬁcant variation existed across areas for all study periods,
with larger variation for balance than for chair rise and quite
small variation for grip strength (Table 2). For balance and
chair rise, the total amount of variation explained by area
was larger for 1972 and 1999 than for 1950. For example,
approximately 8.4% and 8.6% of the total variance for
balance was explained by area in 1972 and 1999, respectively,
with almost half the amount of variance (4.6%) explained
by area in 1950. Area in each of the 3 years accounted for
3%–4% of the variation in grip strength. For all outcomes,
use of cross-classiﬁed models reduced the percentage of variance attributable to area at each year. Summation of the area
variance from all 3 years to obtain the percentage of variance
explained by lifetime area gave ﬁgures of 12.9% for balance,
16.1% for chair rise, and 7.9% for grip strength. For all further
analyses, we display results ﬁtted with cross-classiﬁed models
only.
For standing balance, adjustment for area deprivation at all
3 ages reduced but did not entirely explain area variation (percentage reductions: 1950, 30.0%; 1972, 3.2%; 1999, 32.4%
(see Web Table 1, available at http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/)).
For ﬁxed effects (Figure 2), there were associations between
area deprivation at all 3 time points and standing balance at
age 53 years (1999). For example, cohort members who
Am J Epidemiol. 2013;178(3):441–450

resided in areas with a 1-SD higher area deprivation level in
1999 had, on average, 10.6% (95% conﬁdence interval (CI):
6.7, 14.4) lower balance times (worse physical capability)
(model 1). Associations were weaker for area deprivation in
1950 (6.3%, 95% CI: 2.9, 9.7) and 1972 (4.9%, 95% CI: 1.2,
8.5). Area deprivation in 1950 remained associated with
balance, albeit reduced, after adjustment for childhood SEP
(model 2). In fully adjusted models (model 4), whereas area
deprivation in 1999 was robust to adjustment for all prior area
deprivation and all prior and current individual SEP measures,
area deprivation in 1972 was largely explained. There were no
interactions between area deprivation in 1999 and area deprivation in either prior study year (for 1999 × 1950, P = 0.55;
for 1999 × 1972, P = 0.27). Associations of area deprivation
and physical capability measures obtained using nested models
are available in Web Table 2.
For the chair-rise test, in comparison with the unadjusted
models, area variances in 1972 and 1999 were only marginally reduced after adjustment for area deprivation at all 3 ages
(1.6% and 2.4%, respectively) (Web Table 1). However, patterns of association were similar; the strongest association
was in 1999, with an increased mean chair-rise time at age
53 years (worse physical capability) of 2.2% (95% CI: 0.3,
4.1) per 1-SD increase in area deprivation, which was only
slightly attenuated by adjustment for adult SEP (Figure 2,
model 2), prior area deprivation (model 3), and all prior individual SEP measures (model 4). In addition, only for the
year 1999 was any of the original area variance in chair rise
explained by area deprivation (2.8%) (data not shown). There
was no interaction between area deprivation in 1999 and

or unskilled occupations. Because of missing data, models adjusting for individual SEP (models 2 and 4) contained fewer than 2,300 participants.

area deprivation in 1972 (P = 0.90). The unadjusted mean differences in grip strength by area deprivation were so small as
to not be clinically relevant (for all years, < 0.006 kg/cm per
1-SD increase in area deprivation), and thus no further analyses are presented.
DISCUSSION

Findings from this study show that for members of this
postwar British cohort, those who resided in more deprived
areas at age 53 years also had worse standing-balance and
chair-rise times. Importantly, we showed that the variation in
these 2 physical capability measures at midlife that could be
attributed to area of residence was underestimated when residence at earlier points in the life course was not taken into
consideration. In particular, the ability of cohort members to
stand on 1 leg at midlife was related to both childhood and midlife exposure to area deprivation.

The ﬁnding that poorer standing-balance and chair-rise
times were associated with current deprivation is consistent
with previous cross-sectional studies showing that living in
a socioeconomically deprived area in adulthood is associated
with worse physical health (4, 5, 7, 27, 28). We have built
on these previous studies by showing, for the ﬁrst time, that
area deprivation in childhood is related to standing balance in
midlife. Further, comparisons of the cross-classiﬁed models
with the simpler 2-level hierarchical models showed that by
failing to account for area of residence in childhood, the
overall contribution of residence area to variation in balance
performance in midlife was underestimated.
To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to utilize geographical data linked to prospectively collected address information
during childhood, early adulthood, and midlife and link these
exposures to health disparities in midlife. The relationship

Life-Course Area Deprivation and Physical Capability 447

the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, a summary
measure of life-course area deprivation was not associated with
subclinical atherosclerosis after adjustment for life-course
individual SEP, although recall of childhood residence may
have resulted in bias and underestimation of effects (29).
The ONS Longitudinal Study for England and Wales (30)
used prospectively collected address data to show that longterm illness was a consequence of area deprivation during
both childhood (1939) and later life (1981). Finally, 2 Scandinavian studies (31–33) used cross-classiﬁed models to
show that area of residence at the most recent time point
(1999) explained more variance in mortality than residence
in earlier years (1969, 1979, and 1989). For the latter study
(33), the overall variance explained by area was much less
than that in our study. Discrepancies may be explained by a
particular effect of area on the physical disablement process
or country-speciﬁc geographical inequalities. Neither study
analyzed ﬁxed effects of areas.
The mechanism(s) by which area deprivation could be
affecting physical capability in midlife is unclear. Numerous
studies have shown that higher area deprivation is related to
poorer dietary habits (34–37), less physical activity (34, 38–
41), and higher rates of smoking (34, 39, 41–45), all of
which are risk factors for declines in functional status (46,
47). Inequitable geographical distribution of these factors,
such as availability of health food (48), could inﬂuence
growth, thereby permanently altering or establishing vulnerability in the functional capacity of an individual (10, 11). In
addition, area characteristics in childhood may inﬂuence the
development of health behaviors such as physical activity
(49, 50) and diet (51), which are related to physical capability and tend to track into adulthood. Future work is required
to examine speciﬁc features of the area socioeconomic environment during different life periods that could lead to poor
physical capability at all ages.
The ﬁnding that area deprivation in midlife was related to
standing balance and chair rise but not to grip strength may
suggest that these factors are inﬂuenced by different pathophysiology. All 3 measures depend on the central nervous
system for sensory and motor control, but while grip strength
is a test of upper-body strength, balance and chair-rise time
reﬂect differing combinations of mainly lower-body neuromuscular speed and control (52–54). Stronger ﬁndings of
area effects across the life course for balance than for chairrise performance may also suggest that area deprivation is
affecting adult physical capability through central nervous
system pathways rather than through muscle atrophy. This is
supported by previous ﬁndings from this cohort, where Kuh
et al. (52) observed that balance and chair-rise performance
were both linked to changes in adult cognition but only balance was independently related to childhood cognition. Such
pathways remain speculative, as there are no current studies
linking area deprivation to central nervous system outcomes
in childhood or midlife.
We found associations with area deprivation to be only
slightly explained by individual SEP. However, we have not
investigated the complex ways in which individual SEP and
area SEP interact over the life course. Family social position
in childhood can inﬂuence not only the future SEP of that
child (55, 56) but also potentially his or her future adulthood
Am J Epidemiol. 2013;178(3):441–450

residence, because of close links between individual SEP
and residential SEP (57). Thus, adjustment of current area
characteristics for prior individual and area deprivation may
represent overadjustment. The stronger association seen with
current area characteristics, as compared with childhood and
young adulthood, provides some support for the role of
adult environmental factors in maintaining and facilitating
greater physical activity and healthy diet. However, it may
also reﬂect a “selection effect” such that less healthy persons
with poorer physical performance move to more deprived
areas, thereby creating an association through reverse causation. Our data did show that downward social mobility was
related to higher deprivation at midlife, making it plausible
that some or all of the area effects may be due to selection
(58). More work is needed to disentangle the relationships
between individuals, their residence areas, and their health
over the life course to create appropriate methods and to test
whether observed associations are true effects of residential
area or artifacts of residential selection.
A strength of this study was the repeated prospective collection of area residential addresses and individual socioeconomic characteristics across the life course. The almost
100% linkage of address data for all 3 years made it less likely
that estimates were affected by selection bias. As in any longitudinal study, attrition of the sample occurred, despite high
response rates (12). However, area deprivation did not predict loss to follow-up. A total of 469 persons were excluded
because of the inability to perform a physical capability test
or were missing data for a physical capability test. While
there were no average differences in area deprivation for cohort
members missing test results, those unable to perform tests
(n = 214) resided in areas with higher levels of deprivation
(data not shown), suggesting that associations between area
deprivation and physical capability were underestimated by
virtue of the exclusion of persons with the lowest physical
capabilities from the analysis.
Major challenges in this study were that we were restricted
in the size of the geographical units we could analyze and the
area socioeconomic measures we could assess because of
the limitations of historical census data (13). It is unknown
whether local government district is the relevant area that
might inﬂuence physical capability. When analyses of area
deprivation at age 53 years and physical capability were rerun
at the ward level, the estimates of association were stronger
(13), suggesting that the relevant context may be at a smaller
geographical level and that our ﬁndings underestimate the
effect of area. District boundaries for 2001 were larger than
those in 1951 and 1971 (59), with approximately 3 times the
population (13), potentially introducing a larger degree of
underestimation for area effects in 2001 compared with earlier
years. Household-level factors may also be relevant to health
outcomes (60), but information at this level was not available in our data. Extensive social change over the past 50
years (61) also makes it unclear whether the percentage of
individuals in partly skilled or unskilled occupations in an
area represented the same concept of area deprivation during
all study periods. Future work is needed to investigate whether
the mechanism(s) linking area occupational classes to physical
capability are consistent across different periods of the life
course.

In conclusion, ﬁndings from this study suggest that strategies for the prevention of disability need to consider not only
individual characteristics but also the residential environments
in which people live. Some aspects of disability, such as
the ability to balance, may require interventions aimed at
improving the areas in which people grow up and in which
they reside in midlife in order to maximize impact. However,
before interventions can be planned, further work is needed to
identify the speciﬁc pathways and appropriate geographical
levels by which disparities in residential socioeconomic environment could affect midlife physical performance.
