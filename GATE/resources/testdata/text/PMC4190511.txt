The Andhra Pradesh Children and Parents Study (APCAPS) was
originally established to study the long-term effects of early-life
undernutrition on risk of cardiovascular disease. Its aims were subsequently expanded to include trans-generational influences of
other environmental and genetic factors on chronic diseases in
rural India. It builds on the Hyderabad Nutrition Trial (HNT) conducted in 1987–90 to compare the effects on birthweight of a protein-calorie supplement for pregnant women and children. The
index children of HNT and their mothers were retraced and examined in 2003–05, and the children re-examined as young adults
aged 18–21 years in 2009–10. The cohort was expanded to include
both parents and siblings of the index children in a recently completed follow-up conducted in 2010–12 (N ¼ 6225 out of 10 213
participants). Recruitment of the remaining residents of these 29
villages (N ¼ 55 000) in Ranga Reddy district of Andhra Pradesh is
now under way. Extensive data on socio-demographic, lifestyle,
medical, anthropometric, physiological, vascular and body composition measures, DNA, stored plasma, and assays of lipids and inflammatory markers on APCAPS participants are available. Details of how
to access these data are available from the corresponding author.

Why was the cohort set up?
The ‘developmental origins of adult disease hypothesis’ argues that undernutrition in early life plays a
critical role in determining an individual’s future risk
of cardiovascular disease.1–4 The evidence in support
of this hypothesis is largely observational but the

opportunity to follow up a controlled comparison of
a pregnancy and early childhood nutrition intervention in India—the Hyderabad Nutrition Trial (HNT)—
was initiated. A long-term follow-up of this trial was
conducted from 2003–05 to explore this hypothesis
among mothers and children born during the HNT
who were still alive and who could be linked to

original HNT records.5 The follow-up of the birth
cohort children as young adults (18–21 years of age)
during 2009–10 aimed to study the effect of nutritional shortage in early life on the amount and distribution of body fat and the development of type 2
diabetes and early markers of coronary heart disease.
The aim of expanding the cohort in 2010–12, to include parents and siblings of the birth cohort to constitute the Andhra Pradesh Children and Parents
(APCAPS) family study, was to explore the trans-generational effects of environmental and genetic risk
factors on cardiovascular and other chronic diseases.6–10 The main objectives in this phase were: (i)
to study whether parental deprivation in childhood
(assessed from socio-economic data and height and
leg length of the parents) is associated with cardiometabolic risk in the offspring; (ii) to explore differences between maternal and paternal influences on
offspring disease risk; (iii) to study whether nutritional supplementation for mothers in pregnancy attenuates this risk; and (iv) to explore differences in
cardiometabolic risk factors in children born before
and after the nutritional supplementation.

Who is in the cohort?
The Hyderabad Nutrition Trial, 1987–90
The Hyderabad Nutrition Trial evaluated the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme, a
national community outreach programme initiated in
1975 to improve the health, nutrition and development of children in India. Its central focus was the
improvement of nutritional status of pregnant and
lactating women and children less than 6 years of
age, and also included: early childhood education;
health, hygiene and nutrition education for the
mothers; and delivery of other national programmes
(immunisation, anaemia control and basic health
care) from the ICDS centres. The programme provided
free food in the form of a cereal-based meal prepared
from a corn-soya blend and soyabean oil. On average,
the meal provided 2.09 MJ and 20–25 g protein to
pregnant/lactating women and about 1.25 MJ and 8–
10 g protein to children up to 6 years of age. The
evaluation was conducted by the National Institute
for Nutrition (Hyderabad) during 1987–90, and was
funded by the Indian Council for Medical Research
and the United States Assistance for International
Development. Two adjacent administrative areas, 50–
100 km away from Hyderabad city (one with the ICDS
programme and the other awaiting implementation at
that time), were identified to allow a ‘controlled’
stepped wedge study design involving 29 villages (15
intervention and 14 control villages) of Ranga Reddy
district. All women in the reproductive age group of
13–45 years were identified in the initial household
enumeration. Women ‘at risk’ of pregnancy were
monitored and those who became pregnant were

followed closely during pregnancy until childbirth. A
clinical examination was carried out at each trimester;
attempts were made to weigh the newborns within
48 h of delivery and follow them for the 1st year of
life. No published findings exist, but historical records
suggest that approximately 4338 births took place. A
large amount of data was collected on the pregnant
women and ensuing offspring during HNT (sociodemographics; medical and obstetric history for
women; feeding and immunisation history for offspring; nutritional supplementation and anthropometrics for both). However, the data collected at
different time points were recorded in separate questionnaires which subsequently could not be linked
because of a lack of reliable linking identifier and so
is unavailable for use. Only birthweight data (which
as the primary outcome of the study was recorded in
additional files) are available for 603 (40%) of the
1492 children whose identities could be reliably
linked to the historical records (see below).

Long-term follow-up of the Hyderabad
Nutrition Trial
As HNT was not planned for long-term follow-up, the
records available could not be linked comprehensively
to individuals. An ecological approach was used in
which children of ages corresponding to 1987–90
births and permanently resident in the villages were
recruited and categorized as living in intervention or
control villages. This approach allows one to examine
what could be achieved in the long term by a nutritional intervention applied to villages from a pragmatic policy perspective.
In each village the names of the couples (i.e. parents) available from trial records were used to trace
the trial women. A brief socio-demographic questionnaire was completed for women who could be contacted, eliciting information about each child ever
borne by her. Local event calendar recall was used
to determine the date of birth in many cases.
Restricting the households to those with at least one
live child born 1987–90 provided the sampling frame
for the long-term follow-up study. Of the 2765 names
of trial couples available from historical records, 1963
(71%) could be contacted in 2003–05, of whom 1826
had at least one child born during the trial period
(1987–90): these constitute the APCAPS trial households. Children born during 1987–90 still alive at the
time of the study form the APCAPS birth cohort
(N ¼ 2601), and these together with the parents and
remaining siblings constitute the total membership of
the APCAPS family study (N ¼ 10 213). A probability
algorithm matching on family name pairs (women
and their spouses) and child information (date of
birth within 6–12 months, birth order, sex and maternal recall of child involvement in the study) was
used to retrospectively link the children from the
2003–05 survey to the historical records from the
trial. A total of 1492 (57%) children could be reliably

total of 1446 (56%) out of 2581 children still alive,
who were now young adults aged 18–21 years, were
examined during this phase.

How often have they been
followed up?

Third follow-up (APCAPS family study, 2010–12)
In 2010, the data collection was extended to the parents and siblings of the trial children, to establish a
family cohort study. A total of 6225 (61%) out of a
potential of 10 213 individuals participated during this
phase (these figures are provisional as data are still
being cleaned). In addition, 434 family members
from trial families with no living index children
were also recruited, yielding data on a provisional
total of 6659 participants in this phase.

First follow-up (mothers and children of the APCAPS
birth cohort in adolescence, 2003–05)
Only those children who could be reliably linked to
their historical records (N ¼ 1492) and their mothers
were invited to participate in this follow-up. An interviewer-administered questionnaire and clinical examination involving 1165 (78% response; 45% of trial
births) adolescent cohort members (intervention
group, N ¼ 654; control group, N ¼ 511) together
with a brief questionnaire and examination involving
1064 mothers (out of 1090 mothers alive, 97%
response) were carried out at clinics conducted in
the study villages.
Second follow-up (children of the APCAPS birth
cohort in young adulthood, 2009–10)
All 2601 trial children, irrespective of historical linkage, were eligible to participate in a study on DXA
measures of body composition and the propensity to
develop type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease. A

Attrition
The flow chart in Figure 1 shows attrition at each
stage of the cohort follow-up (for attrition by intervention status, see Appendix Figure 1, available as
Supplementary data at IJE online). At the time of
retracing of the cohort in 2003–05, about a quarter
of the families could not be contacted (25% of the
intervention group and 33% of the control group).
Anecdotal reports from the villagers suggested that
the untraced families were likely to have been temporary migrant workers (common at the time of harvest

1420

season) who were eligible to participate in the trial.
The response rate at the second follow-up (56%) was
considerably lower than the first follow-up (78%), possibly due to distance to the clinic. Clinics at the second
follow-up were conducted 1–2 h drive away at the
National Institute of Nutrition as DXA equipment was
required. This differed from the first follow-up, where
clinics were held in individual villages. The response
rate was particularly low among girls, since many of
them had migrated out of the area due to marriage
(girls frequently marry before the age of 20 years
in this area). Comparison of data collected on households surveyed in 2003–05 suggested that children
who took part in the clinics at the first and second
follow-ups were more likely to be males and students
than those who did not (Table 1). However, there was no
difference in birthweights (among the sub-group for
whom birthweight data were available). The 61%
response rate in the most recent follow-up is provisional
as the data are still being cleaned. A large proportion of
the offspring generation are now in young adulthood
and migration is anticipated to be an issue for both
men (mostly for work) and women (mostly for marriage). The exact proportion is difficult to predict and
may vary depending on local economic opportunities.
A positive factor in this is that migration for work
and marriage in this area tends to be local (one of the
neighbouring villages/towns or Hyderabad city which is
1–2 h drive away).

What has been measured?
The data collected in the three follow-ups are presented in Table 2. In the first follow-up, all data
were collected in clinics held at the villages where
the participants resided. In the second follow-up,
data were collected at a single clinic held at

the National Institute of Nutrition. In the third
follow-up, data collection was split between the
clinics conducted at the National Institute of
Nutrition (DXA scans and vascular measures) and
in the villages (remaining measures).
Socio-demographic, health and lifestyle data were
collected by questionnaire administered by a trained
interviewer. Socio-economic position was assessed
using the Standard of Living Index scale, a household
level asset-based scale devized for use in Indian surveys.11,12 Data on dietary intake (over the past year)
and physical activity (over the past week) were collected by semi-quantitative questionnaires previously
adapted and evaluated for use in this setting.13,14
Objective measures of physical activity (accelerometers and actihearts) were also collected on a
sub-sample. Anthropometric assessments included
weight (measured to the nearest 0.1 kg by digital
SECA machine) and height (nearest 1 mm by
Leicester plastic stadiometer, Chasmors, UK) and several circumferences (waist, hip, mid-arm, calf and
head by a non-stretch metallic tape). Skin folds
were measured at five sites (biceps, triceps, subscapular, suprailiac and calf) to the nearest 0.2 mm using
the Holtain caliper. Grip strength was measured by a
hand-held dynamometer (Grip D, Takei, Japan in the
second follow-up, and Lafayette 78010 in the third
follow-up), separately for each arm. Body composition
was assessed in the second follow-up by whole-body
scan performed by DXA (Hologic models Discovery A
or 4500W), after excluding pregnant women.
Standard Hologic software options were used to
define regions of the body. In the third follow-up,
body composition was assessed in the village clinics
using portable TANITA digital body composition analyser (TANITA BC 418 M57NA) which records the
total and segmental body composition measurements,
whereas DXA scans were done in a subset of subjects

at the National Institute of Nutrition. Blood pressure
was measured at the right arm in the sitting position
using an oscillometric device (Omron M5-I). Arterial
stiffness (augmentation index and pulse wave velocity) was measured in the supine position using the
Sphygmocor (Atcor Medical) in the first and second
follow-ups, and Vicorder (Skidmore Medical UK) in
the second and third follow-ups, respectively. Lung
function (forced vital capacity and expiratory
volume) was measured in the second follow-up by
MicroPlus spirometer (Micromedical), after three
acceptable blows from a maximum of eight blows;
Card-Guard Spiro-Pro was used for lung function
assessment in the third follow-up. Carotid intima
media thickness was measured at the near and far
carotid area close to the bulb by a B-mode ultrasound
scanner (Ethiroli Tiny-16a, Surabhi Biomedical
Instrumentation, India) and analysed using semiautomated software. Fasting blood samples were
collected and separated for storage, and assays for
haemoglobin, glucose, cholesterols (HDL, total), triglycerides and insulin (by ELISA) have been performed at each follow-up; in addition, liver and
bone functions have been assayed in second and
third follow-ups, and the C-reactive protein (Hs) in
the third follow-up only. Demographic and socio-economic data were collected from the official village
records in the local government (Panchayat) offices
in 2003–05 and are currently being compared with
data on village development available from census
records over the period 1981–2001 (2011 awaited) to
track the development of the villages.

No publications resulted from the initial trial except
an abstract in an internal publication based on
interim analyses which suggested an 88g higher birthweight in children born in the intervention villages.
A later reanalysis of available birthweights from the
trial data suggested a more modest 61g (95% CI
18–104, P ¼ 0.007) higher birthweight in the intervention village children.5 The details of the trial methodology and the subsequent attempt at tracing and
establishment of the birth cohort were published in
the primary manuscript from the first follow-up,5 and
more comprehensively in a PhD thesis (S.K. Kinra,
University of Bristol 2007, unpublished). The data
from the first follow-up were consistent with the
developmental origins of adult disease hypothesis,
suggesting a lower risk of cardiovascular disease (as
evidenced by arterial stiffness and insulin resistance)
in adolescents from the intervention villages, as compared with controls (see Table 3).5 They were also
14 mm taller, but not any more obese compared
with controls. In another analysis, relative leg length
was not found to be associated with nutritional

supplementation, challenging the use of leg length as
a biomarker for early childhood nutrition, which has
been based mainly on observational data.15 Other
publications from this cohort in the adolescent
phase have examined: (i) the social patterning of cardiometabolic risk (no clear associations between
socioeconomic position and cardiometabolic risk factors except adiposity which had a positive association
with socioeconomic position in adolescence); (ii) the
value of different anthropometric measures in predicting cardiometabolic risk (associations between several
anthropometric measures and cardiometabolic risk,
but no clear discrimination between them); and (iii)
the role of intergenerational undernutrition in conferring increased cardiometabolic risk (no association
between maternal leg length and offspring cardiometabolic risk except adiposity)(manuscripts submitted).
Data from the recently completed follow-up in young
adulthood are currently being analysed and several
manuscripts are under various stages of peer review:
early findings suggest a lack of long-term effect of
nutritional supplementation on body composition
and lung function in young adulthood, which were
more influenced by contemporary lifestyle factors.
Preliminary analysis of data for 20 villages from the
family study suggests a high prevalence of chronic
diseases and their risk factors in adults aged 30–84
years, such as: hypertension (BP4140/90 mmHg: men
20%, women 13%); overweight (BMI 5 25 kg/m2: men
18%, women 24%); underweight (BMI < 18.5 kg/m2:
men 31%, women 20%); and smoking (men 50%,
women 1%). With the current rising trends in chronic
diseases in low- and middle-income countries, the
results from this family cohort study in a largely
rural setting should provide crucial insights into the
potential reasons for these trends.

What are the main strengths and
weaknesses?
The Andhra Pradesh Children and Parents Study is a
unique family study in a transitioning rural population, that can provide valuable information on the
underlying patterns in risk factors for cardiometabolic
disorders. The inbuilt nutritional intervention component provides additional opportunities to evaluate
whether such programmes in an undernourished
population have long-term implications for the
health of subsequent generations. The original trial
with a controlled design should reduce, but does not
fully overcome, chances of bias and confounding. The
detailed phenotypic data and the collection of blood
or saliva samples from entire families for genetic studies provide a major intergenerational resource for
future research and should delineate the genetic and
environmental determinants and their contribution to
a host of outcomes in this population.
The main limitation of this cohort is the lack of
follow-up data during infancy and childhood (some
follow-up over infancy was conducted but data linkage is limited) and hence a loss of opportunity for
comparison of postnatal and childhood growth patterns between the two groups. We do not have prospectively collected data on infant and childhood
morbidity and mortality which could have provided
valuable clues to the impact of the nutritional supplementation programme on these indices. However, our
analysis of retrospectively collected data (using birth/
death data on all children ever born to the women,
collected at the time of initial tracing survey of 2003–
05) suggests some effects of nutrition on these indices.
The 1963 traced women had delivered a total of 8246
children (4.2 children per woman), of whom 952 had

ANDHRA PRADESH CHILDREN AND PARENTS STUDY

died. The estimated child death rates were 10% for
intervention and 13% for control areas; the broad consistency of the child death rates with Indian national
figures over that duration (11.5% under-five mortality in 1990) provides some reassurance on the completeness of the initial tracing exercise.16 The loss to
follow-up was substantial, therefore selection bias
cannot be ruled out. However, baseline comparisons
of available socio-demographic data on participating
and non-participating children did not suggest any
major differences (Table 1). The response rate also
compares favourably with other similar studies involving long-term follow-up of nutrition trials.14
The analyses by the original trial design are limited
by a lack of direct evidence on who took the nutritional supplement (primary analyses are ecological,
based on the area and time of birth) and the
amount of supplement consumed. In the trial, considerable efforts were made to ensure uptake of the supplement, including direct observation. This coupled
with a higher birthweight of children born in the
intervention area, comparable in magnitude to other
trials of nutritional supplementation, suggests that the
intervention was effective. Although the ecological
design could lead to an underestimation of the efficacy
of nutritional supplement, it provides a more pragmatic estimate of the effectiveness of such nutritional
supplement programmes in real-world situations,
which has important policy implications. Bias could
also have arisen from differing rates of urbanization
in the intervention and control groups. The study area
has over the past 10 years shown definite trends in
urbanization, with a large number of educational
institutes (schools, colleges and vocational/industrial
training centres) mushrooming in the area. The state
government also built a new international airport in
the vicinity, buying up agricultural land and contributing to a sudden increase in the socio-economic status
of many nearby villages and their inhabitants.
Although this may be a limitation for trial-based analyses, the natural experiment arising from the rapid
but uneven economic development of the area also
provides unique opportunities to investigate the
mechanisms by which socio-economic development and urbanization increase the risk of chronic
diseases.

KEY MESSAGES
 Long-term follow-up of the Hyderabad Nutrition Trial has created a major resource for contemporary
study of early life and trans-generational determinants of chronic disease.
 Initial findings demonstrated cardiometabolic benefits from early-life nutritional supplementation in
this undernourished population.
 Recent data suggest that lifestyle changes associated with rapid ongoing urbanization of the area may
play an important role in chronic disease risk in this transitional rural community.
