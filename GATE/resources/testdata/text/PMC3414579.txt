Abstract. Paraná state presents the fourth highest number of accumulated cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome
in Brazil. To map the risk areas for hantavirus transmission we carried out a study based on rodent trapping and
determined the anti-hantavirus seroprevalence in these animals and in the inhabitants of these localities. Overall
seroprevalence in rodents and humans were 2.5% and 2.4%, respectively. Eighty-two percent of the seropositive rodents
were genetically analyzed. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that hantaviruses from rodent samples cluster with Araucária
(Juquitiba-like) or Jaborá hantavirus genotypes. The Jaborá strain was identified in Akodon serrensis and Akodon
montensis, whereas the Araucária strain was detected in Oligoryzomys nigripes, Oxymycterus judex, A. montensis, and
Akodon paranaensis, with the latter species being identified for the first time as a natural host. These findings expose the
complex relationships between virus and reservoirs in Brazil, which could have an impact on hantavirus transmission
dynamics in nature and human epidemiology.
INTRODUCTION
Hantaviruses (Bunyaviridae) are emerging rodent-borne
and soricomorpha-borne viruses. Two diseases related to han-
tavirus infection are known, hemorrhagic fever with renal
syndrome (HFRS) occurring in Eurasia, and hantavirus pul-
monary syndrome (HPS), in the Americas.1,2
New World
hantaviruses are hosted by rodents of the Cricetidae family
(subfamilies Sigmodontinae, Arvicolinae, and Neotominae),
and by Soricomorpha mammals (families Soricidae and
Talpidae). Sigmodontine and neotomine rodents are the main
hosts of hantaviruses known to cause HPS. The hantavirus
genus, includes pathogenic and non-pathogenic viruses, with
more than 21 species and 30 genotypes.3–5
Since the first description of HPS in the Americas, hanta-
virus infections are considered a reportable disease in Brazil.
Until October 2011, a total of 1,404 cases were confirmed in
the country, with a 39% mortality rate (Secretary of Health
Surveillance, Brazilian Health Ministry, 2011). Southern Brazil
reports the highest number of hantavirus infection in Brazil
(~40%) and 38% of these cases occur in the state of Paraná.
In previous studies, we reported the complete genetic char-
acterization of the S and M segments from the Araucária
(Juquitiba-like) hantavirus involved in HPS cases in Paraná
state, South Brazil.6,7
This region borders Paraguay and
Argentina in the West and the states of Santa Catarina (South)
and São Paulo (North). Its main economic activities are agricul-
ture, reforestation, and ecotourism. Over the last 7 years our
group has monitored HPS cases reported in Paraná by per-
forming genetic analyses to determine the viral genotypes asso-
ciated with these cases and rodent trapping to identify the
species involved in hantavirus transmission. Epidemiological
studies have revealed substantial differences in antibody preva-
lence in humans and rodents among the various regions of South
Brazil, indicating that some communities are experiencing high
frequencies of virus exposures7–9
Since 2008, a collaborative
network involving our institute, the State Health Department
of Paraná and the Laboratory of Biology and Parasitology of
Wild Mammals Reservoirs in Fiocruz, Rio de Janeiro has
been responsible for carrying out programmed collections of
wild rodents in different ecosystems throughout the state of
Paraná and for collecting sera from individuals living in these
areas. The aims of this program are to determine the distri-
bution of wild rodents, the prevalence of anti-hantavirus anti-
bodies in rodents and humans, and to identify the virus
genotypes circulating in the surveyed areas. This information
is then used to delineate necessary control measures.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
A cross-sectional study was conducted from November
2006 through March 2011 to measure the anti-hantavirus IgG
antibody prevalence in rodents and human population. In
addition, the detected viruses were genetically characterized.
The procedures involving the use of human serum samples
and the manipulation of small mammals were reviewed and
approved by the Ethical Committee from the Brazilian Ministry
of Health (CONEP) under protocol no. 10573 for the human
samples, and no. IAP/PR 292/11 for the animal handling.
Study locations. Expedition sites were defined on the basis
of reported cases of HPS and on the environmental diversity
of the locations, taking into account vegetation type, eco-
nomic activity, and population density.
Rodent capture. A professional staff trained in the capturing
and handling of small mammals captured the animals using
Tomahawk (40.6 cm

and Sherman (7.6 cm

live traps set at different sites ranging from wild environments
to peridomestic areas (including altered habitats, secondary
forests, and rural areas. In addition, in the municipalities with
reported human cases, live traps were also set around probable
infection sites. Traps were baited with a mixture of peanut
butter, banana, oats, and bacon. The animals were identified
by morphologic characteristics and further by karyological and
genetic analyses. Blood and organs (lung, liver, kidney, and
spleen) were collected aseptically. Tissues were frozen in liquid

nitrogen and blood was kept at 4°C during transport to the
laboratory facilities. All procedures were performed after pre-
viously reported standards of biosafety.10
Antibodies assays. Rodent blood samples were screened for
immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti-hantavirus antibodies using an
indirect enzymatic immunoassay kit (Hantec, Curitiba, Paraná,
Brazil) employing a recombinant Araucária nucleoprotein,
according to the manufacture’s instructions.8
The rodents
found to be seropositive and reverse transcription-polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive to hantavirus were further
confirmed at species level by mitochondrial DNA (cyto-
chrome B) sequencing.11
Serum samples were collected from
members of the resident population by peripheral blood col-
lection, after they had signed a consent form to participate in
the study. Individuals < 18 years of age were excluded from
the study. Human sera samples were collected depending on
the availability of health care professionals to perform vein
puncture procedure at the same locals of rodent trapping.
Sampling of humans and rodents were done at same time.
Blood samples were screened for IgG anti-hantavirus anti-
bodies using the Hantec kit and positive samples were con-
firmed by an immunoblotting assay.
Hantavirus genetic characterization. Tissues (lung, liver,
and/or kidney) from antibody-positive rodents were analyzed
by RT-PCR to amplify the partial S segment. The molecular
tests were carried out using various sets of primers that have
been described previously.6,7,12
The PCR products were puri-
fied (High Pure PCR kit, Roche Inc., Mannheim, Germany)
and both strands were sequenced by the commercial Macrogen
facility (Seoul, Republic of Korea).
Sequence analyses. Genomic sequences of the partial S seg-
ment were aligned with hantavirus sequences retrieved from
GenBank. A total of 60 S segment sequences were analyzed,
including the main South American hantavirus genotypes, and
representative virus genotypes from North American and
Eurasia (see figure legends for details). Alignments were
constructed using the BioEdit v7.0.9.0 package. For phyloge-
netic inferences, the best-fit model of evolution and associated
parameters were calculated using ModelGenerator software
(http://bioinf.may.ie/software/modelgenerator). Phylogenies were
constructed using the Bayesian inference method (MrBayes
v3.1.2; http://mrbayes.csit.fsu.edu) and the maximum likeli-
hood (ML) method (PhyML v3.0.13
Bayesian analyses were
conducted under the general time reversible + gamma + pro-
portion invariant model. Two runs of four chains each (one
cold, three heated, temperature 0.20) were run for three mil-
lion generations; trees were sampled every 100 generations.
Convergence was assessed by using the average standard
deviation in partition frequency values across independent
analyses with a threshold value of 0.01; burn-in was set to
25%. For the ML estimation of phylogeny, the model of evo-
lution and parameters used were as described above, initial
trees were calculated using the BioNJ option and the tree
searching option was set to NNI. For both analyses, sequences
of the Hantaan and Seoul hantaviruses were used as outgroup
species. The node supports were calculated using the approx-
imate likelihood ratio test (aLRTs).14
RESULTS
Places of collection. A total of 11 trapping expeditions were
carried out until March 2011 with a general trap success near
4.5%. Figure 1 shows the regions studied and those having
hantavirus-positive results. Seven hundred forty-eight small
mammals were captured during the study; 667 of them were
rodents. The genus and/or species of these animals and their
distribution by region are shown in Table 1.
Prevalence of anti-hantavirus IgG in rodent and human
populations. A total of 2.5% (17 of 667) of the trapped
rodents were anti-hantavirus IgG-positive and 88% (15 of 17)

were also found to be hantavirus-positive by RT-PCR. Human
seroprevalence analysis was performed for a total of 1,038 sera
randomly collected from adults (> 18 years of age) without
reported classical HPS signs, in which an overall of 2.4%
(25 of 1,038) were anti-hantavirus IgG-positive (Table 2).
General Carneiro county, located in the southern area of
Paraná, is the region with the highest incidence of HPS cases.
In this locality, three capture expeditions were conducted at
three different times (November 2006, December 2009, and
March 2010). Regarding the other regions reported in this
study, one capture expedition was performed per locality.
The original vegetation of General Carneiro county was
Atlantic interior forest, but this has been gradually replaced
by pine tree reforestation, which represents the main eco-
nomic activity. The majority of the HPS patients in this region
worked in wood extraction in the secondary growth forests.7
A total of 214 small mammals were captured in three expedi-
tions and their identification is displayed in Table 1. Eight
seropositive rodents were detected in General Carneiro
County and this locality displayed the highest prevalence of
anti-hantavirus antibodies in human population, compared
with the other studied areas (8.4%), (Table 2).

ANTI-HANTAVIRUS SEROLOGICAL PROFILES IN SOUTH BRAZIL 373
The municipalities of Itambaracá and Jaguariaı́va, located in
the northeastern portion of Paraná, are both areas of savannah
and Atlantic forest fragments, where agriculture is the main
economic activity. A total of 128 small mammals were captured
in Itambaracá and Jaguariaı́va during the study (Table 1). Anti-
hantavirus antibodies were found in 5% of the captured ani-
mals, and no HPS cases have been reported in these areas. No
seropositive human samples were found in Itambaracá but
1.3% of the serum samples from Jaguariaı́va were positive.
Porto Rico county, located in the northwest part of Paraná,
borders with Mato Grosso do Sul. Tourism is its main source
of income. Only one rodent capture expedition was carried
out in this region, and the seropositivity prevalence for these
animals was 4.4% (Table 1).
Foz do Iguaçu (Iguaçu Falls), located in the western part of
the state, is a plateau region with a subtropical climate and
a subtropical rain forest, and is bordered by Paraguay and
Argentina. The main economic activity is tourism, electricity
generation, and trade. One hundred fifteen small mammals
were captured (Table 1) and all were found to be negative for
hantavirus antibodies. One seropositive human serum sample
was found in this region (0.5%).
Palmital and Laranjal counties are both located in Midwest-
ern region of Parana. Twenty-three rodents were trapped in
this region (Table 1), but none were positive for anti-hantavirus
IgG. However, HPS cases have been reported in this locality
and the human anti-hantavirus seroprevalence was 3.3%.
The city of Paranaguá is located in eastern Paraná on the
Atlantic coast. The main economic activities of the region are
related to the Paranaguá port and trade. Seventy-two small
mammals were caught here (Table 1), four of them were
positive for anti-hantavirus IgG (5.6%). Hantavirus pulmo-
nary syndrome cases have been reported in this locality.
Curitiba (the state capital of Paraná) and the metropolitan
region (Araucária and Campina Grande do Sul), located in the
eastern part of the state, have a humid subtropical climate. In
Curitiba, animals were trapped in peridomestic habitats near
the home of a patient who died of HPS. One hundred forty-
nine animals were caught (Table 1), however none of them
were found to be seropositive for anti-hantavirus antibodies.
Phylogenetic relationships among hantaviruses. The Bayes-
ian phylogenies of hantavirus partial S segment sequences are
shown in Figures 2 and 3. In Figure 2 the phylogenetic tree
corresponds to a 631 nt alignment, spanning nucleotides 152–
782 of S segment, and in Figure 3 the tree was constructed
using a subset of sequences from Figure 2, spanning nucleo-
tides 978–1,250 of S segment (nucleotide positions relative to
ARAUV strain AY740633). In both trees, genomic sequences
of hantaviruses identified in rodents from different localities
of Paraná grouped with high statistical support into the
Araucária (ARAUV) and Jaborá (JABV) clades. The major-
ity (7 of 12) of the S sequences belonged to the Araucária
clade. They were retrieved from two Oligoryzomys nigripes
specimens trapped in Paranaguá (10104 and 10091) and from
rodents 10056 (Oxymycterus judex) and 10028 (Akodon
montensis) collected in General Carneiro. Two additional
sequences were found in O. nigripes specimens captured at
Jaguariaiva (10351) and Itambaracá (10217) also belong to
this clade (Figure 2). An additional sequence retrieved from
a rodent captured in General Carneiro groups within the
ARAUV clade (Figure 3) with a posterior probability (pp) of
1. This rodent was identified as A. paranaensis by its morphol-
ogy, karyotype, and cytochrome B gene sequence.
Three viral genomic S sequences from rodents trapped in
General Carneiro in March 2010 and one collected in
Jaguariaı́va are placed in the Jaborá clade, with significant

from Brazil and Paraguay. An additional viral S sequence
from an A. serrensis specimen, collected in General Carneiro
in December 2009 is placed into Jaborá clade. All these ani-
mals were identified as A. montensis and A. serrensis by their
morphologies, karyotypes, and cytochrome B gene sequences
(Figure 2).
Maximum likelihood analyses (not shown, available upon
request) were also performed. Phylogenies obtained under
this method displayed the same topology as the Bayesian
analysis at the relevant nodes.
DISCUSSION
The HPS has been reported every year in the state of
Paraná since 1993, with the highest number of confirmed
cases occurring in southern and southwestern regions. The
biogeography with its particular vegetation landscape and
agricultural practices of these regions are distinct from other
regions in Paraná. Nevertheless, there is little information
available on the epidemiology, severity of disease, and ecol-
ogy of the hantavirus reservoirs.
Previously, we had reported a correlation between rodent
density and virus transmission, with the description of out-
breaks associated to pine tree reforestation area, with bamboo
blooming and mast seeding in southern Brazil.6
Subsequently,
we demonstrated the presence of the same hantavirus in three
different rodent species, and the co-circulation of two different
strains in the same rodent species, highlighting the complexity
of hantavirus transmission dynamics in nature.7
Similar find-
ings were previously reported for a Juquitiba-like hantavirus
harbored by two different rodent species in Uruguay,15
stres-
sing the point that hantavirus/reservoir species relationships
in South America might be more complex than the typically

comparison, a set of representative hantavirus sequences from Brazil, South America, North America, and Eurasia were included in the analysis.
Alignment used in the analysis was 631 nt long, spanning nucleotides 152–782 of S segment, respect to ARAUV strain AY740633. Hantaan

predominant association of one hantavirus strain and one
rodent reservoir species.
The most abundant rodent species captured during this study
were Akodon spp., followed by O. nigripes and Oxymycterus sp.,
both of the latter two have been previously implicated as poten-
tial pathogenic hantavirus reservoirs.7,15
The mean hantavirus
antibody seroprevalence found in rodents in this study was
2.5% (with a regional range of 0% to 5.6%). Similar seroprev-
alence values have been reported for other American coun-
tries, such as 3.5% in Mexico,16
1.4% in Chile,17
5.6% in
Argentina18
and 2.1% in Colombia.19
Recently, Armien and
others20
reported a rodent prevalence of antibodies against
Choclo virus ranging from 3% to 33% in neighborhoods
where HPS cases have occurred in western Panamá.
The mean value for hantavirus antibody seroprevalence in
humans in Paraná was 2.4%, but ranging from 0% to 8%,
depending on the region. The highest seroprevalence was
from individuals living in areas where HPS cases have been
reported. Seroprevalence results from other South American
countries and other regions in Brazil revealed different fre-
quencies of hantavirus exposure, such as 32.9% in western
region of Panama, 13.5% in Colombia,21
1.7% in Venezuela,22
4.7% in the Anajatuba municipality, state of Maranhão,
Brazil,23
10.9% in rural residents of the Anajatuba municipal-
ity,24
and 14.3% in Jardinópolis, southeastern Brazil.25
Such
differences in anti-hantavirus seroprevalence show high levels
of virus exposure in these populations and draw attention to
the possibility of asymptomatic or less virulent infections. In
agreement, a high incidence rate of hantavirus infections
without HPS was observed in four communities of western
Panama, where 70 individuals seroconverted during the sur-
veyed period (2001–2007) without HPS classical signs.20
The results from this study suggest a positive correlation
between the percentage of seropositive rodents and HPS
cases. On the other hand, anti-hantavirus IgG-positive rodent
reservoirs were identified in areas without reported cases,
suggesting that the geographic distribution of reservoir rodent
species alone is not enough to link a particular area with
disease risk. Other factors, such as seasonality, population
density, and human behavior must be included in risk ana-
lyses. Furthermore, HPS outbreaks have been linked to pre-
cipitation; however, climatic factors alone have not been
sufficient to predict the spatial-temporal dynamics of the
environment-reservoir-virus system.26
In all studied areas, two hantavirus genotypes were identi-
fied: Araucária and Jaborá. Phylogenetic analysis showed that
six rodent-borne hantaviruses cluster together with high sta-
tistical support with Araucaria (Juquitiba-like) virus identi-
fied in HPS cases and rodents from Brazil and Paraguay. It is
a homogenous group, sharing a 97%/100% of similarity at
Figure 3. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of partial S segment sequences from rodents captured in different Paraná localities (in boldface). For
comparison, a subset of the sequences shown in Figure 2 (from Brazil, Paraná, and Paraguay) was used in the analysis. Paraná strains are 272 nt
long and spanned nucleotides 978–1,250 of S segment, respect to ARAUV strain AY740633. Hantaan (HTNV) and Seoul (SEOV) sequences were
used as outgroup species. Posterior probabilities (pp) are depicted above the nodes. GenBank accession nos.: 13636: JN252309.

nucleotide/amino acidic level. It can be considered as a sister
clade to a group formed by several South American hantavi-
ruses, including pathogenic viruses like Andes, Lechiguanas,
and Araraquara, as well as non-pathogenic hantaviruses like
Maciel or Pergamino. Another five rodent-borne hantavi-
ruses from Paraná state form a monophyletic group with
Jaborá hantaviruses from Paraguay and Brazil (Santa Catarina
state). This group shares a 92%/99.9% identity at nucleotide/
amino acidic level, respectively, and contains viruses collected
mostly from A. montensis, and one from A. serrensis. The par-
tial S sequences analyzed here are not informative enough to
determine the relationships of this genotype with other South
American hantaviruses. It is noteworthy that the hantaviruses
identified in different Akodon species (A. montensis and
A. serrensis) from General Carneiro are more closely related
than the A. montensis-borne hantavirus from Jaguariaı́va
(10299), raising the possibility of a spillover infection from
A. montensis to A. serrensis. The phylogenetic tree displayed
in Figure 3 was constructed using a subset of sequences
encompassing nucleotides 978 to 1,250 from Araucaria virus
(AY740633). In this analysis a hantavirus genomic sequence
retrieved from an A. paranaensis specimen collected in Gen-
eral Carneiro was placed into the Araucaria group with high
statistical support (posterior probability of 1). The intra-
genotypic identity was 99.5%/100% at nucleotide/amino acidic
level, respectively.
In some regions, viral co-circulation was observed in trapped
rodents and both genotypes have been previously described
in South Brazil.7,9
Nonetheless, only the Araucaria hantavirus
has been detected in patients with HPS and the Jaborá virus
has not yet been associated with human diseases.9
Generally,
sigmondontine rodents have been captured in disturbed habi-
tats, such as cultivated fields, reforested areas, and peridomestic
settings. However, host population and pathogen prevalence
may vary locally and many rodent species show distinct habi-
tat preferences. Thus, additional local studies are essential to
define the risk of human disease.27
The presence of different rodent species within the same
natural setting and are infected by the same hantavirus
genotype, has been previously reported.7,9,17,28
In this study,
A. paranaensis was found for the first time to be infected with
Araucaria hantavirus, making a total of four different rodent
species that are associated with the same hantavirus genotype.
The impact of this number of host species on the natural
transmission cycle remains unclear. Jaborá virus was found
in the previously reported host (A. montensis) and also in
A. serrensis, which has not been previously identified as a
hantavirus reservoir. Interestingly, both species were cap-
tured in the same locality (General Carneiro) but in different
seasons (March 2010 and December 2009, respectively).
Hantavirus infections have been described with a wide vari-
ety of clinical forms, from asymptomatic to the classical clini-
cal manifestations of HFRS and HPS29,30
Although serologic
evidence indicated that hantavirus circulated in human and
rodents populations in all regions of the Paraná state, classical
HPS cases have not been reported in all regions (i.e., North-
western and Northeastern Paraná), suggesting that either
oligo/asymptomatic infections occurs. It cannot be ruled out
that occasionally hantavirus infection are not recognized or
reported. It seems likely that pathogen exposure varies among
these different areas, which could have practical implications
on disease transmission.
Recently, several novel hantaviruses with unknown patho-
genic potential were identified in widely separated geograph-
ical regions in a variety of soricomorpha mammals. Nothing is
known about the pathogenicity of these hantaviruses at the
moment, but finding these viruses among such evolutionary
divergent species, predicts that other groups of mammals
could also carry these viruses.31
Notably, in the Itambaracá
region, 27% of the animals captured was Didelphis albiventris.
Although serologically positive rodents were detected in this
region, RT-PCR analyses of lung samples from these animals
were negative for hantavirus.
It is important to mention that the main objective of this
study was to determine the serological status of the human
population and of the potential rodent reservoirs regarding
hantavirus exposure in different biomes of Paraná State. For
this reason, some expeditions were performed only once per
area. Hence, we are aware that these particular data relate
only to one period and reflect the landscape only for that
time. However, human seroprevalence data (from individuals
without previous HPS classical clinical presentations) and the
distributions of seropositive reservoir species will assist health
authorities in adjusting their prevention policies and defining
a permanent surveillance program for the entire region.
Although the impacts of environmental change and degra-
dation on the dispersion dynamics of the seropositive rodent
reservoir have not been evaluated, it has been suggested that
habitat fragmentation and the loss of species diversity may be
altering hantavirus infection dynamics.32
In the last several
decades, Paraná has witnessed high rates of environmental
degradation and human population growth. The impacts of
the consequential losses in biodiversity on human health
should be monitored and the complex factors involved in the
dynamics of hantaviruses in nature.
