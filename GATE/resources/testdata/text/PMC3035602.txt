Background: Data on birth outcome in women diagnosed with cancer before, during, or shortly
after pregnancy are very sparse. The purpose of this review was to summarize the existing
epidemiologic evidence of the adverse effect of breast cancer, cutaneous malignant melanoma,
and Hodgkin’s disease on birth outcome.
Methods: The MEDLINE database was used to review the literature systematically. Studies
that examined the following outcomes were included: preterm birth, low birth weight, low birth
weight at term, stillbirths, congenital abnormalities, male proportion of newborns, and mean
birth weight. Studies were grouped according to whether the woman had been diagnosed with
the specific cancer before, during, or shortly after pregnancy.
Results: Few data exist on birth outcome in women with breast cancer, melanoma, or Hodgkin’s
disease. The overall results from the limited number of studies, which included a comparison
group for birth outcome, were reassuring. However, for women diagnosed with breast cancer
before pregnancy, the only 2 studies that included comparison groups for birth outcome had
conflicting results regarding the risk of preterm birth and congenital abnormalities. ­Furthermore,
a recent cohort study of birth outcome in women who were diagnosed with Hodgkin’s disease
before pregnancy indicated a slightly increased risk of congenital abnormalities among the
newborns.
Conclusion: Overall, the existing studies offer reassuring results concerning the risks of
adverse birth outcome for women diagnosed with breast cancer, melanoma, or Hodgkin’s disease
before, during or shortly after pregnancy. A limitation of most studies was the imprecise risk
estimates caused by the small number of adverse birth outcomes and the lack of results stratified
by treatment. Therefore, international collaboration is necessary in the future, to obtain more
precise risk estimates for adverse birth outcomes, and to allow stratified analyses according to,
for example, treatment.

In Western countries women often postpone childbearing for personal or professional
reasons.1 The average age of Danish women at their first delivery has gradually increased
from 23 years in the 1960s to 29 years in 2008.2 Because the incidence rates of most
cancers increase with advancing age3 more women can be expected to be diagnosed
with cancer before childbearing, during pregnancy, or shortly after giving birth.
In Denmark, the most common malignancy affecting women of childbearing age
is breast cancer, and the second most common one is cutaneous malignant melanoma
(excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer).3 Hodgkin’s disease, whose incidence peaks in
early adulthood and thus also affects women of childbearing age, belongs to cancers

with a good prognosis.4 While in previous decades ­pregnancy
in patients with a history of cancer was discouraged,5 currently such pregnancies are treated with more optimism,
partly owing to the improved prognosis for several cancers,6
and partly because pregnancies subsequent to breast cancer,
for example, do not seem to adversely affect maternal life
expectancy.7–9 Because of a growing population of young
­cancer survivors, however, concerns have been raised about
the adverse effects of cancer and cancer therapy on the
offspring of the treated individuals.10 Offspring include
those conceived after completion of treatment, and fetuses
exposed to cancer therapy in utero. Data on birth outcome
in women diagnosed with cancer before, during, or shortly
after pregnancy are very sparse. Thus the purpose of this
review was to summarize the existing epidemiologic evidence
of the adverse effect of breast cancer, cutaneous malignant
melanoma, and Hodgkin’s disease on birth outcome.

Incidence of breast cancer, cutaneous
malignant melanoma, and Hodgkin’s
disease in women of childbearing age
Breast cancer
Breast cancer is the most common female cancer in ­Denmark with more than 4000 women diagnosed every year
(approximately 400 women are younger than 45 years of age
at the time of diagnosis).3 The age-standardized ­incidence rate
of breast cancer has almost doubled over the last 4 decades,
but this increase is mainly confined to women aged between
45 and 75 years.11 The incidence of breast cancer in ­pregnancy
is unknown, but is estimated to range from 1 in 3000 to 1 in
10,000 pregnancies.12

Cutaneous malignant melanoma
For decades, the incidence of cutaneous malignant melanoma
has been rising in most white populations around the world.13
In Denmark, the incidence of melanoma for women aged 15
to 34 years increased, on average, by 4.3% annually from
1970 to 1999,14 and in recent years, approximately 270 Danish
women younger than 45 years have been ­diagnosed annually
with melanoma. 3 It has been estimated that melanoma
represents approximately 8% of malignancies diagnosed
during pregnancy.15

Hodgkin’s disease
Hodgkin’s disease is characterized by a bimodal age ­incidence
curve, with the first peak in young adults and the second in
old-age groups.16 While age standardized incidence of
Hodgkin’s disease has been declining slightly over time, the

true incidence in older age groups has in fact decreased
substantially, whilst among young adults in industrialized
countries increases have been documented.16 In 2000,
29 women younger than 45 years of age were diagnosed with
Hodgkin’s disease in Denmark.17 Hodgkin’s disease during
pregnancy has a reported incidence ranging from 1 per
100,000 to 1 per 6000 deliveries.18,19

Definition of birth outcomes
This review focuses on the prevalence of specific birth outcomes for children of cancer patients. It does not examine
the risk of spontaneous or induced abortions, or diseases
diagnosed later in life. The birth outcomes examined are
defined below:

Preterm birth
Preterm birth is defined as delivery before 37 completed
weeks of gestation. The time of delivery depends both
on the natural course of the pregnancy and on clinical
­interventions, which may either shorten or prolong ­gestation.
Given this mixture of spontaneous events and effects of
medical interventions, the outcome of preterm birth itself
is heterogeneous.20

Low birth weight
Low birth weight (LBW) is defined as birth weight of less
than 2500 g. Children in this group represent a mix of
newborns whose growth is suboptimal, newborns delivered
early, and newborns who are small for genetic reasons.20 As
an alternative, some studies use “LBW at term” (defined
as birth weight less than 2500 g in those born at least 37 weeks
after conception), which suggests that the child remains
small despite having had adequate time for growth.20 The
presumption is that a child with LBW at term is likely to be
growth retarded.

Stillbirth
In Denmark stillbirth is defined as antepartum or intrapartum
fetal death after 22 completed weeks of pregnancy. Before
2004 only fetal deaths after 28 completed weeks of pregnancy
were considered stillbirths.

Congenital abnormalities
Congenital abnormalities occur in 3% to 5% of all livebirths. 20 However, each individual type of congenital
abnormality is rare, with the most common occurring in
about 1/1000 live births.20 The etiologic events that generate structural abnormalities typically occur within the first

Clinical Epidemiology 2011:3

Dovepress

2 to 8 weeks post-conception, but the recognition of the
abnormality may not occur until later in pregnancy (during
ultrasound evaluation), at birth, in early childhood, or in
adulthood, or the abnormality may never be recognized.

Male proportion of newborns
Approximately 51% of live-born children in Denmark are
boys.

Methods
The epidemiologic evidence of the possible adverse effect
of maternal breast cancer, melanoma, and Hodgkin’s disease
on birth outcome was examined via a systematic literature
review, including studies published before January 2010.
To review the literature, I searched the MEDLINE database and used the MeSH (Medical Subject Heading) terms
“breast neoplasms”, “melanoma”, and “Hodgkin disease”
[MAJR] (Major Topic headings only), respectively, in combination with “pregnancy” [MAJR], limiting the search to
include only studies on human females, in English, and with
an abstract. More studies were identified through communication with other researchers and by reviewing the reference
lists of relevant articles. Studies were classified as case-series,
if they reported birth outcome in a cohort of women with
cancer without comparing it with the outcome of a comparison group. However, if the authors computed risk estimates
for adverse birth outcome in comparison with the general
population, the study was classified as a cohort study.
The studies listed in Tables 1, 2, and 3 were selected
according to these criteria: studies of birth outcome in
women who were diagnosed with breast cancer, melanoma,
or Hodgkin’s disease at any time before pregnenancy (including childhood), during pregnancy, or within 2 years after
delivery were included. I selected only studies that examined
preterm birth, LBW (or LBW at term), stillbirths, congenital
abnormalities, male proportion of newborns, and/or mean
birth weight. I excluded studies that reported overall risks
of adverse birth outcome for survivors of different cancers
combined. In addition, I excluded reviews, case-reports,
case-series, and comments from the tables. However, given
that the overall evidence on the topic is sparse, there are some
references to case-series in the text.

Results
Below is a summary of the existing epidemiologic evidence of
the adverse effect of maternal breast cancer, melanoma, and
Hodgkin’s disease on birth outcome. The studies of birth outcome in women with, respectively, breast cancer, melanoma,

Birth outcome in women with cancer

and Hodgkin’s disease (Tables 1, 2, and 3) were selected
according to the inclusion criteria described under Methods.
No case-control study fulfilled the inclusion criteria.

Birth outcome in women
with breast cancer
Data on birth outcome in women diagnosed with breast
­cancer before pregnancy are very sparse. Small case series
have reported births of healthy children to women who
became pregnant after being diagnosed with breast cancer.21,22
The only 2 studies with a comparison group for birth outcome
that have been published, however, had conflicting results
on the risk of preterm birth and congenital abnormalities
after breast cancer (Table 1).23,24 In a registry-based cohort
study from Sweden, Dalberg et al examined 331 births
from 1973 to 2002, to women who were diagnosed with
breast cancer before pregnancy.24 Dalberg et al found that
a large majority of these births were free of adverse events,
and reported no increased risk of stillbirth or reduced birth
weight for gestational age. However, the study also reported
an increased risk of very preterm birth (,32 weeks) (odds
ratio [OR] = 3.2; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.7–6.0)
and LBW (,1500 g) (OR = 2.9; 95% CI: 1.4–5.8) and an
increased risk of congenital abnormalities (OR = 1.7; 95%
CI: 1.1–2.5) among children of breast cancer survivors,
compared with the general population. The increased risk
of congenital abnormalities was seen especially in the births
occurring in 1988 to 2002 (OR = 2.1; 95% CI: 1.2–3.7), which
the authors explained by an increased use of chemotherapy
in younger patients. The study, however, had no data on
the treatment of women with breast cancer. In contrast, a
nationwide Danish cohort study of 216 newborns of women
diagnosed with breast cancer before pregnancy found no
increased risk with respect to preterm birth, LBW at term,
stillbirth, and congenital abnormalities as well as mean birth
weight, compared with the outcomes of 33,443 births from
unaffected mothers, and with results unaltered by stratification by a treatment variable.23 As suggested by Dalberg et al
the different results in the Swedish and the Danish cohorts
may be caused by different degrees of misclassification of
the outcome variables between the registries or differences
in the use of adjuvant radiotherapy or systemic treatments
after breast cancer.
The Danish cohort study also observed an 8-fold
increased risk of preterm delivery among 37 women diagnosed with breast cancer during pregnancy, which reflected
a higher rate of elective early delivery, probably to allow an
early start to cancer therapy. After adjustment for gestational

age, there was a 240 g reduction (95% CI: -404; -76) in
mean birth weight for newborns of women diagnosed with
breast cancer during pregnancy. ­Furthermore, the study
showed a tendency towards an increased risk of preterm
birth for 442 women diagnosed with breast cancer within
2 years after delivery.23 The study found no increased risk of
stillbirth or congenital abnormalities in women diagnosed
with breast cancer during pregnancy or within 2 years of
delivery.
These findings corroborate the results of 2 earlier cohort
studies of birth outcome in women with breast cancer
­diagnosed during or shortly after pregnancy (Table 1).18,25
In these studies, however, the authors did not distinguish
between birth outcome in women diagnosed with breast
cancer during pregnancy and women diagnosed shortly after
pregnancy. Smith et al identified 423 cases of breast cancer
diagnosed from 9 months preceding delivery until 12 months
after delivery over a period of 6 years in ­California.18 After
adjusting the analyses for maternal age, the authors reported
an OR of 2.2 (95% CI: 1.7–2.8) for preterm birth, and an
OR of 2.0 (95% CI: 1.0–4.1) for very low birth weight.
The study concluded that the data were consistent with an
obstetric practice involving elective early delivery for cancer
patients. Likewise, a historical cohort study of 118 women,
who were pregnant within 9 months before or 3 months
after their first treatment for breast cancer, reported a higher
proportion of preterm births among offspring of women with
breast cancer compared with controls, mainly because elective cesarean sections were done more often to allow earlier
start to cancer therapy.25 In that study, only 2 stillbirths and
no congenital abnormalities were observed. The authors
also reported a lower mean birth weight after adjustment
for gestational age.
Three case-series of 24, 28, and 29 pregnant breast cancer
patients, respectively, have reported that ­chemotherapeutic
treatment in the second and third trimester caused no
­congenital abnormalities or other complications, except for
intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) in 1 case.26–28
Only 1 study examined the sex ratio among newborns
and found no substantial differences in proportions of boys
born to breast cancer patients compared with cancer-free
mothers.23 Thus, the findings did not corroborate a theory
of psychological stress29 (caused by a cancer diagnosis)
or potential mutagenic exposure (from chemotherapy or
radiation)30 reducing the male proportion of newborns. These
findings are in line with earlier studies that examined the sex
ratio for newborns of childhood cancer survivors and found
no significant alterations.31–33

In conclusion, the overall results regarding the birth
outcome among women with breast cancer are reassuring.
However, additional studies of birth outcome in women who
were diagnosed with breast cancer before pregnancy are
needed to resolve the discrepancy between the findings of
the Danish23 and the Swedish24 study.

Birth outcome in women
with cutaneous malignant melanoma
A nationwide cohort study from Denmark (Table 2) found
no excess risk with respect to preterm birth, LBW at term,
stillbirth, and congenital abnormalities among 620 newborns
of women who were diagnosed with melanoma before
pregnancy or 88 newborns of women who were diagnosed
during pregnancy, compared with, respectively, 29,788 and
4180 newborns of cancer free women.34 Furthermore, there
was no important difference in mean birth weight or male
proportion of newborns between women with melanoma and
comparison women. However, the study reported a prevalence
odds ratio (POR) of 4.6 (95% CI: 1.7–12.3) for stillbirth
among 351 newborns of women, who were diagnosed with
melanoma within 2 years after the time of delivery. This
finding, which was unexpected, has not been shown by other
studies, and may have been a chance finding.
Two other cohort studies have examined birth outcome
in offspring of women diagnosed with melanoma during or
shortly after pregnancy (Table 2).35,36 In a hospital-based
cohort study of 18 deliveries by women diagnosed with melanoma during pregnancy over a period of 30 years, there were
17 live births and 1 anencephalic stillbirth.36 The newborns
of women with melanoma had a lower mean birth weight
than newborns of women without cancer, but there was no
difference in mean gestational age. The authors suggested
that the differences in birth weight were due to IUGR secondary to the melanoma, its therapies, or its complications.
In that study, however, mean birth weights were based on
only 9 melanoma-exposed newborns and 9 newborns of
age-matched comparison mothers.
In a population-based cohort study, O’Meara et al
identified 149 women diagnosed with melanoma during
pregnancy and 263 women diagnosed within 12 months
after delivery over a period of 9 years in California.35 That
study and the Danish study34 were in agreement with respect
to the findings of no increased risk of preterm birth or low
birth weight among newborns of mothers with melanoma.
For women diagnosed during pregnancy, O’Meara and
colleagues reported an OR of 0.9 (95% CI: 0.5–1.6) for
preterm birth and an OR of 0.8 (95% CI: 0.3–1.8) for LBW,

adjusted for age and race. They found no fetal deaths in
the exposed group and no increased risk of adverse birth
outcome in women diagnosed with melanoma in the first post
partum year. The study did not examine the risk of congenital
abnormalities among newborns.
The overall results from these studies show no substantially increased risk of adverse birth outcome for women
with melanoma, with the possible exception of an increased
risk of stillbirth for newborns of women diagnosed within
2 years of delivery.

Birth outcome in women
with Hodgkin’s disease
More studies have examined birth outcome in women with
previous Hodgkin’s disease. Janov et al did not find any substantial increased risk of LBW and no congenital abnormalities
among newborns of 15 women with prepregnancy Hodgkin’s
disease compared with the general population (Table 3).37
Likewise, Swerdlow et al reported no increased risk of preterm birth, LBW, stillbirth, or congenital abnormalities among
49 children of 16 women and 11 men who had previously been
treated for Hodgkin’s disease compared with the general population (Table 3).38 Another study, which compared 52 births
by 29 women previously treated for Hodgkin’s disease with
births by the women’s siblings, found no overall increased
risk of congenital abnormalities and stillbirths combined
among children of Hodgkin’s ­disease patients. The study
also found no association of birth outcome with radiotherapy
alone (supra- or infradiaphragmatic), whereas women treated
with both chemotherapy and radiation were more likely to
give birth to an abnormal child (P = 0.047) (Table 3). The
3 ­studies, however, were all based on small study populations
and did not control for potential confounders.
Recently, a large cohort study of female survivors of
childhood cancer found that 19.2% of 337 women with
childhood Hodgkin’s disease had a preterm birth compared
with 12.6% among sibling controls (Table 3).40 Another study
reported 11 stillbirths among 729 births of female survivors
of childhood Hodgkin’s disease, corresponding to a relative
risk of 1.6 (95% CI: 0.64–4.03) (Table 3).41 In contrast,
a recent Danish cohort study of birth outcome in women
with previous Hodgkin’s disease found no increased risk
of preterm birth and only 1 stillbirth among 192 women, of
whom more than 75% had been diagnosed with ­Hodgkin’s
disease in adulthood ($20 years of age at diagnosis)
(Table 3).42 The results from the Danish study, however,
indicated a slightly increased risk of congenital abnormalities among newborns of women with previous Hodgkin’s

disease (POR = 1.7; 95% CI: 0.9–3.1). Furthermore, it was
reported, that the POR for congenital abnormalities increased
with calendar time of Hodgkin’s disease diagnosis (ie, for
1991–2000 the POR was 3.1 (95% CI: 1.4–6.9) compared
with POR = 1.0 (reference) for 1970–1980).42
The Danish study also reported increased risk estimates
for congenital abnormalities among newborns of women
who were diagnosed with Hodgkin’s disease during or
shortly after pregnancy, but these estimates were based on
few outcomes and were therefore imprecise. However, it
is important to emphasize that teratogens increase the rate
of specific, rather than all abnormalities, and the study was
unable to evaluate those.
Two studies reported an increased risk of preterm
birth for women diagnosed with Hodgkin’s disease during
pregnancy, which reflected a higher rate of elective early
delivery (Table 3).18,42 In contrast, a historical cohort study
by Lishner et al which included 40 births by women who
were pregnant between 9 months before and 3 months
after their first treatment for Hodgkin’s disease, reported
no increased risk of preterm birth or induced deliveries
(Table 3).19 Furthermore, the study indicated no difference
in mean birth weight compared with controls, while the proportion of stillbirths was not statistically different from that
of the general population. The study reported 1 child with a
congenital abnormality born to the only patient treated with
chemotherapy in the first trimester.
There was no evidence of any substantial decrease in the
male proportion of newborns among women diagnosed with
Hodgkin’s disease before pregnancy, indicating that earlier
treatment for Hodgkin’s disease is not a risk factor for early
male abortion.42
For newborns of women diagnosed with Hodgkin’s disease
during pregnancy, there was an increase in the male proportion, compared with newborns of comparison mothers, which
was surprising and could have been a chance finding.42
In conclusion, the overall results are reassuring regarding the risks of adverse birth outcome for women with
Hodgkin’s disease, although the possibility of an increased
risk of congenital abnormalities in newborns of women
diagnosed with Hodgkin’s disease before pregnancy cannot
be ruled out.

Discussion
Possible adverse effects of cancer
and cancer therapy on birth outcome
When cancer is diagnosed in pregnancy, there is often
a ­conflict between optimal maternal therapy and fetal

16

­ ell-being.5 The benefit of the diagnostic work-up, surgery,
w
radiotherapy and chemotherapy must be weighed carefully
against the risk to the fetus.12 Under these circumstances,
preterm labor is often induced as soon as the fetus becomes
viable, in order to allow amplification of therapy.12
The rationale for examining birth outcome in women
diagnosed with cancer within a few years after delivery is
that pregnancies starting before the diagnosis may be affected
by the preclinical cancer. A Swedish study, which compared
observed to expected rates of cancer during pregnancy and
during the first year after delivery, suggested that diagnosis is
often delayed to the postpartum period.43 A possible explanation for this delay could be that unusual signs and symptoms
may be ascribed to the pregnancy rather than the cancer.
For women who retain or regain fertility after cancer
treatment, an issue of great importance is their ability to
carry a pregnancy to term and give birth to a normal child.
Chemotherapy and radiotherapy may affect future pregnancies in cancer survivors by directly affecting the reproductive
tract or by causing mutations in germ cells.30 It is therefore
important to establish the magnitude of an increased risk (if
any) of adverse birth outcomes such as preterm birth, LBW
(or LBW at term), stillbirth, and congenital abnormalities.

Possible adverse effects of the cancer
itself on birth outcome
Little is known about exact mechanisms whereby maternal
cancer may pose risk to a developing fetus. In theory, several
factors might influence the fetus if the mother has malignant
disease:
• It has been proposed that the cancer may alter metabolism
and distribution of hormones and vitamins, some of which
are determinants for certain congenital abnormalities.44
• Cancer patients have an increased tendency to suffer from
febrile illness,5 and maternal fever in early pregnancy
has been associated with stillbirth 45 and congenital
abnormalities.45,46
• Malnutrition is more frequent in the patients. Maternal
undernutrition during pregnancy resulting in reduced
transfer of nutrients to the fetus may cause fetal
undernutrition and intrauterine growth retardation.47
Impaired fetal growth is strongly associated with neonatal
morbidity and mortality,48 and may also be associated
with diseases later in life.49
• Psychological stress related to severe life events (eg, a
cancer diagnosis) around the time of conception may
reduce the male proportion of newborns through differential conception or differential abortion of male ­embryos.29

Clinical Epidemiology 2011:3

Dovepress

Likewise, some studies have reported ­associations of
stress in pregnancy with preterm delivery,50,51 and congenital abnormalities.52

Possible adverse effects of specific cancer
therapy on birth outcome
Surgery

Most surgical interventions can be safely undertaken with
minimum risk during pregnancy, although there is almost
always some element of maternal–fetal conflict.53

Radiation
Radiation is commonly used for cancer diagnosis and
treatment. The fetus is sensitive to ionizing radiation, with
the brain being the most sensitive organ.54 During the periimplantation and immediate post-implantation periods,
radiation has an all or nothing effect, resulting in either
embryonic death or further normal development. Later in
pregnancy, radiation may cause congenital abnormalities,
IUGR, mental retardation, or childhood cancer.54 As a
result, the general recommendation is to postpone radiotherapy until after delivery.12 At the same time, births of
healthy children after radiotherapy of pregnant women for
breast cancer and supradiaphragmatic Hodgkin’s disease
have been reported (with appropriate shielding of the
fetus).19,55–57
In nonpregnant women of childbearing age, ionizing
radiation may damage ovarian function, cause premature
ovarian failure, or trigger germ cell mutations, which can
lead to congenital abnormalities in future offspring.30
Studies of women exposed to the atomic-bomb radiation
and their subsequently conceived offspring have indicated a
higher rate of spontaneous abortion, but showed no increase
in the risk of major congenital abnormalities compared with
the children of women from the general population.10 These
results corroborate studies of childhood cancer survivors
reporting no increased risk of congenital abnormalities
or genetic diseases in the offspring of women exposed to
­pre-gestational radiotherapy.58–61
It has also been postulated that maternal gonadal exposure
to radiation would decrease the male proportion of newborns by inducing recessive sex-linked lethal mutations.62
In ­addition, women previously treated with high-dose
abdominal radiotherapy have been found to have an increased
risk of spontaneous abortions,41,63,64 preterm deliveries,40 and
LBW infants58,59,63 during subsequent pregnancies.These
effects are most likely due to radiation-induced damage to
the women’s abdominopelvic structures.10,59

Clinical Epidemiology 2011:3

Birth outcome in women with cancer

Traditional ways to protect the ovaries against the
radiation damage are shielding of the ovaries and, in case of
pelvic lymph node irradiation, repositioning of the ovaries
out of the irradiation field (oopheropexy).65 Today, many
young patients needing radiotherapy (or chemotherapy) are
offered the option of cryopreservation of their ovarian tissue,
while recent studies of ovarian tissue autotransplantation
offer promising results.66

Chemotherapy
A potential teratogenic effect of chemotherapy ­during
pregnancy depends on the agent used, the timing of ­exposure,
the dose, and the characteristics affecting placental transfer.
Use of chemotherapy during the first trimester increases
the risk of miscarriage and congenital abnormalities. 26
A review of 139 cases of first-trimester exposure to chemotherapy reported a total of 24 (17%) infants with congenital
abnormalities after a single agent exposure, and a prevalence
of 25% after combination-agent exposure.67
Chemotherapy during the second and third trimesters
may increase the risk of preterm birth, IUGR, and stillbirth.12
Furthermore, the central nervous system continues to develop
after the first trimester, which makes it sensitive to insults
during the entire pregnancy.12 While exposure to chemotherapy after the first trimester does not cause macroscopic
anatomical defects, it may have long-term subanatomical
consequences, for example, by interfering with the neuronal
proliferation and migration.12 However, a study of late side
effects among 84 children whose mothers received chemotherapy, during pregnancy, for hematological malignancies
did not show impairments in learning behavior, or neurological abnormalities after a median follow-up of 18 years.68
Given all the evidence, it is generally recommended that
chemotherapy is delayed until after the first trimester.12
In nonpregnant women of childbearing age, chemotherapy
can adversely affect fertility.69 Damage to the ovarian tissue
depends on the agent used, the dose, and the age of the patient
at treatment.70 Furthermore, chemotherapy is potentially mutagenic10 with animal studies showing that it can cause mutations
in oocytes and increase the risk of fetal abnormalities.65

Endocrine therapy
The use of anti-estrogenic therapy, such as tamoxifen,
in ­pregnant breast cancer patients has been discouraged
because of teratogenic effects seen in animal models.12 Direct
evidence for teratogenesis in humans is limited, with only
isolated reports of rare forms of congenital abnormalities
associated with tamoxifen use.71

Conclusions and perspectives
This review summarizes the existing epidemiologic evidence
of the adverse effect of maternal breast cancer, melanoma,
and Hodgkin’s disease on birth outcome. On the whole,
existing studies offer reassuring results concerning the risks
of adverse birth outcome for women diagnosed with breast
cancer, melanoma, or Hodgkin’s disease before, during or
shortly after pregnancy. However, a limitation of most studies
was the imprecise risk estimates caused by the small number
of adverse birth outcomes and the lack of results stratified by
treatment. Since even countrywide data may be sparse, an
international collaboration is required in order to assemble
data on a sufficient number of births by women with cancer
in order to obtain more precise risk estimates for adverse
birth outcomes. Moreover, a larger number of birth outcomes
would allow stratified analyses according to, for example,
different treatment regimens, stages, and how close in time
the cancer diagnosis was to pregnancy. Information on these
clinical details could be obtained from hospital medical
records and clinical databases.
Very few studies document the long-term follow-up of
children exposed to maternal cancer and cancer treatment in
utero.68 Maternal cancer may affect not only birth outcome,
but also long-term health, as a consequence of intra-uterine
programming. Thus, large cohort studies with long term
follow-up are needed to evaluate the entire spectrum of
adverse effects of cancer or cancer treatment on offspring
of the patients.
