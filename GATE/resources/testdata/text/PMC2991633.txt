Despite interest in the built food environment, little is known about the validity of commonly used secondary data.
The authors conducted a comprehensive ﬁeld census identifying the locations of all food outlets using a handheld
global positioning system in 8 counties in South Carolina (2008–2009). Secondary data were obtained from 2
commercial companies, Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. (D&B) (Short Hills, New Jersey) and InfoUSA, Inc. (Omaha,
Nebraska), and the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC). Sensitivity, positive
predictive value, and geospatial accuracy were compared. The ﬁeld census identiﬁed 2,208 food outlets, significantly more than the DHEC (n ¼ 1,694), InfoUSA (n ¼ 1,657), or D&B (n ¼ 1,573). Sensitivities were moderate for
DHEC (68%) and InfoUSA (65%) and fair for D&B (55%). Combining InfoUSA and D&B data would have increased
sensitivity to 78%. Positive predictive values were very good for DHEC (89%) and InfoUSA (86%) and good for
D&B (78%). Geospatial accuracy varied, depending on the scale: More than 80% of outlets were geocoded to the
correct US Census tract, but only 29%–39% were correctly allocated within 100 m. This study suggests that the
validity of common data sources used to characterize the food environment is limited. The marked undercount of
food outlets and the geospatial inaccuracies observed have the potential to introduce bias into studies evaluating
the impact of the built food environment.

Researchers and health professionals increasingly recognize that the built environment influences health and health
behaviors, including dietary intake. Studies have shown a relation of availability and proximity of certain types of food
outlets in a neighborhood to dietary behaviors (1–3). The vast
majority of epidemiologic studies have relied on readily
available, secondary data sources, such as commercial data
obtained from InfoUSA, Inc. (Omaha, Nebraska) or Dun &
Bradstreet, Inc. (D&B) (Short Hills, New Jersey), telephone
company directories (yellow pages), Internet listings, or state
agency databases. The addresses are then geocoded without
any on-the-ground verification (‘‘ground-truthing’’) (1, 3, 4).
Through the use of geographic information systems (GIS),

the geospatial locations of food outlets can be identified
in order to quantify exposures such as distance to the nearest
supermarket. To date, only single-site or smaller-scale
studies have ground-truthed measures of the food environment (5–7).
Given epidemiologists’ general concern about measurement accuracy, surprisingly little information on sources of
measurement error exists in this field (8, 9). To our knowledge, only 1 study has examined the validity of a commercial
database and an Internet listing of food outlets, by conducting an independent ground-truthing effort in 12 Montreal,
Canada, census tracts (10). Indirect evidence comes from
a study on the agreement of a local government listing of

food outlets with field observation in Glasgow, United
Kingdom (11) and the agreement between InfoUSA and
field observation in Chicago, Illinois (12). These studies
were conducted in large urban areas and suggest that the
secondary data sources were quite complete. For instance,
Paquet et al. (10) reported sensitivities and positive predictive values (PPVs) of 84% and 90%, respectively, for
food stores in Montreal. The level of agreement between
listing and actuality was reported at 88% in Glasgow (11)
and above 80% in Chicago (12). However, no published
validity studies have been conducted in rural environments or larger urban areas in the United States. Moreover, previous experience by our group in 1 rural county
suggests that some secondary data sources may not be
complete (13).
Another concern with secondary data is its geospatial or
positional accuracy (14), a function of the completeness of
the address information and the road network database
which feed into the geocoding process. The accuracy of
several commercial geocoding vendors has been described
in detail (15). Many secondary data sources used to characterize the food environment provide geocoded addresses,
Am J Epidemiol 2010;172:1324–1333

but, to our knowledge, no study has specifically focused
on geospatial error related to geocoded food outlets.
The purpose of this study was to assess the validity of 3
readily available, secondary data sources on food outlets
within an 8-county region of South Carolina by conducting
a comprehensive field census, including ground-truthing
and ascertainment of geographic coordinates. We assessed
validity by considering both count accuracy and geospatial
accuracy and the influence of level of urbanization.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study region

This study was part of a larger effort to develop spatial
accessibility measures of the built food environment for
urban and rural areas. The geographically contiguous area
included 1 urban county (Richland) and 7 rural counties
(Calhoun, Chester, Clarendon, Fairfield, Kershaw, Lancaster, and Orangeburg) in the Midlands region of South Carolina (Figure 1). The study area covered 5,575 square miles
(8,920 km2) and a population of more than 620,000. The

1326 Liese et al.

study was reviewed by the institutional review board of the
University of South Carolina and considered exempt.
Data sources

Data on food outlets were obtained from 3 secondary data
sources. We obtained the Licensed Food Services Facilities
Database, which we have used previously (13), from the
South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental
Control (DHEC) in the summer of 2008. This database lists
all facilities that sell prepared foods in South Carolina. Simultaneously, we obtained commercial data from D&B. We
obtained commercial data from InfoUSA in February 2009
after recognizing that the addition of another data source
would facilitate our fieldwork.
D&B and InfoUSA listings were queried for specific North
American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes corresponding to facilities that sell food. These included supermarkets and other grocery stores retailing a general line of
food (445110), convenience stores (445120), pharmacies and
drug stores (446110), gas stations with convenience stores
attached (447110), other gas stations (447190), discount department stores or dollar stores (452112), warehouse clubs
(452910), supercenters (452910), all other general merchandise stores (452990), specialty food stores (e.g., meat
(445210), fish (445220), or fruit/vegetable (445230) markets,
bakeries (445291), confectionery stores (445292), or other
specialty stores), all other miscellaneous retailers except tobacco stores (453998), full-service restaurants (722110),
commercial cafeterias (722212), limited-service restaurants
(722211), and snack and nonalcoholic beverage bars
(722213). The D&B listing contained up to 5 NAICS codes
per food outlet, while the InfoUSA data contained 2 codes.
The DHEC database was queried for code 206 (food service
facilities) and code 211 (grocery stores).
Because of our focus on the retail food environment, 2
types of outlets were ineligible: 1) sporadic or temporary
food vendors operating at sports stadiums or theme parks
and 2) outlets that served special populations (e.g., cafeterias in schools or nursing homes, assisted living facilities or
institutionalized settings, military settings, and catering
businesses without a retail store). We further excluded
bars/nightclubs (722410) and liquor stores (445310).
Each database was reviewed separately, and duplicate
entries (based on name and address) and outlets that were
ineligible because of geography or outlet type were removed. The databases were then merged by name and
address into a single comprehensive database that listed
each food outlet only once. We started with the DHEC
data, into which we merged D&B data and subsequently
InfoUSA data. However, we retained all attribute information from each source for each outlet, including a variable
indicating the data source from which a given attribute had
originated. This comprehensive master listing of unique
food outlets served as the basis of our subsequent validation effort. Because data cleaning and merging was very
time-consuming, the data cleaning and managing process
was conducted on a county-by-county basis so that fieldwork could start as soon as the first counties’ data had been
managed.

Validation effort

We conducted the field census to verify the presence and
location of each food outlet listed in our comprehensive
database and to identify new, unlisted outlets. A navigational system was used to locate listed outlets during the
ground-truthing trips. Six persons were trained under a standardized protocol, and they took 114 trips entailing 7,000
miles (11,200 km), averaging 2–3 trips per week. The fieldwork began in September 2008 and concluded in July 2009.
Once the address and food outlet were located, the global
positioning system (GPS) coordinates were recorded using
a Trimble Juno ST GPS receiver (3–5 m spatial accuracy;
Trimble Navigation Ltd., Sunnyvale, California) and ArcPad 7.1 software (ESRI, Redlands, California). Facilities
were classified as ‘‘located and open’’ (outlet was in database and found open for business), ‘‘closed’’ (outlet located
but closed permanently), ‘‘not found’’ (outlet not located at
the reported address), or ‘‘ineligible’’ (outlet located but
gave no indication of being a retail food outlet (e.g., private
residence, gas station without a convenience store)). GPS
coordinates and outlet name, type, and address were also
recorded for new food outlets discovered during the fieldwork (i.e., outlets not listed in the databases). In Table 1,
these new outlets are shown as ‘‘found but not listed’’ relative to each of the 3 databases.
For outlets not found in a first ground-truthing attempt,
we conducted additional Internet queries and, if needed,
contacted the outlet. A second systematic ground-truthing
attempt was made on all of these outlets toward the end
of data collection. This effort would also have captured outlets that had relocated in the interim. If this second attempt
was successful, an outlet was classified as ‘‘located and
open’’ and, if not, as ‘‘not found.’’ For the small number
of food outlets (D&B, n ¼ 37; InfoUSA, n ¼ 16) with only
a post office box listed, an attempt was made to locate
them.
Classiﬁcation of food outlet type

To differentiate the types of food outlets, we used NAICS
definitions as the basis of outlet type groups (‘‘supermarkets
and grocery stores,’’ ‘‘convenience stores,’’ ‘‘pharmacies
and drug stores,’’ ‘‘dollar and variety stores,’’ ‘‘warehouse
clubs,’’ ‘‘specialty stores,’’ ‘‘full-service restaurants,’’
‘‘franchised limited-service restaurants,’’ and ‘‘nonfranchised limited-service restaurants’’) but with a number of
refinements. Warehouse clubs and supercenters were
grouped with supermarkets and grocery stores. Snack and
nonalcoholic beverage bars were assigned to the limitedservice restaurant category, which was further divided to
differentiate franchised outlets (Arby’s, Burger King, etc.)
from nonfranchised outlets.
For all listed food outlets, the NAICS codes were reviewed carefully by multiple team members and corrected
manually as needed to remove obvious assignment errors.
For all outlets that could not be assigned with certainty, we
conducted Internet research and ultimately telephoned the
outlet. For newly discovered outlets, the type was assigned
during ground-truthing.

Census tract characteristics

Outlets were assigned to their US Census tract and a corresponding level of urbanization based on the 2000 RuralUrban Commuting Area (RUCA) codes, obtained from the
US Department of Agriculture (16). The 10 tiers were consolidated into 4 as described previously (17): urban core

The validation effort identified 2,208 open food outlets,
including 160 supermarkets/grocery stores, 504 convenience stores, 120 dollar/variety stores, 79 drug stores, 36
specialty stores, 650 full-service restaurants, 312 franchised
limited-service restaurants, and 347 nonfranchised limitedservice restaurants. Fifty-two percent of all food outlets
were located in Richland County, an urban area.
Table 1 shows the results of the validation effort relative
to the secondary data sources. The DHEC database had the
largest number of listed outlets (n ¼ 1,694), including 417
stores and 1,277 restaurants. InfoUSA listed 1,657 outlets
(672 stores and 985 restaurants), and D&B listed 1,573 (751
and 822, respectively). Of the outlets listed by the DHEC,
only about 11% could not be confirmed by the field census,
because they were either not found (6.6%) or closed (4.2%).
The InfoUSA database was similar: Approximately 14% of
listed outlets were not confirmed, largely because they were
not found (9%) or closed (3.5 %). In contrast, D&B had the
highest proportion of outlets that could not be confirmed
(22%), with 12.3% not being found, 2.3% not being found
because of a post office box address, and 7.6% being closed.
We found 183 food outlets during the validation effort
that were not listed in any of the 3 data sources. The number
of outlets newly found ranged from 696 for the DHEC to
774 for InfoUSA to 985 for D&B. The majority of outlets
discovered relative to the DHEC were stores, which is not

RESULTS

Type of Food Outlet

food outlets that were listed and found to be open (i.e.,
‘‘located and open’’/(‘‘located and open’’ þ ‘‘found, not
listed’’)). The PPV was calculated as the fraction of all listed
food outlets that were ‘‘located and open’’ during the field
census (i.e., ‘‘located and open’’/(‘‘located and open’’ þ
‘‘closed’’ þ ‘‘not found’’)). Because of structural zeroes,
chance-adjusted kappa statistics could not be computed.
We calculated confidence intervals for each of these proportions by approximating the binomial distribution with
a normal distribution. Fisher’s exact tests were used to evaluate accuracy. Analyses were conducted using SAS software
(version 9.2; SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina).
All distance analyses were conducted within ArcGIS software (version 9.3; ESRI) using 2008 street network data
from the Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding
and Referencing System (18). We computed the geospatial
accuracy of outlets by calculating the Euclidean distance
between the geocoded outlet location and the GPS location
recorded in the field. This analysis was limited to located
and open outlets because of the need to have both geocodes
from the database and the GPS coordinates from the field
census. Similarly, correct allocation of outlets to US Census
tracts was determined through comparison of tracts of geocoded outlets with tracts of GPS-verified outlets. Finally, to
combine our evaluation of count accuracy with the geospatial
accuracy, we calculated the proportion of open outlets that
had been both listed in the respective database and geocoded
to a position less than 100 m from the actual GPS-recorded
location. While this calculation is identical to sensitivity, it
could be conducted only on the outlets that were located and
open (i.e., a subset of the validity analysis data).

surprising since many stores do not fall under the licensing
regulations enforced by the DHEC. However, 183 restaurants were discovered that were not listed by the DHEC. The
InfoUSA database was missing 349 stores and 425 restaurants. The D&B database was missing 330 stores and a very
large number of restaurants (n ¼ 655). Combining D&B and
InfoUSA data sources would have yielded 2,170 unique,
listed outlets (944 stores and 1,226 restaurants), of which
1,727 were found and open during the field survey (data not
shown). Relative to this combined listing, 481 new outlets
were discovered during fieldwork.
Validity statistics are shown in Table 2. For all outlets
combined, the sensitivity (i.e., the ability to capture food
outlets that truly existed in the area) was moderate to fair
(68% for the DHEC, 65% for InfoUSA, and 55% for D&B).
Both D&B and InfoUSA exhibited moderate sensitivities
for food stores (63% for D&B and 61% for InfoUSA) and
ranked significantly better than the DHEC (43%). This implies notable undercounting of existing stores for both commercial databases—approximately 37% for D&B and 39%
for InfoUSA. Combining the 2 commercial databases would
have resulted in a significant improvement in sensitivity for
food store identification (81%). Likewise, for supermarkets
and grocery stores, all 3 databases had similar levels of
sensitivity, ranging from 71% to 76%. The combination of
InfoUSA and D&B data would have resulted in a marked
improvement in supermarket sensitivity (90%). Combination of DHEC and InfoUSA data or DHEC and D&B data
or data from all 3 sources would have resulted in very good
to excellent sensitivity for the identification of supermarkets: 86%, 91%, and 97%, respectively (data not shown).
No data are shown for DHEC with respect to dollar/variety
stores and drug stores/pharmacies because of the DHEC’s
focus on licensing prepared food outlets. Had we excluded
dollar/variety stores and drug stores/pharmacies entirely
from the DHEC analysis, the sensitivity of the overall food
store category would have improved to 54% (95% confidence interval: 51, 58). Of the other types of food stores,
D&B and InfoUSA demonstrated very good sensitivities at
80% or above for drug stores and pharmacies.
With respect to restaurants (lower portion of Table 2), the
DHEC database had very good sensitivity of 86% (i.e., an
undercount (discovery rate) of only 14%). InfoUSA (67%)
and D&B (50%) performed significantly worse. With respect
to ranking of the 3 databases across type of restaurants, the
findings were consistent. Combining the 2 commercial databases would have resulted in a significant increase in sensitivity compared with using either one alone, but sensitivity
would not have reached the level of the DHEC database.
However, the combination of DHEC data with InfoUSA or
D&B data or the combination of all 3 databases would have
resulted in excellent sensitivity values for restaurants (91%,
92%, and 94%, respectively; data not shown).
Table 2 also shows PPVs, which can also be interpreted as
verification rates—that is, the likelihood that a listed food
outlet actually existed and was open. PPVs ranged from
good to very good: 78% for D&B, 86% for InfoUSA, and
89% for DHEC, for all food outlets combined. For stores,
the PPV was highest (92%) for the DHEC database, significantly better than for any other database (D&B, 76%;

InfoUSA, 82%). For restaurants, DHEC and InfoUSA data
performed equally well with respect to PPV (88% and 90%,
respectively), with D&B performing significantly worse
(79%). This ranking between the databases remained consistent for all 3 restaurant types.
We subsequently evaluated potential differences in the
validity of the 3 secondary data sources across levels of
urbanization (Table 3). For stores, there were no marked
differences between levels of urbanization in any of the 3
databases or the combined D&B and InfoUSA databases. A
similar picture emerged for restaurants, the exception being
significantly higher sensitivity in urban areas in the D&B

data. We additionally evaluated the potential influence of
tract racial composition or poverty on the validity estimates
but found no evidence for any systematic differences (data
not shown).
Geospatial accuracy statistics are shown in Table 4 and
are limited to located and open outlets because of the need
to have both geocodes from the database and GPS coordinates from the field census. The geospatial accuracy varied
widely, with a median Euclidian difference of 76 m (n ¼
1,507) for DHEC, 92 m for D&B (n ¼ 1,213), and 92 m for
InfoUSA (n ¼ 1,434). The percentage of outlets for which
the geocoded position was less than 100 m from the GPS

location ranged from 53% for both D&B and InfoUSA to
56% for DHEC. The correct allocation of outlets to census
tracts was high (83%, 85%, and 84% for DHEC, D&B, and
InfoUSA, respectively). No notable differences in the median distances were observed by type of food outlet; hence,
all outlet types were combined. As expected, the Euclidian
distance differences were lowest for the urban areas for all 3
data sources, intermediate for the suburban and large-town
areas, and highest for small-town and rural areas (P <
0.0001 for all contrasts).
Finally, to combine our evaluation of count accuracy with
the geospatial accuracy, we calculated the proportion of
open outlets that had been both listed in the respective database and geocoded to a position less than 100 m from the
actual GPS-recorded location (Table 5). Overall, between
29% (D&B) and 39% (DHEC) of open food outlets were
listed with geocodes that would place them less than 100 m
from their actual location. DHEC performed best for restaurants (49%) and worst for stores (24%). D&B and InfoUSA
did not differ significantly for stores (31% vs. 29%), but
InfoUSA performed significantly better than D&B for restaurants (38% vs. 28%).
DISCUSSION

With increasing adoption of the socioecologic paradigm
in public health, the number of studies employing GIS techniques has increased dramatically. As recently reviewed by
McKinnon et al. (4), the majority of GIS studies of the food
environment have relied on readily available, secondary
data sources, with very few epidemiologic researchers conducting any verification (6, 19, 20). In contrast to previous
findings (10–12), our study demonstrates that secondary
data sources harbor substantial amounts of error, including
undercounts, overcounts, and geospatial inaccuracies.
To our knowledge, the only other comprehensive validity
study on the built food environment published to date was
conducted in 12 census tracts in the Montreal metropolitan
region (10). Paquet et al. (10) reported undercounts of 16%
for a commercial listing of 171 food stores and 34% for an
Internet-based listing of 123 food stores. In our study of 8
rural and urban counties and 2,208 food outlets, undercounts
of food stores were much more common, with 37%–39% of
food stores and 33%–50% of restaurants not being listed in
the D&B and InfoUSA databases. Furthermore, we found
Am J Epidemiol 2010;172:1324–1333

1331

the lowest undercount error in the DHEC database, from
which only 14% of restaurants were missing (but 57% of
stores, which largely are not subject to DHEC regulatory
permitting). Similar to our study, Sharkey et al. (7) reported
that 21% of the 213 food stores found during ground-truthing
in a rural environment were not listed; however, they did not
present any other validity statistics in the published article.
In our study, combining both commercial databases would
have decreased the undercount to 19% of stores and 24% of
restaurants, and combining all 3 sources would have decreased the undercounts to 12% and 6%, respectively. Thus,
combining multiple data sources and including data from
state regulatory agencies is a strategy future investigators
should consider in order to reduce undercount error.
Overcount error—that is, listed outlets’ either not being
present or being found to be closed upon ground-truthing—
occurred less frequently (22% in D&B, 14% in InfoUSA,
and 11% in DHEC). Had we not conducted substantial data
cleaning efforts to remove ineligible outlets prior to the field
census, the overcount error would have been much higher.
In the Glasgow study, Cummins and Macintyre (11) aimed
at characterizing food availability and prices in stores, reporting that approximately 88% of listed outlets were confirmed as open (i.e., an overcount error of only 12%).
Unfortunately, combining multiple data sources would have
a detrimental effect on this type of error, in that it increases
the overcount.
Similar to a previous study of commercial listings of
physical activity facilities by Boone et al. (21), our study
suggests that, given the dominating nature of undercount
error, it is unlikely that the effects of under- and overcounting would balance each other out. This implies that epidemiologic studies using commercial secondary data to
characterize the food environments of participants would
most likely have underestimated participants’ true exposure
status. Furthermore, our data suggest that the ratio of undercount error to overcount error may differ somewhat by
type of food outlet. In future studies, investigators should
consider carefully the amount and type of error specific to
the food-outlet type under study in selecting secondary data
sources.
We also evaluated the geospatial accuracy of the geocodes contained in each of the 3 databases. Geospatial accuracy factors into any analysis involving distances or
precise geospatial location relative to predefined boundaries. For instance, in research on the built food environment, exposures typically include distance measures such as
proximity to the nearest supermarket (6) or count or density
measures such as number of supermarkets per square mile in
a 1-mile (1.6-km) buffer around a residence (3) or within
a census tract (1). We found varying levels of geospatial
accuracy for the 3 data sources, using the conservative Euclidian (straight-line) distance estimate. Correct allocation
to a census tract was high (above 80%), recognizing that in
the rural parts of our area census tracts tended to be very
expansive. However, on a smaller spatial scale, marked inaccuracies became apparent, with only about 50% of outlets
being allocated correctly within 100 m. Furthermore, we
attempted to estimate the overall amount of error by combining geospatial accuracy with an estimate of undercount.

1332 Liese et al.

The results were sobering: Only 29%–39% of outlets listed
had geocodes that placed them within 100 m of their actual
location. Therefore, studies relying on very small definitions
of neighborhoods may incur larger amounts of error than
those utilizing larger buffers or census tracts.
There were several limitations to our study. Given the
large geographic area and the number of food outlets, data
collection spanned 10 months. Therefore, our data represent
more of a period prevalence, while other efforts represent
a period as short as 1 month (10). While we attempted to be
comprehensive in our field efforts, we cannot exclude the
possibility that some outlets were overlooked. In addition,
some food outlets discovered may have been listed in a secondary data source but under an NAICS code that we did not
request (e.g., code 446191—food/health supplement stores).
For the geospatial accuracy analyses, GPS data were used as
the gold standard, although this method is subject to some
error which can arise from issues including satellite-related
errors, signal propagation errors, and receiver errors (22).
Lastly, it is important to keep in mind that commercial
databases are developed for purposes other than scientific
research.
Our study is likely the largest of its kind to date, in terms
of both geographic area and the number of food outlets. We
included food stores and restaurants, since both have been of
interest in research on the built food environment (3, 23),
and rural areas, which have not been included in previous
studies. We have presented our key results according to
specific types of food outlets within the larger groups of
stores or restaurants, to assist in future efforts that may be
tailored to specific outlets.
In summary, relying exclusively on a single secondary
data source for characterizing the built food environment
may introduce substantial bias into epidemiologic studies
evaluating the impact of the food environment on health
behaviors or outcomes. In addition, in the area of policy
research, secondary data sources increasingly serve as metrics for public health policy recommendations. For instance,
the recent State Indicator Report on Fruits and Vegetables
published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(24) provides data on policy and environmental supports for
fruit and vegetable consumption based on D&B data. In
light of our findings, future investigators should consider
combining at least 2 secondary data sources to improve
levels of accuracy, if secondary data sources cannot be supplemented with extensive ground-truthing efforts.
