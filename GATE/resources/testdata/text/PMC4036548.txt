Viruses 2014, 6 1898
Received: 24 February 2014; in revised form: 4 April 2014 / Accepted: 8 April 2014 /

Abstract: The recent discovery of genetically distinct hantaviruses in multiple species of
shrews and moles prompted a further exploration of their host diversification by analyzing
frozen, ethanol-fixed and RNAlater®
-preserved archival tissues and fecal samples
from 533 bats (representing seven families, 28 genera and 53 species in the order
Chiroptera), captured in Asia, Africa and the Americas in 1981–2012, using RT-PCR.
Hantavirus RNA was detected in Pomona roundleaf bats (Hipposideros pomona) (family
Hipposideridae), captured in Vietnam in 1997 and 1999, and in banana pipistrelles
(Neoromicia nanus) (family Vespertilionidae), captured in Côte d’Ivoire in 2011.
Phylogenetic analysis, based on the full-length S- and partial M- and L-segment sequences
using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods, demonstrated that the newfound
hantaviruses formed highly divergent lineages, comprising other recently recognized bat-
borne hantaviruses in Sierra Leone and China. The detection of bat-associated hantaviruses
opens a new era in hantavirology and provides insights into their evolutionary origins.
Keywords: hantavirus; Chiroptera; evolution
1. Introduction
Hantaviruses (genus Hantavirus, family Bunyaviridae) possess a negative-sense, single-stranded,
tripartite segmented RNA genome, consisting of large (L), medium (M) and small (S) segments,
encoding an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), envelope glycoproteins (Gn and Gc) and a
nucleocapsid (N) protein, respectively [1]. To date, 23 hantaviruses, hosted by reservoir rodent species,
have been recognized as distinct species by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses [2].
Several of these rodent-borne hantaviruses cause acute, febrile diseases of varying clinical severity and
lethality in humans, known as hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and hantavirus cardiopulmonary
syndrome [3]. Though once believed to be restricted to rodents (order Rodentia, family Muridae and
Cricetidae), the reservoir host range of hantaviruses is far more expansive, as evidenced by the detection
of divergent lineages of hantaviruses in multiple species of shrews and moles (order Soricomorpha,
family Soricidae and Talpidae) throughout Asia, Europe, Africa and North America [4–19].
Despite their phylogenetic relatedness to the European mole (Talpa europaea) within the
Laurasiatheria [20,21], as well as their rich genetic diversity, vast geographic range and ability to host
many disease-causing viruses [22–24], bats (order Chiroptera) have not been extensively studied as
potential reservoirs of hantaviruses. Although serological evidence of hantavirus infection was
reported in the common serotine (Eptesicus serotinus) and greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus
ferrumequinum) captured in Korea [25], genetic analysis of hantavirus isolates from these bat species
suggested laboratory contamination [26].
The genetic diversity of newfound hantaviruses recently detected in insectivorous bats preclude any
possibility of contamination: Mouyassuévirus (MOYV) in the banana pipistrelle (Neoromicia nanus)
from Côte d’Ivoire [27]; Magboi virus (MGBV) in the hairy slit-faced bat (Nycteris hispida) from
Viruses 2014, 6 1899
Sierra Leone [28]; Xuan Son virus (XSV) in the Pomona roundleaf bat (Hipposideros pomona) from
Vietnam [29]; Huangpi virus (HUPV) in the Japanese house bat (Pipistrellus abramus) and Longquan
virus (LQUV) in the Chinese horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus sinicus), Formosan lesser horseshoe bat
(Rhinolophus monoceros) and intermediate horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus affinis) from China [30]. The
primary goal of this multi-national collaborative study was to extend the search for hantaviruses in bats
and to obtain more of the MOYV and XSV genomes. Our data indicate that bat-borne hantaviruses and
Nova virus, a hantavirus hosted by the European mole, comprise a highly divergent phylogenetic
lineage, suggesting that ancestral bats and/or soricomorphs, rather than rodents, may have served as the
early reservoir hosts of primordial hantaviruses.
2. Results and Discussion
2.1. Hantavirus Detection and Sequence Analysis
Exhaustive attempts to detect hantaviruses were unsuccessful in nearly all of the 454 bat tissue
samples (Table 1 and Figure 1), despite employing oligonucleotide primers and PCR cycling
conditions used to find MOYV [27] and XSV [29]. In addition, hantavirus RNA was not detected in
any of the 79 rectal swab and fecal samples. Because LQUV was previously found in four species of
horseshoe bats in China [30], we expected to find the same or a similar hantavirus in the greater
horseshoe bat, captured on Jeju Island in Korea. However, this was not the case, in spite of using LQUV-
specific primers. Nevertheless, we did manage to obtain more of the MOYV and XSV genomes. That
is, the original report of MOYV in the banana pipistrelle (Figure 2A,B) was based on a 423-nucleotide
region of the L segment [27]. Through repeated trial-and-error efforts, suitable primers were designed
to obtain an additional 1268 nucleotides of the L segment (Table 2).
In addition, Arai and colleagues previously reported a novel hantavirus, designated XSV, in one of
five Pomona roundleaf bats, captured during July 2012 in Xuan Son National Park in Phu Tho
province in northern Vietnam [29]. In analyzing archival kidney tissues from 44 Pomona roundleaf
bats trapped in Tuyê
n Quang and Quang Nam provinces, hantavirus L-segment sequences were detected
in five animals (Figure 2C,D). Although a 15.7%–19.2% difference was found at the nucleotide level with
prototype XSV, the high amino acid sequence similarity was consistent with these sequences representing
genetic variants of XSV. Pair-wise alignment and comparison of the full-length S segment of XSV,
amplified and sequenced from four bats (Table 2), indicated sequence similarity of 58.9%–60.3% at the
amino acid level with LQUV, the only other bat-borne hantavirus for which the entire S segment has
been sequenced. And sequence analysis of a 663-nucleotide (221 amino acid) region of the Gc envelope
glycoprotein-encoding M segment showed that XSV differed by >45% from representative
hantaviruses harbored by rodents and most soricomorphs. Collectively, the high level of sequence
divergence in the N protein and Gc glycoprotein between XSV and other hantaviruses suggests that it
might represent a new hantavirus species, using the guidelines proposed by Maes and co-workers [31].
However, the definitive taxonomic classification of XSV and other bat-borne hantaviruses must await
their isolation in cell culture.

2.2. Nucleocapsid Secondary Structure
In employing software available on the @NPS structure server [32], the overall predicted secondary
structures of the N proteins were similar. That is, despite the relatively low amino acid sequence
similarity among the rodent-, shrew-, mole- and bat-borne hantaviruses, the N protein comprised two
major α-helical domains packed against a central β-pleated sheet (Figure 2E). However, the central
β-pleated sheet motif of XSV, including the RNA-binding region (amino acid positions 175 to 217),
was unlike that of other hantaviruses, even that of LQUV, which more closely resembled murid
rodent-borne hantaviruses, such as Hantaan virus (HTNV 76-118), Dobrava virus (DOBV Greece) and
Seoul virus (SEOV 80-39) (Figure 2E). The distinctive α-helix motif between two β-strands of the
Viruses 2014, 6 1903
RNA-binding region, observed in the prototype mole-borne hantavirus, Nova virus (NVAV MSB95703),
as well as HTNV and SEOV, but not in LQUV, may have a significant effect on binding specificity.
2.3. Phylogenetic Analysis
Phylogenetic analyses, based on S-, M- and L-genomic sequences, indicated that XSV and MOYV
shared a common ancestry with other bat-borne hantaviruses (Figure 3). In all analyses, NVAV from
the European mole segregated with the bat-associated hantaviruses, which was reminiscent of trees
based on the complete mitochondrial genomes of the European mole and bats [20,21]. The basal
position of chiropteran-borne hantaviruses and selected soricomorph-borne hantaviruses, such as Nova
virus in the European mole, Thottapalayam virus in the Asian house shrew and Imjin virus in the
Ussuri white-toothed shrew, in phylogenetic trees based on the S- and L-genomic sequences suggests
that soricomorphs and/or chiropterans, rather than rodents, may have been the primordial mammalian
hosts of ancestral hantaviruses (Figure 3). Geographic-specific clustering was evidenced by the close
phylogenetic relationship between prototype XSV VN1982 from Phu Tho province and XSV F42640
and XSV F42682 from neighboring Tuyê
n Quang province in northern Vietnam. On the other hand,
XSV F44583, XSV 44601 and XSV 44580 from Quang Nam province in central Vietnam clustered
together. Although limited differences were present in phylogenetic trees based on each segment, tree
topologies were generally congruent and supported by significant bootstrap values (>70%) and
posterior node probabilities (>0.70).
Figure 3. Phylogenetic trees were generated by maximum-likelihood and
Bayesian methods, using the GTR+I+Γ model of evolution, based on the S-, M- and
L-genomic sequences of hantavirus strains. Because tree topologies were nearly identical
using RAxML and MrBayes programs, the trees generated by MrBayes were displayed.
The evolutionary relationships between Xuan Son virus (XSV), Mouyassuévirus (MOYV)
and other bat-borne hantaviruses, including Magboi virus (MGBV), Longquan virus (LQUV)
and Huangpi virus (HUPV), are shown, as are representative soricomorph-borne hantaviruses,

2.4. Bats as Hosts of Hantaviruses
The phylogeny of bats is not fully resolved [21]. The order Chiroptera was traditionally divided in
two suborders, Megachiroptera and Microchiroptera. However, due to the paraphyly of the
Microchiroptera, a new taxonomic nomenclature, comprising the suborder Yinpterochiroptera
(megabats or fruit bats in the Pteropodidae family in Megachiroptera and a few Microchiroptera
families) and Yangochiroptera (the remaining Microchiroptera families), has been proposed [33]. In
the former classification, bat species hosting hantaviruses belong only to the Microchiroptera suborder,
Viruses 2014, 6 1905
but in the Yinpterochiroptera-Yangochiroptera classification, they belong to both suborders,
suggesting that primordial hantaviruses may have emerged in an early common ancestor of bats.
Within the Microchiroptera, hantaviruses are found in bats belonging to four phylogenetically
distant families, namely Hipposideridae (Old World leaf-nosed bats) and Rhinolophidae (horseshoe
bats) in the suborder Yinpterochiroptera, and Nycteridae (hollow-faced bats) and Vespertilionidae
(vesper bats) in the suborder Yangochiroptera. The families Hipposideridae and Vespertilionidae are
among the most speciose insectivorous bats, with member species distributed across Africa, Europe,
Asia, the Americas and Australia. Their vast geographic distribution provides unlimited opportunities
to search for related bat-associated hantaviruses.
Compared to the multitude of hantaviruses reported from approximately 50% of soricomorph
species tested [34,35], the cumulative number of newly recognized bat-borne hantaviruses is exceedingly
low, if one considers the 533 bat samples tested in the present study, along with the nearly 1200 bat
specimens analyzed in four other studies [27–30]. The modest proportion of hantavirus RNA detection
in bat tissues may be attributed to the highly divergent nature of their genomes, as well as the very
focal or localized nature of hantavirus infection, small sample sizes of bat species, primer mismatches,
suboptimal PCR cycling conditions, and variable tissue preservation with degraded RNA [27,29].
Alternatively, bats may be less susceptible to hantavirus infection or may have developed immune
mechanisms to curtail viral replication and/or persistence. For answers to such questions, and myriad
others, reagents need to be developed and multidisciplinary collaborative studies must be designed to
collect optimal specimens to isolate and characterize these newfound bat-borne hantaviruses. Only
then will a better understanding be gained about their evolutionary origins and phylogeography,
co-evolution history, transmission dynamics and pathogenic potential.
3. Experimental Section
3.1. Samples
Archival frozen, ethanol-fixed and RNAlater®
-preserved tissues from bats, captured during 1981–2012
in Brazil, China, Cote d’Ivoire, Guinea, Korea, Republic of Georgia, Vietnam and the United States
(Figure 1 and Table 1), were tested for hantavirus RNA by RT-PCR, using newly designed and
previously employed oligonucleotide primers [12,18,27,29]. Of the 533 samples tested, the majority
consisted of lung (310) and kidney (51) tissues (Table 1). RNA extracted from rectal swabs and feces
(79) were also tested. Bats were from seven families (Hipposideridae, Molossidae, Nycteridae,
Pteropodidae, Phyllostomidae, Rhinolophidae and Vespertilionidae), 28 genera and 53 species
(Figure 1). The University of Hawaii Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved the use
of archival tissues as being exempt from protocol review.
3.2. Genome Detection and Sequencing
Total RNA extraction from tissues, using the PureLink Micro-to-Midi total RNA purification kit
(Invitrogen, San Diego, CA, USA), and cDNA synthesis, using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis
Systems (Invitrogen) with random hexamers, were performed as described previously [9,12,18].
Oligonucleotide primers used to amplify S-, M- and L-genomic segments of bat-borne hantaviruses are
Viruses 2014, 6 1906
listed on Table 3. First- and second-round PCR were performed in 20-μL reaction mixtures, containing
250 μMdNTP, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 1 U of Takara LA Taq polymerase (Takara, Shiga, Japan) and 0.25 μM
of each primer [16]. Initial denaturation at 94 °
C for 2 min was followed by two cycles each of
denaturation at 94 °
C for 30 s, two-degree step-down annealing from 46 °
C to 38 °
C
for 40 s, and elongation at 72 °
C for 1 min, then 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °
C for 30 s, annealing
at 42 °
C for 40 s, and elongation at 72 °
C for 1 min, in a GeneAmp PCR 9700 thermal cycler
(Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA) [6,9,11,12,16]. PCR products, separated using MobiSpin S-400
spin columns (MoBiTec, Goettingen, Germany), were sequenced directly using an ABI Prism 3130
Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) [9,16].

3.3. Phylogenetic Analysis
Maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods, implemented in RAxML Blackbox webserver [36]
and MrBayes 3.1 [37], under the best-fit GTR+I+Γ model of evolution [38] and jModelTest version 0.1
[39], were used to generate phylogenetic trees. Two replicate Bayesian Metropolis–Hastings Markov
Chain Monte Carlo runs, each consisting of six chains of 10 million generations sampled every 100
generations with a burn-in of 25,000 (25%), resulted in 150,000 trees overall. The S, M and L
segments were treated separately in phylogenetic analyses. Topologies were evaluated by bootstrap
analysis of 1000 iterations, and posterior node probabilities were based on 2 million generations and
estimated sample sizes over 100 (implemented in MrBayes) [18].

4. Conclusions
Mammalian reservoirs of zoonotic viruses typically do not display host restrictions within a given
taxonomic order. Also, infection is usually chronic, persistent and subclinical. For example, rodents of
multiple genera and species, belonging to four subfamilies in the order Rodentia, serve as reservoirs of
hantaviruses in Eurasia, Africa and the Americas and do not exhibit clinical disease or survival
disadvantage. In addition, recently, hantaviruses exhibiting far greater genetic diversity have been
detected in healthy-appearing shrews and moles representing many genera in six subfamilies within the
order Soricomorpha in Eurasia, Africa and North America. Similarly, as mentioned earlier, bat species
belonging to both suborders of Chiroptera host hantaviruses without evidence of apparent disease.
However, some might contend that the low prevalence of hantavirus RNA in a few bat species, and the
absence of hantavirus infection in the majority of bat species analyzed to date, would argue against a
long-standing hantavirus-reservoir host relationship, and instead support spillover or host switching.
That is, the gleaning feeding behavior of some bats, such as Nycteris, presents the possibility of
acquired infection from excreta of well-established terrestrial reservoirs of hantaviruses. However, this
seems highly improbable because bat-borne hantaviruses are among the most genetically diverse
described to date.
With the discovery of divergent hantavirus lineages in three taxonomic orders of placental
mammals, there is renewed interest in investigating their genetic diversity, geographic distributions,
and evolutionary dynamics [34,35]. Newfound knowledge that insectivorous bats harbor a distinctly
divergent lineage of hantaviruses emphasizes the truly complex evolutionary origins and phylogeography
of a group of viruses once thought to be restricted to rodents. At this point, it would not be surprising if
hantaviruses are found in small mammals belonging to other taxonomic orders, such as Erinaceomorpha
(hedgehogs) and even Afrosoricida (tenrecs). Such anticipated discoveries may provide additional
insights into the dynamics of hantavirus transmission, potential reassortment of genomes, and
molecular determinants of hantavirus pathogenicity. As importantly, a sizable expansion of the
hantavirus sequence database would provide valuable tools for refining diagnostic tests and enhancing
preparedness for future outbreaks caused by emerging hantaviruses.
