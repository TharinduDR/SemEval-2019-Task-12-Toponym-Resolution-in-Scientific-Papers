A current view of the emergence of pandemic influenza viruses envisages a gene flow from the aquatic avian
reservoir to humans via reassortment in pigs, the hypothetical “mixing vessel.” Understanding arising from
recent H5N1 influenza outbreaks in Hong Kong since 1997 and the isolation of avian H9N2 virus from humans
raises alternative options for the emergence of a new pandemic virus. Here we report that H9N2 influenza
viruses established in terrestrial poultry in southern China are transmitted back to domestic ducks, in which
the viruses generate multiple reassortants. These novel H9N2 viruses are double or even triple reassortants
that have amino acid signatures in their hemagglutinin, indicating their potential to directly infect humans.
Some of them contain gene segments that are closely related to those of A/Hong Kong/156/97 (H5N1/97, H5N1)
or A/Quail/Hong Kong/G1/97 (G1-like, H9N2). More importantly, some of their internal genes are closely
related to those of novel H5N1 viruses isolated during the outbreak in Hong Kong in 2001. This study reveals
a two-way transmission of influenza virus between terrestrial and aquatic birds that facilitates the generation
of novel reassortant H9N2 influenza viruses. Such reassortants may directly or indirectly play a role in the
emergence of the next pandemic virus.
The introduction and subsequent spread in the human pop-
ulation of influenza A viruses with a novel hemagglutinin (HA)
or NA subtype leads to an influenza pandemic. In the last
century, four influenza pandemics occurred, resulting in signif-
icant mortality and morbidity. Genetic investigations revealed
that these pandemic strains were partially or entirely derived
from the viruses of avian origin (13, 27, 28) and that most of
them first appeared in southern China, a hypothetical influ-
enza epicenter (22).
The accumulated experience of the last decade reminds us
that a new influenza pandemic may happen again in the near
future since influenza viruses with pandemic potential continue
to emerge and reemerge in the southern China region (4, 5,
26). A recent example is the highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza
virus which caused an outbreak in the live-poultry markets of
Hong Kong (23) and subsequently spread to humans and
caused the loss of six human lives in 1997 (26, 29). On this
occasion, a pandemic was averted by the depopulation of all
live poultry across Hong Kong (24). The continuing outbreaks
of H5N1 infections in live-poultry markets of Hong Kong in
2001 (5) and 2002 (authors’ unpublished data) highlight the
continuing pandemic threat posed by these viruses.
Separate from the H5N1 influenza virus, another subtype of
influenza virus, H9N2, has become panzootic in the last decade
and has been isolated from different types of terrestrial poultry
worldwide (1–3, 9). Two distinct lineages of H9N2 viruses,
represented by prototype A/Duck/Hong Kong/Y280/97 (Dk/
HK/Y280/97) and A/Quail/Hong Kong/G1/97 (Qa/HK/G1/97)
viruses, have become established in terrestrial poultry, pre-
dominately in chicken and quail, respectively (7, 9). A Qa/HK/
G1/97-like virus is thought to have been involved in the gen-
eration of the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus in 1997 (8). H9N2
viruses of each lineage have been isolated from humans (14,
17), and the Dk/HK/Y280/97-like lineage has been isolated
from pigs in southern China (16). These H9N2 influenza vi-
ruses have acquired receptor-binding specificity to sialic acid
with terminal 2-6 Gal linkage found on human cells (10, 15).
Thus, H9N2 viruses along with the H5N1 viruses are high on
the list of candidates that could potentially cause the next
human influenza pandemic.
It has never been possible to be prepared for an influenza
pandemic. As a step toward this and to gain a better under-
standing of the generation of influenza viruses of pandemic
potential, live-poultry markets in Shantou, southeastern China,
have been investigated for influenza viruses since July 2000.
Genetic analysis of representative H9 subtype influenza viruses
isolated from ducks revealed that most of the tested duck H9
subtype HAs appear closely related to those of H9 viruses
isolated from chickens. However, some of the viruses contain
internal genes that are closely related to the genes of the
H5N1/97 or Qa/HK/G1-like viruses or to those of the novel
H5N1 reassortants isolated in Hong Kong in 2001 (H5N1/01),
thus providing evidence that those H5N1/01 viruses might be
generated in domestic ducks in the southern region of China.

Phylogenetic analyses of each gene segment of these H9N2
influenza viruses from ducks has suggested that they are dou-
ble or even triple reassortants. Sequence analyses demonstrate
that some of these novel reassortant H9N2 viruses in ducks still
retain the amino acid signatures in their HA and are therefore
compatible with receptor binding preference for humans. This
finding raises the possibility of the generation of a pandemic
influenza strain directly from aquatic birds in southern China
and highlights the need for further study of the influenza ecol-
ogy in this region as an important component of pandemic
preparedness.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sampling and virus isolation. Between July 2000 and November 2001, 498
influenza virus strains were isolated from 2,485 aquatic birds sampled in live-
poultry markets in Shantou in the Guangdong Province. Most of these aquatic
birds sold in Shantou live-poultry markets, mainly domestic duck, originate from
several neighboring provinces such as Jiangxi, Hunan, and Zejiang. Fecal or
cloacal swabs were collected from six live-poultry retail markets and one whole-
sale market. Virus isolates were subtyped by using a panel of reference antisera
recommended by the World Health Organization, as described previously (25).
Genetic and phylogenetic analysis. Viral gene sequencing and analysis were
carried out as described previously (5, 6). In brief, viral RNA was extracted from
virus-infected allantoic fluids with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth,
Calif.) and reverse transcribed, and PCR amplification was carried out (primer
sequences available upon request). The PCR products were sequenced by using
the Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit (Applied Biosys-
tems) on a Perkin-Elmer model 377 XL DNA sequencer. Sequence data were
assembled and edited with the Wisconsin Package Version 10.0 (Genetics Com-
puter Group, Madison, Wis.). Sequence alignment analysis was performed with
Genedoc, Version 2.3 (available at http://www.psc.edu/biomed/genedoc/gddl
.htm).
For comparison, sequences from H9N2 and H5N1 virus lineages established in
southern China since the mid-1990s, including Dk/HK/Y280/97-like, Qa/HK/G1/
97-like, Goose/Guangdong/1/96-like (Gs/Gd/96, H5N1), and those newly
emerged H5N1 viruses from Hong Kong in 2001 (H5N1/01, genotypes A, B, C,
D, and E), were included for phylogenetic analyses (5). In addition, five H9N2
duck viruses isolated in Hong Kong during 1976–1979 were also sequenced (21,
25). In this study, regions used for the phylogenetic analyses are as follows: PB2
1036-2165, PB1 66-1368, PA 1415-2151, HA 43-1047, NP 55-962, NA 41-1393, M
74-889, and NS 39-842.
Nucleotide sequence accession numbers. The nucleotide sequences obtained
from this study are available from GenBank under accession numbers AF523372
to AF523519.
RESULTS
In the influenza surveillance studies of Shantou during 2000-
2001, 498 influenza virus strains were isolated from aquatic
birds, mainly domestic ducks, comprising subtypes H1 to H12
and N1 to N9. Fifty-three of these isolates were of the H9
subtype, an isolation rate around fourfold higher than that
found in the 1970s (21, 25). In contrast, chicken and other
terrestrial poultry had a more restricted range of subtypes and
lineages, largely confined to subtypes H9 and H6 (authors’
unpublished data). To understand the relationship between the
H9 viruses from ducks and those circulating among terrestrial
birds, 14 representative duck H9 viruses were genetically ana-
lyzed (Table 1). Twelve of them were identified as H9N2, while
two of them were H9N1 viruses.
Phylogenetic analysis. Phylogenetic analysis of the H9 HA1
section shows that all of the H9N2 viruses are incorporated
into the lineage represented by Ck/HK/G9/97 or Dk/HK/
Y280/97 (Fig. 1a). All of these viruses were derived from CK/
BEI/94 or Ck/HK/739/94-like viruses. Topologically, the HA1
genes of four viruses (Dk/ST/2134/00, Dk/ST/1042/00, Dk/ST/
1043/00, and WDk/ST/4808/01) are more closely related to
Ck/Bei/1/94, which caused the first outbreak in chickens in
Guangdong Province in 1994, while another five viruses (Dk/
ST/1796/00, Dk/ST/2143/00, Dk/ST/2144/00, Dk/ST/1881/00,
and Dk/ST/1605/00) seem to form an intermediate group more
closely related to the 1997 isolates, i.e., Dk/HK/Y280/97. There
are an additional three viruses (Dk/ST/2088/01, Dk/ST/830/00,
and Dk/ST/2102/00) that are more closely related to the recent
H9N2 viruses isolated in 1999. This suggests that the H9N2
viruses circulating in chickens in southern China may have, at
intervals, been transmitted back to domestic ducks. It is note-
worthy that the HA1 of both H9N1 viruses joined the lineage,
represented by Dk/HK/Y439/97, similar to those of viruses

circulating in chickens in southern Korea since 1996 (Korea-
like lineage). None of the Qa/HK/G1/97-like HA was detected
among these H9 viruses tested.
Phylogenetic analysis of the N2 gene shows that all of the N2
genes from these duck H9N2 viruses tested, like their HA
genes, join and are closely related to the Dk/HK/Y280/97 lin-
eage. These findings further confirm their terrestrial origins.
Also, none of the Qa/HK/G1/97-like N2 was detected (data not
shown). However, phylogenetic analysis revealed that the N1
genes of two H9N1 viruses of ducks from Shantou, together
with Aq/HK/M603/98, clustered into the Gs/Gd/96 virus lin-
eage that differentiates from the HK/97-like lineage (Table 1).
Phylogenetic analyses of the six internal genes revealed that
many were of aquatic avian origin. The NP genes of H9N2
viruses form four groups, all of aquatic avian origin (Fig. 1b).
It was noted that the NP genes of two H9N2 viruses from ducks
in Shantou (Dk/ST/1605/01 and Dk/ST/2102/00) share the
same clade with Ck/HK/715.5/01 (H5N1, genotype E). The
polymerase genes (PB2, PB1, and PA) are mainly of aquatic
avian origin. Of these polymerase genes, four PB2, four PB1,
and two PA genes are closely related to the H9N2 viruses of
the Qa/HK/G1/97-like lineage (Fig. 1c and 2a and b; Table 1).
Like the NP gene tree, the PB2 genes of eight H9N2 duck virus
strains from Shantou also joined the same clade with the PB2
of those novel H5N1 viruses associated with the outbreak in
poultry markets of Hong Kong in 2001 (Fig. 1c). It is also noted
that the PB1 gene of Dk/ST/1605/01 and the PA gene of WDk/
ST/4808/01 are also closely related to those of H5N1/01 viruses
(Fig. 2a and b).
Phylogenetic analysis shows that the NS gene of most of the
H9 influenza virus isolated in the gene pool in 2000-2001 is
located in the Ck/Bei/1/94 virus lineage (A allele), while two
H9N1 (Dk/ST/1588/00 and Dk/ST/2030/00) and one H9N2
(Dk/ST/1605/01) virus lineages belong to the B allele. It is
interesting that the NS genes of the H9N1 viruses show the
same evolutionary pathway as the Gs/Gd/1/96 virus lineage
(Fig. 2c), suggesting that Gs/Gd/1/96-like viruses may be di-
rectly derived from the aquatic gene pool in southern China. In

contrast to the NS gene tree, the M genes of four H9N2 viruses
are closely related to the Qa/HK/G1/97 lineage, while eight
viruses are closely related to the Dk/HK/Y280/97 lineage (Ta-
ble 1). Only the two H9N1 viruses are incorporated into other
aquatic avian influenza virus lineages (Table 1).
Taken together, the phylogenetic analyses of all eight gene
segments of these H9 influenza viruses isolated from ducks in
Shantou revealed that, except for two H9N1 viruses, all of the
H9N2 viruses are double or even triple reassortants (Table 1).
Among these H9N2 influenza viruses, all of their surface genes
(HA and NA) were derived from the Y280-like virus lineage,
but most of their RNP gene complexes are of aquatic avian
origin. Some of these genes are closely related to those of the
newly emerged H5N1/HK/01 viruses (e.g., NP). However, the
NS and M genes of these H9N2 duck viruses are mainly related
to either Y280-like or G1-like virus lineages (Table 1). Overall,
the available information indicates that the H9N2 influenza
viruses isolated from ducks in Shantou from 2000 to 2001 arose
through interspecies transmission from the terrestrial gene
pool in this region. After entering their aquatic hosts, these
viruses further reassorted with those influenza viruses origi-
nally residing there.
Alignment studies. The deduced amino acid sequences of
the duck H9 HA genes were aligned and compared with those
of representative H9 viruses. All H9 duck isolates, except for
two H9N1 and one wild-duck H9N2 (WDk/ST/4808) virus lin-
eages, had amino acid residue leucine (L) at position 226 (H3
numbering) and glycine (G) at position 228 at the receptor-
binding site (Table 2). Amino acid L at position 226 is found in
H9N2 viruses of the Dk/HK/Y280/97 and Ck/HK/G9/97 lin-
eages isolated in Hong Kong and their more recent descen-
dants isolated from chicken (15). However, the H9 subtype
viruses isolated from ducks in the 1970s as well as the earliest
viruses of the Dk/HK/Y280/97 lineage such as Ck/Bei/1/94 and
Ck/HK/739/94 have glutamine (Q) at position 226 (Table 2).
The two recent H9N1 viruses (Dk/ST/1588/00 and Dk/ST/2030/
00) also have Q at amino acid residue 226. It is also noted that
only those H9 viruses established in land-based poultry and the
recent H9N2 duck isolates from Shantou maintain the Arg-
Ser-Ser-Arg (R-S-S-R) motif at the connecting peptide of their
FIG. 2. Phylogenetic trees for the PB1 (a), PA (b), and NS (c) genes of influenza A viruses. Evolutionary analyses of nucleotide sequences of
PB1, PA, and NS genes were performed as described in the legend to Fig. 1. The sequence ranges were listed in Materials and Methods. The PB1
and PA trees were rooted to B/Lee/40 and B/Singapore/222/79, respectively. The NS gene tree was rooted to A/Equine/Prague/1/56 (H7N7). Virus
names and abbreviations can be found in the legend of Fig. 1.

HA. In contrast, the H9 virus isolates obtained from ducks in
the 1970s as well as recent duck H9N1 viruses have the X-S-
X-R motif (Table 2) (where X represents any amino acid other
than Arg, Ser, or Lys). Thus, the genetic and phylogenetic
analyses of the H9N2 influenza viruses isolated from domestic
ducks in southern China during 2000-2001 provide convincing
evidence that the H9N2 influenza virus lineages established
since the mid-1990s in chicken and quail (7, 8) have been
transmitted back to domestic ducks, thereby generating double
or triple reassortants with influenza viruses resident in ducks.
DISCUSSION
Aquatic birds are recognized as natural gene reservoirs of
influenza A viruses around the world (1, 18, 28). Interspecies
transmission usually happens from aquatic birds to terrestrial
birds or to mammals such as pigs, horses, and even humans.
These interspecies transmissions establish a very complex eco-
logical system in nature. Since most of these interspecies trans-
mission events were identified and associated with zoonotic
outbreaks in new hosts, influenza gene flow was usually con-
sidered to occur from aquatic birds to other animal species.
This idea inhibited our understanding of the whole influenza
ecology system and the emergence of new influenza viruses
with pandemic propensity.
Antigenic and genetic analyses of the H9N2 influenza vi-
ruses isolated from domestic ducks in southern China during
2000-2001 provide convincing evidence that the H9N2 influ-
enza virus lineages established since the mid-1990s in chicken
and quail (8) have been transmitted back to domestic ducks,
generating double or triple reassortants with influenza viruses
already resident in ducks. Rather than indicating a one-way
flow of H9N2 viruses and their genes from aquatic to terrestrial
poultry as previously recognized (7, 9), these findings indicated
reverse transmission back to duck, i.e., there is a two-way
transmission between terrestrial and aquatic birds (Fig. 3).
This resulted in the generation of multiple genotypes of H9N2
viruses containing internal genes of aquatic avian origin. Fur-

pandemic influenza virus. The concept of the classic gene pool and the interplay between aquatic birds and influenza viruses may be explained by
frequent interspecies transmission between terrestrial and aquatic poultry in the southern region of China.

ther interspecies transmission of these reassortants to other
hosts may subsequently occur. This parallels the reemergence
of H5N1 influenza viruses in Hong Kong in 2001 (5) and 2002
(authors’ unpublished data). The lessons learned from these
H5N1 incidents are that when an established virus lineage such
as the A/Goose/Guangdong/1/96-like virus is reintroduced into
the duck (6), it leads to the generation of multiple reassortants
with new aquatic gene segments (5). Novel reassortants are
biologically unstable (12) and may transmit further to other
hosts—in this case terrestrial poultry, lower mammals, and
possibly humans (see below). This may be one method by
which the next pandemic virus will emerge.
Phylogenetic analyses of the internal genes of the H9N2
virus showed that some of them are closely related to the
internal gene complex found in H5N1/01 viruses. This infor-
mation suggests that the precursors of H5N1/01 viruses are still
circulating in the gene pool in this region and are reassorting
promiscuously. This finding also provides an example of the
interaction between those established lineages in terrestrial or
semiaquatic poultry and the domestic duck. In the long term,
this kind of interaction will increase virus diversity in the eco-
system in southern China.
The findings of the present investigation suggest that these
H9N2 reassortant viruses may have pandemic potential since
they contain a receptor-binding profile (10, 15) that favors
infection of humans and that some (e.g., the Qa/HK/G1/97-like
lineage) have gene segments previously associated with human
disease (14, 17). As H9N2 influenza viruses are not highly
pathogenic for poultry, it makes them more, rather than less,
likely to be of pandemic relevance. In fact, viruses that are less
pathogenic for poultry have a greater opportunity to become
widespread since they do not raise concern and permit their
hosts to survive unhindered. Thus, they are free to continue to
reassort and are more likely to have the opportunity to find the
best gene constellation (19, 28) that permits infection of hu-
mans and facilitates further person-to-person transmission.
The connecting peptides of the HA of the 1968 H3N2 and 1957
H2N2 pandemic viruses indicate that they are unlikely to have
been highly pathogenic for poultry. Two-way transmissions
between different types of poultry in southern China increase
the opportunity to generate influenza viruses with pandemic
potential. Our findings demonstrate that such viruses may be
directly generated from ducks.
It was noteworthy that the NS genes of two H9N1 viruses are
closely related to the counterparts in the Gs/Gd/1/96 virus.
This fact suggests that Gs/Gd/1/96-like H5N1 influenza virus
might also be generated from ducks in this region. As more
sequence data have been accumulated, precursors of impor-
tant emerging influenza viruses can be identified. Southern
China is considered to be an influenza epicenter mainly be-
cause the region was the site of two previous pandemics (Asian
and Hong Kong influenza) (22). The current status of the
influenza ecosystem in this region makes it very likely that the
next pandemic virus will also be generated in this region (Fig.
3).
One remaining question is why the HA and NA genes of
Qa/HK/G1/97-like H9N2 viruses have not been recently de-
tected in ducks even though some of their internal gene seg-
ments were found incorporated into some Ck/Bei/1/94-like
duck viruses. One explanation is that the HA and NA genes of
the Qa/HK/G1/97-like virus are no longer adaptable to aquatic
birds since the viruses have become more adapted to terrestrial
poultry. Another possible reason is that we sampled ducks
from specific regions where Qa/HK/G1-like viruses were not
locally prevalent. It is believed that these gene segments were
acquired in terrestrial birds, since reassortment events are fre-
quently observed between two established H9N2 lineages in
quail isolates (authors’ unpublished data).
Virus gene movements in both directions between different
types of poultry seem to be not uncommon in this region in the
recent past. The species barriers between the birds have be-
come much more permeable than previously anticipated. In-
creasing the heterogeneity of influenza viruses in these hosts
results in an enlarged and dynamic influenza gene pool in
continuous flux rather than one that is limited to aquatic birds
and therefore in evolutionary stasis (Fig. 3). The diversity of
genotypes, gene constellations, and host receptor specificities
will provide these viruses and their progeny with multiple op-
tions of hosts (11, 12, 19, 20). Such a situation would conceiv-
ably increase the opportunity for the generation of a new
pandemic influenza virus.
