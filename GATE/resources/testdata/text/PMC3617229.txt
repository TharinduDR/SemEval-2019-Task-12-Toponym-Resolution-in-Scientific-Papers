Abstract
Background: Rabies continues to be a major public health problem in the Philippines, where 200–300 human cases were
reported annually between 2001 and 2011. Understanding the phylogeography of rabies viruses is important for
establishing a more effective and feasible control strategy.
Methods: We performed a molecular analysis of rabies viruses in the Philippines using rabied animal brain samples. The
samples were collected from 11 of 17 regions, which covered three island groups (Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao). Partial
nucleoprotein (N) gene sequencing was performed on 57 samples and complete glycoprotein (G) gene sequencing was
performed on 235 samples collected between 2004 and 2010.
Results: The Philippine strains of rabies viruses were included in a distinct phylogenetic cluster, previously named Asian 2b,
which appeared to have diverged from the Chinese strain named Asian 2a. The Philippine strains were further divided into
three major clades, which were found exclusively in different island groups: clades L, V, and M in Luzon, Visayas, and
Mindanao, respectively. Clade L was subdivided into nine subclades (L1–L9) and clade V was subdivided into two subclades
(V1 and V2). With a few exceptions, most strains in each subclade were distributed in specific geographic areas. There were
also four strains that were divided into two genogroups but were not classified into any of the three major clades, and all
four strains were found in the island group of Luzon.
Conclusion: We detected three major clades and two distinct genogroups of rabies viruses in the Philippines. Our data
suggest that viruses of each clade and subclade evolved independently in each area without frequent introduction into
other areas. An important implication of these data is that geographically targeted dog vaccination using the island group
approach may effectively control rabies in the Philippines.

Introduction
Rabies is a fatal viral disease that causes an estimated 55,000
human deaths globally ever year, of which 57% occur in Asia [1].
Although effective measures to control rabies, such as dog
vaccination, are available, rabies still is a major public health
problem in many countries such as the Philippines, where 200–
300 human rabies cases were reported annually by the National
Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System between 2001 and 2011
[2]. Human rabies cases were also exported from the Philippines
to countries that had been declared rabies-free, including Japan in
2006 [3,4] and Finland in 2007 [5]. The National Rabies Control
and Prevention Program of the Philippines is a joint effort by the
Department of Agriculture, Department of Health, and other
partners that aim to eliminate rabies from the country by the year
2020 [2]. Hence, there is an urgent need to establish an effective
and feasible strategy for controlling rabies in the Philippines.
The rabies virus of the Rhabdoviridae family is the major
Lyssavirus responsible for majority of human and animal rabies
cases. The rabies viral genome is a nonsegmented single-stranded
negative-sense RNA of approximately 12 kb, which encodes a
nucleoprotein (N), a phosphoprotein (P), a matrix protein (M), a
glycoprotein (G), and a polymerase (L) [6,7]. The rabies virus N
gene is most commonly used for diagnosis with the reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) because it is
the most conserved gene in lyssaviruses [8]. The N gene has also
been used extensively in molecular epidemiological studies [7,9–
16] and the G gene encodes a surface protein that is targeted by

neutralizing antibodies. In addition, this surface protein is crucial
to viral invasion of host cells because it attaches to the host
receptors [17]. Many recent studies have utilized the rabies G gene
for molecular epidemiological analyses [10,14–16,18,19].
Phylogenetic analysis of the partial N gene was reported
previously for rabies viruses in the Philippines and indicated that
these viruses formed a unique phylogenetic group that was further
divided into two subgroups [9]. However, only a limited number
of specimens were analyzed. Therefore, more detailed genetic
information is needed to characterize circulating rabies viruses and
to further resolve their transmission dynamics in the Philippines.
Understanding the transmission dynamics and genetic diversity of
rabies provides useful information for establishing a rabies control
strategy [13,20]. The National Rabies Prevention and Control
Program (NRPCP) of the Philippines is implementing a geograph-
ically targeted dog vaccination approach to eliminate rabies. As
the Philippines is an island nation, this approach should be feasible
and effective for eliminating rabies provided transmissions
between islands are not frequent. Detailed molecular analyses of
rabies viruses from different regions elucidates geographic
compartmentalization, evolution, and transmission dynamics,
which can be used to establish an effective rabies control strategy
in the Philippines.
In the present study, we analyzed the complete G gene (1572 nt)
of rabies-positive animal brain samples collected from different
regions in the Philippines. We also performed partial N gene
sequencing (1124 nt) of the selected samples to compare the results
with those of complete G gene sequencing.
Materials and Methods
The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board
of the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM), which
requires a review of all research projects conducted at the RITM.
Sample Collection
Tissues from the hippocampus and medulla were collected from
suspected rabid animals from different regions of the Philippines
between 2004 and 2010. These included samples retrieved from
the sample bank of the National Rabies Reference Laboratory at
the RITM, which were collected from 2004 to 2007. The
remaining samples were collected prospectively from 2008 to 2010
from the Regional Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratories
(RADDLs) of Regions 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 10, the Cordillera
Autonomous Region (CAR) of the Department of Agriculture, and
the Provincial Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (PADDL) of
Dumaguete City, Negros Oriental. The Philippines is an island
nation comprising over 7,000 islands that are divided into three
groups, Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The country is governed
as 17 regions and 80 provinces. Samples were collected from 11
regions, including Regions 1, 2, 3, 4A, 4B, 5, CAR, the National
Capital Region (NCR) in Luzon, Region 7 in Visayas, and
Regions 10 and 11 in Mindanao (Figure S1). A fluorescent
antibody test (FAT) was performed at the RADDLs and PADDL
to diagnose rabies infection, and positive samples were shipped to
RITM for molecular analysis in accordance with the guidelines for
shipping Category B infectious substances [21].
FAT
FATs were repeated at the RITM to confirm positive results. In
brief, brain impression smears of the samples were fixed in cold
acetone and then air-dried. Each smear was flooded with
fluorescent isothiocyanate antirabies monoclonal globulin (Fujir-
ebio Diagnostics, Inc., Malvern, PA, USA) in 1% Evan’s blue
counterstain and were incubated in a humid chamber at 37uC for
30 min. The slides were washed twice with phosphate-buffered
saline, rinsed with double-distilled water (ddH2O), and air-dried.
Buffered glycerol mounting medium was applied before viewing
rabies virus antigens under an immunofluorescent microscope.
PCR
Total RNA was extracted from animal brain tissues using a
RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Approximately
30 mg of tissue was homogenized using a homogenization pestle,
and RNA was purified according to the manufacturer’s protocol
for animal tissues. RNA was eluted in 50 mL of diethylpyrocarbo-
nate-treated water and stored at 270uC until further processing.
The rabies virus G gene was amplified using primers RV-7F and
RV-9RPh to generate a 2,425-bp amplicon (Table 1). Primers p1
and 304 were used to amplify the rabies virus N gene, thereby
generating a 1,511-bp amplicon (Table 1).
Amplification was performed using Superscript III One-Step
RT-PCR with Platinum Taq High Fidelity Polymerase (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA). The 25 mL RT-PCR reaction mixture
contained 9 mL of ddH2O, 12.5 mL of 26reaction mix, 0.25 mL of
each primer at 50 mM, 0.5 mL of the enzyme mix, and 2.5 mL of
RNA template. One step RT-PCR was performed using a
TaKaRa PCR Thermal Cycler Dice (TaKaRa Bio Inc., Shiga,
Japan) under the following thermocycling conditions for the G
gene: reverse transcription at 50uC for 30 min, denaturation at
95uC for 5 min, 25 cycles of 94uC for 1 min, 65uC for 1 min, and
68uC for 1.5 min, and a final extension at 68uC for 10 min. The
following thermocycling conditions were used for the N gene:
reverse transcription at 50uC for 30 min, denaturation at 95uC for
5 min, 25 cycles of 94uC for 1 min, 54uC for 1 min, and 68uC for
1.5 min, and a final extension at 68uC for 10 min.
Nucleotide Sequencing
A SUPREC PCR Purification Kit (TaKaRa Bio Inc.) or a
QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) was used to purify RT-
PCR products prior to nucleotide sequencing. Cycle sequencing
was performed using a BigDye Terminator v1.1 or v3.1 Cycle
Author Summary
Rabies continues to be a major public health problem in
the Philippines. We conducted a molecular epidemiolog-
ical study of rabies using the complete glycoprotein (G)
gene from 235 animal brain samples collected in the
Philippines between 2004 and 2010. We identified three
major clades and two distinct genogroups in the
Philippines. The three major clades L, V, and M were
found specifically in the Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao
island groups, respectively. Additionally, two minor gen-
ogroups were located in the Luzon island group. These
data suggest that although human mediated transmission
may have occurred, these virus clades evolved indepen-
dently after a single introduction into each island group.
All of the analyzed Philippine strains were clustered into
Asian 2b, which diverged from the Chinese strain Asian 2a.
No recent introduction of rabies into the Philippines from
other countries was apparent. The elimination of rabies by
2020 is a national goal in the Philippines, necessitating
urgent development of a more effective and feasible
strategy for controlling rabies. Our findings indicate that a
geographically targeted dog vaccination campaign may
effectively control rabies in island nations such as the
Philippines.

Sequencing Kit (Applied BioSystems, Foster City, CA, USA) in the
TaKaRa PCR Thermal Cycler Dice. Sequencing reactions were
purified using a BigDye XTerminator Purification Kit (Applied
BioSystems) followed by loading into Genetic DNA Analyzers 310,
3130, or 3730xl (Applied BioSystems). Bidirectional sequencing was
performed using primers listed in Table 1 to resolve the complete G
gene (1,572 nt) and a partial region (1,124 nt) of the N gene.
Sequence Alignment and Genetic Analysis
Multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic relationships were
inferred using the maximum-likelihood method of the Molecular
Evolutionary Genetics Analysis version 5 algorithm (MEGA5;
http://www.megasoftware.net/) with bootstrap probability calculat-
ed from 500 replicates. In this analysis, the general time reversible+c
model was selected as a substitution model based on AICc values
(Akaike Information Criterion, corrected) using the model selection
feature of the MEGA5 program. The cut-off value for the condensed
tree was set at 80% and was used to define genogroups. Clades and
subclades were defined when the genogroup comprised more than 4
strains. Genogroups consisting of fewer than 3 strains were not
considered as clades and are indicated by the prefix ‘‘Gr.’’ All
reference sequences used for comparative analyses were obtained
from the GenBank genetic sequence database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/genbank/; Table 2). Sequences described in this study were
submitted to GenBank and corresponding accession numbers are
listed in Figure S1.
Results
Analyzed Samples
Of 317 brain tissue samples collected, 51 were excluded because
of incomplete epidemiological information (5 samples), failure of
PCR amplification (21 samples), or sequencing (25 samples). The
complete G gene (1572 nt) and parital G gene sequences were
determined for 233 and 33 strains, respectively.
A phylogenetic tree of partial G genes (698 nt) from 266 strains
was obtained (Figure S2), and because of low bootstrap values,
only samples with complete G genes were included in the analysis.
However, as a minor but unique branch was found in the
phylogenetic tree of partial G genes (698 nt), two samples collected
from Batangas and Mindoro Island were included despite
incomplete sequences (1549 nt; Figure S2). Therefore a total of
235 samples were analyzed (Figure 1).
Of the 235 samples, 35 were collected from 2004 to 2007 and
deposited in the sample bank, while 200 were collected
prospectively from 2008 to 2010. Among analyzed samples, 228
were collected from dogs, two from cats, one from a cow, and four
from unknown host species (Tables 3 and S1).
Phylogenetic Analysis
From 235 samples analyzed, phylogenetic trees were construct-
ed using 57 strains of N (1124 nt) and G (1572 nt) genes with the
maximum-likelihood method. To determine phylogenetic rela-
tionships, phylogenetic trees for the N and G genes were
constructed to compare the Philippine strains with those from
other Asian countries (Figure 2A and 2B). All the Philippine strains
were classified into one distinct cluster, which was divergent from
those of other Asian countries. This cluster included only the
Philippine strains and was previously named Asian 2b by Gong et
al. [22]. In the phylogenetic tree, the cluster closest to the
Philippine strains was Asian 2a, which comprised strains from
China, as shown in previous studies [16,22,23]. The Philippine
cluster was further divided into three major clades, namely L
(Luzon), V (Visayas), and M (Mindanao). However, two strains
from southern Luzon and Mindoro Island, namely GrSL and
GrMD, respectively, were not classified into any of the 3 major
clades in either N or G phylogenetic trees (Figure 2A and 2B).
To investigate phylogenetic relationships between the Philippine
strains in detail, we analyzed the full-length G gene sequence from
235 strains and the partial G gene (1549 nt) from two strains. It
was confirmed that there were three major clades and two distinct
genogroups. Clade L and two genogroups were found in the island
group of Luzon, whereas clades V and M were found in the
specific geographic island groups Visayas and Mindanao, respec-
tively. Interestingly, strains of the distinct genogroups GrSL and
GrMD were found in Mindoro Island and none of the clade L
strains were found on this island (Figure 1).
Clade L was further divided into nine subclades, L1–L9, and
there were three distinct genogroups with less than four strains,
which were named GrL1–GrL3 (Figure 3). L1 and GrL1 were
found in the Pangasinan Province of the western part of central
Luzon where L6 strains were also common, whereas L2 was found
mainly in the eastern part of central Luzon (Figure 3) and L3 was
also mainly distributed in central Luzon. GrL2 consisted of only
one strain that was found in Pampanga Province, and GrL3
consisted of two strains that were distributed in the provinces of

Rizal and Cavite located around Laguna de Bay (Figure 3). L4,
L5, and L7 were found in southwestern Luzon (Region 5) with the
exception of one strain each from L4 and L5, which were located
in NCR (Figure 3). L8 was further divided into L8a and L8b
(Figure 4). L8a and L8b strains were found in the northeastern and
northwestern parts of Luzon Island, respectively. L9 was divided
into 4 subclades, L9a–L9d, and 2 genogroups, GrL9a–GrL9b
(Figure 5). L9a, L9c, GrL9a, and GrL9b were found in central
Luzon, especially in Pampanga Province, and L9b was found
exclusively in Zambales Province. L9d was distributed in NCR
and Region 4A, with the exception of two strains located in the
provinces of Nueva Ecija and Pangasinan.
Clade V (Visayas) was subdivided into the two subclades V1 and V2.
All V1 strains were found exclusively on Cebu Island, whereas V2
strains were found exclusively on Negros Island (Figure 6). Clade M
(Mindanao) strains consisted of only one subclade (M1) and one
genogroup (GrM1), and all samples except 1 was from northern
Mindanao. The single sample from Davao (GrM1; southern Mind-
anao) was distinct from all other strains from this island (Figure 6).
Discussion
The N and G genes of rabies field strains obtained from 11 of 17
regions in the Philippines were analyzed. Our phylogenetic
analysis of the N and G genes revealed that there were three
major clades, namely L, V, and M (Figure 2). A previous study
identified two distinct clades in the Philippines [9]; however, it was
based on the analysis of only 59 strains and detailed geographic
information was not provided. In this study, we analyzed more
systematically collected strains from 11 different regions, including
Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao, and identified a previously
unknown clade, clade V, from Visayas. The presence of two
major clades from Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao indicated that
rabies viruses have evolved independently in these island groups
mainly because they are physically separated by sea. Similar
geographic compartmentalization of rabies viruses has been
reported in Indonesia, which is also an island nation [11].
Four strains were not classified into any of the three major
clades, including three in GrSL and another in GrMD (Figure 1).
Because only a few samples were found containing these
genogroups, evolutionary relationships with major clades could
not be defined. GrSL was found both in Luzon and Mindoro
Islands, which indicates that viral transmission occurred between
these islands. A similar pattern was observed in L7, which was
found in Sorsogon in Luzon Island and Catanduanes Island. This
suggests that even in areas separated by the sea, such as a narrow
channel with frequent ferry traffic, complete geographic barriers
for rabies transmission may not be established and that inter-island

transmission is possible in some exceptional cases. It is possible
that GrSL and GrMD formed distinct major clades, though this
remains to be confirmed with analyses of more strains in these
genogroups. There was also unique genogroup in clade L, i.e.
GrL3 was diverted separately from other subclades in clade L with
a bootstrap value of 42% (data not shown). Interestingly, all the
strains in these genogroups (GrMD, GrSL, and GrL3) were found
in southern Luzon and its neighboring island Mindoro. More
samples from these areas should be analyzed to better define
evolutionary relationships.
A recent molecular evolutionary analysis indicated that rabies
viruses in the Philippines (Asian 2b) diverged from viruses in China
approximately 1813 (from 1707 to 1821) [22]. Another molecular
evolutionary analysis based on N gene sequences suggested that
the time of their divergence may have ranged from 1825 to 1936
[23]. It has been indicated that rabies viruses were introduced into

previously rabies-free regions by human-mediated animal move-
ments [24]. The introduction of rabies viruses into the Philippines
was also possibly associated with human migration from China to
the Philippines. Further molecular evolutionary analyses of rabies
viruses in the Philippines are required to determine precise
evolutionary histories.
In general, subclades of clade L were represented by viruses
found in geographically distinct areas. Interestingly, L8a and L8b
were clearly divided by a mountainous area (Mountain Province
and Ifugao Province; Figure 4), indicating that the mountain range
also had an important impact on rabies virus transmission. L9 was
divided into four clades and two genogroups, indicating circulation
within a small geographic area (Figure 5). In clade L9, only L9d
was found in NCR and Region 4A from 2004 to 2007, whereas
other genogroups were found in Region 3 during 2008 and 2009
(Figure S3). Thus, a possibility that subclustering is determined not
only by geographical elements but also temporal elements cannot
be ruled out and samples collected from NCR after 2008 are
required to decipher these effects. The provinces of Pampanga and
Nueva Ecija contained five subclades and branches each, and the
Pangasinan Provinces and NCR contained four branches each
(Figures 3 and 5). Careful monitoring of the circulating strains
between these areas, in which multiple subclades were found may
provide important information regarding temporal and geograph-
ic transmission patterns of viruses in the Philippines.
In Region 5 of Luzon, the three subclades L4, L5, and L7
(Figure 3) were present. All L4 and L5 strains were found in
Region 5, with the exception of one strain of each found in NCR
(Figure 3). These long distance disseminations of viruses may have
occurred through human-mediated dog movements [11]. How-
ever, it is unclear with the current data whether these originated in
NCR or Region 5. Similarly, all of the L6 strains were distributed
in Regions 3 and 5, with the exception of one strain found over the
mountain range in the CAR.
In Visayas, viruses from different subclades V1 and V2 exist on
the Cebu and Negros islands, respectively (Figure 6). Although
these are separated by a narrow strait, our molecular analysis
indicated that there was no viral movement between the two
islands. All of the samples from Mindanao Island, with the
exception of a sample from Davao, were collected from the
northern region, particularly around the city of Cagayan de Oro
(Figure 6). More samples from other areas are required to

clades, Luzon (green line), Visayas (blue line), and Mindanao (orange line), and the two distinct strains from Mindoro and South Luzon. The red circle
shows the Philippine strain (RV/04030PHI/2004) [16,19] from the cluster that was previously named Asian 2b by Gong et al [19].

elucidate subclades from Mindanao Island. Like other islands,
Mindanao may have been the site of a unique viral evolution.
The Philippines has a national goal of eliminating rabies by the
year 2020, and a campaign of dog vaccinations has been
conducted by each local government. However, the program has
not been systematically implemented and funding allocation
depends on the priorities of each local government. Hence, there
is an urgent need to develop a more effective and feasible strategy
to control rabies. Being an island nation, the Philippines has an
advantage as rabies has been successfully eliminated in other
island nations such as the UK and Japan [25,26]. Our molecular
analyses showed that most rabies virus strains in the Philippines
are uniquely clustered, suggesting that introduction from other
countries has not occurred recently.
Understanding the transmission dynamics of the rabies viruses is
necessary for the development of an effective and feasible
elimination strategy, particularly in countries with limited
resources. Because of financial and resource constraints, the
NRPCP of the Philippines adopted a phasing approach to
eliminate rabies by area rather than nation-wide implementation
of extensive dog vaccinations. The effectiveness of this strategy
relies on limited transmissions between areas. Our molecular
analyses indicated that this strategy could be effective in
controlling rabies in the Philippines because there was clear
geographic clustering of clades and subclades. However, a
synchronized campaign would be necessary if there is frequent
inter-island traffic. The Republic Act No. 9482, known as the
Anti-Rabies Act of 2007, was enacted to control and eliminate
human and animal rabies. This mandated control over dog and
cat movements during inter-island transport and involved valid
vaccination certifications only allowing transport two weeks or
more after vaccination or within 12 months of vaccination by a
licensed veterinarian [27]. This policy must be strictly implement-
ed to avoid inter-island virus transmission via animal transporta-
tion as observed for the GrSL strain between Luzon and Mindoro
Islands and the L7 strain between Luzon and Catanduanes
Islands.
In some areas of Thailand, homogeneous viruses circulated
without recent introductions, which can serve as initial control
targets [13]. However, the introduction of new genotypes to other
locations is likely because of human-mediated dog movements
[13]. We found several instances where viral dispersal may have
occurred with dog movements. However, the frequency of such
dispersal appeared to be much lower than that in Thailand. A
more detailed analysis of dog movements, particularly on Luzon
Island, which is the largest island in the Philippines, should be
conducted to evaluate the risk of geographic dispersal.
There were several limitations to our study. Firstly, we analyzed
strains from wide geographic areas, including 11 of the 17 regions
of the Philippines; however, many areas remain unexamined. The
number of samples analyzed per region also varied because some
regional laboratories tested samples more actively than others.
Further, more samples were tested in areas close to the regional
laboratory. Therefore, samples from more remote areas were not
included in the analysis. Lastly, due to the limited time interval of
sample collection, we only analyzed geographic clustering of rabies

virus in the Philippines and temporal analysis, including molecular
evolutional analyses were not conducted in this study. Further
studies are required to fully understand these viral evolutionary
processes. Despite these limitations, our analysis provides valuable
molecular phylogeny and spatial distribution data for rabies virus
variants currently circulating in the Philippines.
