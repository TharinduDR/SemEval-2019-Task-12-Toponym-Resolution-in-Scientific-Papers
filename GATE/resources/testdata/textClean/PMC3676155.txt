In this prospective cohort study, based on 1,505 mother-infant pairs in rural Bangladesh, we evaluated the
associations between early-life exposure to arsenic, cadmium, and lead, assessed via concentrations in maternal
and child urine, and children’s weights and heights up to age 5 years, during the period 2001–2009. Concurrent
and prenatal exposures were evaluated using linear regression analysis, while longitudinal exposure was
assessed using mixed-effects linear regression. An inverse association was found between children’s weight and
height, age-adjusted z scores, and growth velocity at age 5 years and concurrent exposure to cadmium and
arsenic. In the longitudinal analysis, multivariable-adjusted attributable differences in children’s weight at age 5
years were −0.33 kg (95% confidence interval (CI): −0.60, −0.06) for high (≥95th percentile) arsenic exposure
and −0.57 kg (95% CI: −0.88, −0.26) for high cadmium exposure, in comparison with children with the lowest
exposure (≤5th percentile). Multivariable-adjusted attributable differences in height were −0.50 cm (95% CI:
−1.20, 0.21) for high arsenic exposure and −1.6 cm (95% CI: −2.4, −0.77) for high cadmium exposure. The associations were apparent primarily among girls. The negative effects on children’s growth at age 5 years attributable
to arsenic and cadmium were of similar magnitude to the difference between girls and boys in terms of weight
(−0.67 kg, 95% CI: −0.82, −0.53) and height (−1.3 cm, 95% CI: −1.7, −0.89).

Growth restriction in early life is associated with a number
of poor health outcomes later in life. In particular, stunting,
or height-for-age z score more than 2 standard deviations
below the median reference set by the World Health Organization, has been associated with later behavioral problems,
cognitive deﬁcits, and increased risk of hypertension and
cardiovascular disease (1–5). Underweight, or weight-forage z score more than 2 standard deviations below the World
Health Organization median, is associated with increased
risk of death from diseases such as pneumonia, diarrhea, and
malaria (6).
The primary risk factor for growth restriction in children
is malnutrition. The most important risk factors for stunting

and underweight occur during early life, including maternal
undernutrition during pregnancy, inadequate breastfeeding,
and inappropriate introduction of complementary foods (7).
However, other early-life environmental exposures may also
play a role in growth restriction (7).
Childhood lead exposure has been associated with stunting in children (8, 9), and studies in animals demonstrate
that lead affects growth via toxic effects on bone tissue (10).
Both arsenic exposure and cadmium exposure are inversely
associated with infant size at birth, and this relationship may
vary between boys and girls (11, 12), though less is known
about how arsenic and cadmium exposure affect subsequent
growth. An inverse association between arsenic exposure

1356

Early-Life Metals Exposure and Children’s Growth 1357

and children’s height and weight has been reported in relatively small, cross-sectional studies (13–15). However, in a
much larger longitudinal study, we found only a weak
inverse association between prenatal arsenic exposure and
children’s growth to age 2 years that was greatly attenuated
by adjustment for other risk factors (16). Several small
studies have shown that prenatal cadmium exposure was
associated with attenuated weight and height in preschool
children, though concurrent exposures were not accounted
for (17, 18). To our knowledge, no studies to date have considered the independent associations of these toxic metals
over time with anthropometric outcomes within the same
population.
In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the relationship
between both prenatal and concurrent environmental exposure and children’s attained weight and height at 5 years, as
well as growth velocities from birth to age 5 years and standardized z scores, using a longitudinal study design within a
well-characterized mother-child cohort in rural Bangladesh.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study area and population

The present study is part of our ongoing research concerning health effects of early-life exposure to toxic agents in
Matlab, Bangladesh, a rural area 53 km southeast of Dhaka.
This research is nested into a population-based randomized
trial of food and micronutrient supplementation, Maternal
and Infant Nutrition Interventions in Matlab (MINIMat) (19).
Mothers of children born between May 2002 and December
2003 (n = 2,853) were invited to participate in the assessment of environmental contaminants and child health and
development (20). Of these mother-child pairs, those who
had complete anthropometric data at birth and at ages 1.5
and 5 years, as well as environmental exposure data prenatally and at ages 1.5 and 5 years, were included in this study
(n = 1,505; Figure 1). Pairs who were included in the study
were similar to excluded pairs in terms of exposures, outcomes, and other demographic characteristics (see Web
Table 1, available at http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/).
This study was approved by the Regional Ethical Committee at Karolinska Institutet (Stockholm, Sweden) and the
Ethical Review Committee at the International Center for
Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (Dhaka, Bangladesh). Informed consent was obtained from the mothers, and
all participants were free to refrain from any part of the study.
Anthropometric measurements

Children’s weights and lengths/heights were measured at
birth, monthly during the ﬁrst year of life, once every 3
months during the second year of life, and again at a 5-year
follow-up visit, according to methods previously described
in detail (21, 22). Missing measurements were more
common during the ﬁrst year, because study capacity was
still being developed during the ﬁrst months of the
MINIMat follow-up; 41% of measurements were missing at
month 1, 20% were missing at month 6, and 5% were
missing at month 12.

Socioeconomic status

Data on an extensive list of socioeconomic status (SES)
factors at the time of enrollment were extracted from the
health and demographic database maintained by the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh.
SES was deﬁned in terms of assets (on the basis of household ownership of different items), dwelling characteristics,
drinking-water source, and household sanitation. Asset
scores were standardized as previously described (23, 24).
Exposure assessment

Exposure assessment was based on urinary concentrations
of arsenic, cadmium, and lead in spot urine samples collected from pregnant women and their children at ages 1.5
and 5 years (25–27). Urinary arsenic, deﬁned as the total
concentration of the metabolites of inorganic arsenic (inorganic
arsenic + monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) + dimethylarsinic
acid (DMA)), was determined by high-performance liquid
chromatography (Agilent 1100 Series system; Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) coupled with hydride generation and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry
(Agilent 7500ce; Agilent Technologies) for all children at
both 1.5 and 5 years of age (25, 27, 28) and by hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometry for maternal samples
(26). Measurement of cadmium (mass-to-charge ratio, 111)
and lead (mass-to-charge ratio, 208) was also performed
with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry for
maternal samples and children’s samples at age 5 years (29,
30). The between-assay coefﬁcient of variation was 2.0%
for maternal total urinary arsenic (26) and 6.8% and 5.8%
for DMA in children’s samples at ages 1.5 years (27) and 5
years (25), respectively. For urinary cadmium, the coefﬁcient

for children’s samples at age 5 years (30). For urinary lead,
the coefﬁcient of variation was 11% for maternal samples

and 7.3% for children’s samples at age 5 years (29). (See

measurements.)

To compensate for variation in dilution of the urine samples, we adjusted all measurements for the speciﬁc gravity
of the urine, measured by means of a digital clinical refractometer (EUROMEX RD 712; EUROMEX, Arnhem,
the Netherlands) (31). Adjustment by urinary creatinine is
problematic in growth studies, particularly those involving
arsenic, because urinary creatinine is associated with body
size, is inﬂuenced by nutritional factors that can also inﬂuence arsenic metabolism and growth, and is itself correlated
with arsenic metabolism efﬁciency (31, 32).
Statistical analysis

All statistical analyses were conducted using STATA,
version 10 (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas).
We considered attained weight, height, weight-for-age z
score, height-for-age z score, peak weight velocity, and peak
height velocity as outcomes. Weight-for-age z score and
height-for-age z score were calculated according to standard
Am J Epidemiol. 2013;177(12):1356–1367

World Health Organization methods (33). Peak weight velocity and peak height velocity were calculated using all available
data from birth to the 5-year visit. The 4-parameter Reed
model (34) for children’s growth, modiﬁed according to the
methods described by                 (35), was ﬁtted by sex
using maximum likelihood estimation and assuming both
ﬁxed and random components for all parameters. The ﬁrst
derivatives of the individual ﬁtted growth curves were taken to
calculate the maximum weight or height velocity for each
child (36).
Given the potential for a nonlinear association between
the exposure biomarkers and the outcomes (Figure 2), we
tested the crude association between the tertiles of each biomarker and the anthropometric outcomes. We repeated this
analysis, adjusting for the following possible confounders:
family SES, maternal tobacco-chewing during pregnancy,
cooking over ﬁre indoors, maternal educational level (≥5
years or <5 years (the median value)), season of birth ( pre–
rainy season, rainy season, or post–rainy season), and parity.

Possible confounders were deﬁned as being associated with
any exposure (Table 1) as well as being associated with
children’s anthropometric outcomes at age 5 years. Additionally, we included other predictors of the outcomes:
child’s sex, maternal anthropometric characteristics, and
gestational age at birth. The effect of food and micronutrient
supplementation on childhood growth has been reported for
the full MINIMat cohort elsewhere (22). We also assessed
whether adding the 2 different types of food (early and
usual) and/or 3 different types of micronutrient supplementation used in the MINIMat supplementation trial (22, 37) to
the models changed the associations between environmental
exposures and anthropometric outcomes. Because inclusion
of these covariates did not change any of the associations
(using either this strategy or the modeling strategy outlined
below), we did not include these covariates in the ﬁnal
models presented here.
We also considered 4 models in which the biomarker concentration was log2-transformed to account for the nonlinear

relationship between biomarkers and anthropometric measures (Figure 2). In this analysis, each β coefﬁcient represents the average change in the outcome associated with
each doubling of the concentration of the biomarker. In
model 1, we examined the crude association between each
individual environmental exposure (measured as children’s
urinary arsenic, urinary cadmium, and urinary lead levels at
age 5 years) and each outcome at age 5 years. In model 2,
we repeated the analysis, adjusting for possible confounders
and predictors of outcome listed above. In model 3, to
control for any effects of prenatal environmental exposure,
we adjusted the results as in model 2, with the addition of
maternal urinary arsenic, urinary cadmium, or urinary lead
measured during gestational week 8. In model 4, we evaluated the associations of children’s urinary arsenic, urinary
cadmium, and urinary lead levels with anthropometric outcomes in the same model, also adjusted as in model 2. After
calculating the estimates for all models described here, we
used the STATA suest command for “seemingly unrelated

estimation,” which provides robust standard errors and
adjusts model estimates for intragroup correlation after conducting multiple tests on a set of correlated exposures and
outcomes (38). We present the adjusted model estimates. In
a subsequent analysis, we added the percentage of MMA,
the most toxic arsenic metabolite, into model 2 for the
arsenic-only models to test whether efﬁciency of arsenic
metabolism affected these relationships.
We next examined whether prenatal environmental exposures were related to the anthropometric outcomes at age
5 years. We followed the same modeling strategy as outlined
above, substituting maternal urinary biomarkers measured at
gestational week 8 for children’s urinary biomarkers in the
models.
To explore the longitudinal relationship between exposure
and children’s weight and height over time, we used mixedeffects linear regression models with a random intercept and

birth. To allow the effects of environmental exposures to
change over time, we included interaction terms for each biomarker and time. To allow for differences between boys and
girls and SES to change over time, we included terms for the
interaction between these variables and time. We adjusted the
results as in model 2 above.
Given evidence that metals may have sex-speciﬁc
effects (39), we stratiﬁed the data by sex and repeated the
above analysis, excluding any sex-related terms. Additionally, we lacked data on individual nutritional intake in this
study. In order to address the possibility that the observed
associations were due to unobserved confounding by nutritional status, we stratiﬁed the sample based on quintiles of
SES and compared the associations between environmental exposures and weight and height according to SES
quintile (highest quintile (rate of stunting at age 5 years:
16%) vs. lowest quintile (rate of stunting at age 5 years:
46%)).
We calculated the multivariable-adjusted difference
in weight and height due to environmental exposures by
comparing the multivariable-adjusted weight or height of
children with urinary arsenic at or above the 95th percentile

arsenic, urinary cadmium, and urinary lead levels were weakly
but positively correlated, and mothers’ and children’s urinary
arsenic and urinary cadmium levels were inversely associated

Population characteristics

On average, the children were 63 months of age (standard
deviation, 1.8 months) at the 5-year visit. At age 5 years,
41% of the children were underweight and 33% were
stunted. Table 2 shows in detail the participants’ anthropometric characteristics at age 5 years, according to environmental exposures and demographic information. Detailed
descriptions of the anthropometric measures for this cohort
at the time of birth (11, 12) and during the ﬁrst 2 years of
life (16) have been reported previously. Children’s early-life
exposures to arsenic, cadmium, and lead have been explored
in detail previously (25, 29, 30). (See Web Table 1 for a

In the tertile analysis (Figure 3), urinary arsenic was
inversely associated with both weight and height outcomes.
The inverse association was most apparent when comparing
the middle tertile with the lowest tertile; in all cases, the association was attenuated in the highest tertile after adjustment.
Urinary cadmium was consistently inversely associated with
both weight and height outcomes, though not all associations
remained statistically signiﬁcant after adjustment. Urinary lead
was not associated with any of the anthropometric outcomes.
In an analysis using log2-transformed data (Figure 4),
urinary arsenic was inversely associated with weight, height,

velocity at age 5 years, although these associations were no
longer apparent after adjustment. When the percentage of
MMA was included in model 2, we found that the percentage
of MMA was positively associated with the anthropometric
outcomes (Web Table 2). Urinary cadmium was consistently
inversely associated with all anthropometric outcomes. The
association was attenuated, though still statistically signiﬁcant,
after adjustment. The association strengthened slightly with the
addition of prenatal urinary cadmium to the model (model 3).
Urinary lead level was not associated with any of the anthropometric outcomes. In a model accounting for all 3 environmental exposures, urinary cadmium was the only biomarker
to remain associated with the anthropometric outcomes.
Are prenatal environmental exposures associated with
anthropometric outcomes in 5-year-olds?

Only maternal urinary cadmium level was inversely associated with the children’s anthropometric outcomes, although

this relationship disappeared after adjustment (Web Figure 1).
None of the maternal biomarkers were associated with the
anthropometric outcomes at age 5 years in a model accounting for exposure to all 3 metals or in models also accounting

Are lifelong environmental exposures related to

The multivariable-adjusted difference in attained weight
at age 5 years between highly exposed (≥95th percentile)
and less exposed (≤5th percentile) children was 0.33 kg for
arsenic and 0.57 kg for cadmium (Figure 5). The difference
in attained height at age 5 years attributable to high cadmium
exposure was 1.6 cm, while the difference in attained height
attributable to high arsenic exposure was 0.5 cm and not
statistically signiﬁcant (Figure 5). The differences in both
weight and height attributable to lead exposure were not statistically signiﬁcant. For comparison, multivariable-adjusted

years attributable to lifelong arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), and lead
(Pb) exposure, assessed in Matlab, Bangladesh, 2001–2009. The
relationship between combined exposure to arsenic, cadmium, and
lead over time and the child’s weight and length/height from birth to
age 5 years was assessed using mixed-effects linear regression and
was adjusted for child’s sex, family socioeconomic status (SES),
season of birth, gestational age at birth, maternal education, maternal
height or body mass index (weight (kg)/height (m)2) (as appropriate),
maternal tobacco-chewing, indoor cooking without ventilation, and
birth order. Multivariable-adjusted attributable differences were
calculated by comparing the model-predicted weight (A) or height (B)
of children with urinary arsenic, urinary cadmium, and urinary lead
levels at or above the 95th percentile at age 5 years with those of
children at or below the 5th percentile (shown as squares). The
analysis was repeated after stratification for sex and SES, and
multivariable-adjusted differences are also shown for boys

estimates showed that girls were on average 0.67 kg lighter
(95% conﬁdence interval (CI): −0.82, −0.53) and 1.3 cm
shorter (95% CI: −1.7, −0.89) than boys at age 5 years and
that children with the lowest SES were on average 1.03 kg
lighter (95% CI: −1.14, −0.76) and 2.8 cm shorter (95% CI:
−3.2, −2.4) than children with the highest SES.
After stratiﬁcation by sex, the differences in attained weight
and height at age 5 years attributable to high arsenic or high
cadmium were apparent only in the girls. After stratiﬁcation
by SES, the differences in attained weight and height attributable to high arsenic exposure were apparent only among those
with low SES, while the attributable change due to high
cadmium exposure was somewhat attenuated in the high-SES
group compared with the low-SES group.
DISCUSSION

In this study, we showed that, among the 3 metals tested,
early-life cadmium exposure had the strongest and most consistent inverse association with children’s growth in terms of
weight and (particularly) height. The inverse association

between cadmium and arsenic and children’s growth was
most apparent among the girls, and these inverse associations
persisted even after controlling for the other environmental
exposures and relevant factors for children’s growth in a longitudinal model. Consistent with our earlier observations of
children’s size at birth (11), the arsenic dose-effect relationship was nonlinear, with the largest changes occurring within
the lower arsenic exposure range and leveling off at higher
exposures. While previous cross-sectional studies have shown
inverse associations between both cadmium exposure and
arsenic exposure during various windows of development
and children’s height and weight, we showed that concurrent
exposures were more strongly correlated with children’s size
at age 5 years than were prenatal exposures. Surprisingly, children with a higher percentage of MMA, the most toxic
arsenic metabolite, had improved anthropometric outcomes.
This may indicate that children with the best growth trajectories lack methyl groups readily available for the complete
metabolism of arsenic to DMA, since methyl groups are also
necessary for building new tissue.
With regard to maternal exposures, cadmium levels of
this magnitude are somewhat elevated but not uncommon in
other countries (40, 41), particularly in persons who consume greater amounts of rice and vegetables (42). However,
the cadmium exposure levels observed among most children
in this population were above the median reported for US
(43) and German (44) children. The children’s rice-based
diet is most likely the main source of cadmium exposure
(30). Arsenic was markedly elevated in most children (25),
in comparison with values reported in German children (44).
Exposure to arsenic in this population is due to elevated concentrations of arsenic in tube-well water, as well as elevated
concentrations in rice irrigated with arsenic-contaminated
water (25). One limitation of this study was that we lacked
blood lead measurements for the children; therefore, direct
comparisons with exposures in other populations and with
the literature on the association between lead and stunting
were difﬁcult to make. If the children’s blood lead concentrations were similar to their mothers’ previously reported
values (median, 3.6 μg/dL; range, 1.4–11.5) (29) given their
similar urinary lead concentrations, they would be within
the range for which associations between lead and stunting
have been reported in studies of other populations (8, 45).
The mechanisms by which arsenic and cadmium may
affect growth in early life are unclear. The literature on
cadmium exposure and osteoporosis suggests that cadmium
may be directly toxic to bone in adults, leading to increased
risk of osteoporosis (46–48). One recent study showed evidence for increased bone resorption and demineralization in
10-year-old children with exposure to cadmium, suggesting
that cadmium may affect bone tissue from an early age (49).
Such toxic effects may translate to impaired bone growth in
children and, thus, to a reduction in attained height.
Cadmium and arsenic also interfere with the distribution
and function of micronutrients. Our studies in this cohort
have shown that maternal cadmium exposure was associated
with impaired transfer of zinc across the placenta and
decreased calcium levels in breast milk (50, 51). While disruption of the transfer of these nutrients in the pregnant and
nursing mother could lead to disrupted growth in children,

Early-Life Metals Exposure and Children’s Growth 1365

concurrent exposure was more strongly associated with negative outcomes in terms of weight and height than was prenatal
exposure. It is plausible that cadmium exposure may affect
calcium and zinc distribution and function in children as well.
Arsenic exposure is associated with increased risk of
anemia (52). Growth retardation is one potential consequence
of anemia in children, and improving iron and zinc status in
undernourished children aged 1–4 years improves growth trajectories (53). Both arsenic and cadmium were inversely
associated with family SES, a broad indicator of nutritional
status (54), and the associations of both markers with anthropometric outcomes were attenuated by the addition of SES
and other potential confounders to the model. However, we
observed that the inverse association between arsenic exposure and children’s growth was apparent only among children
of the highest SES, and that the inverse association between
cadmium exposure and children’s growth was mildly attenuated among children of the highest SES compared with children
of the lowest SES. This indicates that our results are not likely
to be due to unobserved confounding by nutritional status.
Additionally, cadmium and arsenic have endocrinedisrupting properties, which may disrupt growth in young
children, particularly in a sex-speciﬁc fashion. Evidence in
humans and experimental animals suggests that cadmium
disrupts steroidogenesis, particularly in the placenta, and
acts as an endocrine-disrupting chemical, capable of mimicking or inhibiting the functions of endogenous estradiol
(55). Cadmium exposure in adolescents living in Belgium
was associated with decreased height and body mass index, as
well as lower circulating levels of estradiol and testosterone in
the blood (56, 57). Additionally, in experimental animals,
high doses of cadmium have been found to lower plasma concentrations of insulin-like growth factor 1, a hormone critical
for childhood growth (58). Arsenic may affect insulin signaling and glucose metabolism (59, 60), eventually leading to
glucose intolerance and diabetes in exposed populations.
Early disruption of glucose uptake by tissues may plausibly
lead to impaired growth. This mechanism may be more pronounced in children with better overall nutrition, potentially
explaining our observations of arsenic’s effects after stratiﬁcation by SES.
In conclusion, this study has provided evidence that environmental exposures to cadmium and arsenic during early life
may contribute to poor growth. The longitudinal modeling
presented here showed that persistent exposure to cadmium
in early life led to a cadmium-attributable decrease in height
and weight by age 5 years that was of the same magnitude as
the differences observed between girls and boys at that age.
Arsenic-attributable differences in weight were smaller, though
still large enough to prompt concern.
