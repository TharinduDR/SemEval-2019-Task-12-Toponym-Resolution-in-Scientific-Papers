Abstract
Background: We examined whether the effect of maternal smoking during pregnancy on
birthweight of the offspring was mediated by smoking-induced changes to DNA methylation in cord blood.
Methods: First, we used cord blood of 129 Dutch children exposed to maternal smoking
vs 126 unexposed to maternal and paternal smoking (53% male) participating in the
GECKO Drenthe birth cohort. DNA methylation was measured using the Illumina
HumanMethylation450 Beadchip. We performed an epigenome-wide association study
for the association between maternal smoking and methylation followed by a mediation
analysis of the top signals [false-discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05]. We adjusted both analyses
for maternal age, education, pre-pregnancy BMI, offspring’s sex, gestational age and
white blood cell composition. Secondly, in 175 exposed and 1248 unexposed newborns
from two independent birth cohorts, we replicated and meta-analysed results of eight
cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites in the GFI1 gene, which showed the most robust
mediation. Finally, we performed functional network and enrichment analysis.
Results: We found 35 differentially methylated CpGs (FDR < 0.05) in newborns exposed vs
unexposed to smoking, of which 23 survived Bonferroni correction (P < 1  10-7). These 23
CpGs mapped to eight genes: AHRR, GFI1, MYO1G, CYP1A1, NEUROG1, CNTNAP2,
FRMD4A and LRP5. We observed partial confirmation as three of the eight CpGs in GFI1 replicated. These CpGs partly mediated the effect of maternal smoking on birthweight (Sobel

P < 0.05) in meta-analysis of GECKO and the two replication cohorts. Differential methylation
of these three GFI1 CpGs explained 12–19% of the 202 g lower birthweight in smoking mothers. Functional enrichment analysis pointed towards activation of cell-mediated immunity.
Conclusions: Maternal smoking during pregnancy was associated with cord blood
methylation differences. We observed a potentially mediating role of methylation in the
association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and birthweight of the offspring. Functional network analysis suggested a role in activating the immune system.

Key Messages
• Maternal smoking during pregnancy is associated with genome-wide cord blood methylation differences.
• Differential methylation may mediate part of the association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and birth-

weight of the offspring.
• Functional network and enrichment analysis suggest a role in activating the immune system.
• Future research should include the collaboration of multiple birth cohorts to meta-analyse the (potentially mediating)

role of differential methylation in early development.

Introduction
It is well known that maternal smoking during pregnancy
can cause intrauterine growth restriction and low birthweight.1–4 Low birthweight, in turn, has been associated
with increased childhood growth and cardiometabolic
problems in childhood and adulthood.5,6 The development
of chronic diseases in adulthood is therefore believed to start
during pregnancy as a result of exposure to adverse intrauterine environments, also known as fetal programming.
We hypothesized that the long-lasting effects of adverse fetal
exposures (e.g. smoking) on birthweight and subsequent
cardiometabolic risk are at least partly caused by DNA
methylation.7–9 Thus, maternal smoking during pregnancy
may have adverse health consequences during the offspring’s
entire life course via DNA methylation.
In recent studies, tobacco smoke exposure has been associated with DNA methylation changes in smokers.10–12 The
effect of maternal tobacco smoking during pregnancy on
DNA methylation of their offspring has also been
investigated in a number of studies using different designs.13–20 Several of these studies in offspring investigated
global or gene-specific DNA methylation differences, in umbilical cord blood and placental cells.13,14,16,21 Several studies have used an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS)
design,17–20 focusing on methylation differences of individual cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites. Some EWASs
used the 27 k chip (Illumina Inc., San Diego, USA) in placental samples or whole blood samples of children and identified methylation of several CpGs to be associated with

maternal smoking during pregnancy.19,20 Other EWASs
used the 450 K chip (Illumina Inc., San Diego, USA) to identify changes in methylation associated with maternal smoking during pregnancy.17,18               17 identified and
replicated methylation changes in cord blood of several
genes (AHRR, CYP1A1 and GFI1) associated with maternal smoking during pregnancy. More recently,         
      18 identified and replicated differential methylation of
CpGs in 10 novel genes in whole blood from 889 newborns.
Other EWASs studied associations with birthweight.22,23
             23 found no epigenome-wide associations with
birthweight, whereas             22 identified 19 CpGs.
Interestingly, no studies investigated mediation by methylation in the association between maternal smoking and birthweight or other health-related outcomes.
Therefore, we conducted an EWAS in cord blood to
examine the association between maternal smoking during
pregnancy and DNA methylation, with the 450 K chip.
Furthermore, we studied for the first time whether differentially methylated CpGs mediated the effect of smoking
on birthweight. Finally, we sought to replicate the most
promising mediation findings in two independent birth cohorts, and meta-analysed the results.

Methods
Subjects
We derived data from GECKO Drenthe, a Dutch population-based birth cohort that studies risk factors associated

1226

with the development of overweight from birth into adulthood.24 The cohort includes 2874 children born between
April 2006 and April 2007. Children have been extensively
phenotyped on parental characteristics, pregnancy and delivery, children’s health, nutrition and childhood growth.
Data were gathered during pregnancy and at multiple time
points during childhood. Maternal and paternal smoking
during pregnancy were self-reported and (if available)
additional information from obstetricians was used.
Directly after delivery, umbilical cord blood was collected
from 1565 children and stored at -80 C. DNA was extracted from the buffy coats using the QIAamp96 DNA
Blood Kit (QIAGEN). To increase DNA concentration
to  50 ng/ml, all samples were treated with Glycoblue.
From all children in the total cohort with stored
cord blood, we selected those that had sufficient DNA
of good quality after DNA isolation (DNA concentration  50 mg/ml). Of those, we excluded non-Dutch newborns, premature newborns (37 weeks), twins and those
with a mother with (gestational) diabetes. We also
excluded children with missing information on these variables, which resulted in n ¼ 1118. Then 447 children were
selected because they had information on maternal and
paternal smoking during pregnancy and the number of
cigarettes smoked by the mother. This resulted in 129
children exposed to maternal smoking and 318 children
unexposed to either maternal or paternal smoking. This
group of 447 did not differ from the group of 1118 on gestational age, birthweight, maternal educational level or
gender. Only the maternal pre-pregnancy BMI of the group
of 447 was slightly lower (24.4 vs 25.0 kg/m2). Therefore,
we concluded that these 447 were broadly representative
of the total cohort. We used the complete exposed group
(n ¼ 129) and randomly selected 129 unexposed newborns
(of which 3 dropped out during QC), see flowchart in
Supplementary Figure S1, available as Supplementary data
at IJE online.
This study has been approved by the Medical Ethics
Committee of the University Medical Center Groningen,
and parents of all participants gave written informed
consent.

Genome-wide methylation assay
We used 500 ng DNA per sample to perform methylation
analysis. To minimize batch effects, we randomized all
samples on sex and exposure status per chip over three
96-well plates. Thus each chip contained three exposed
boys, three unexposed boys, three exposed girls and three
unexposed girls. In addition, we randomly assigned five
control samples of the same male to each plate; two on the
first plate, two on the second plate and one on the third

International Journal of Epidemiology, 2015, Vol. 44, No. 4

plate. We performed bisulphite conversion using the
      DNA methylation kit (Zymo research Corporation,
Irvine, USA). After validating that unmethylated cytosines had converted to thymidines using commercially
available bisulphite conversion controls (Zymo Research
Corporation, Irvine, USA), we processed the samples using
the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (Illumina
Inc., San Diego, USA). We checked performance of built-in
internal quality controls in the Controls Dashboard in the
methylation module of GenomeStudio (Illumina Inc., San
Diego, USA).

Quality control
For all 485 577 CpGs we calculated beta-values and detection P-values using the Minfi R package.25 Overall, betavalues ranged from zero to one, showing the level of
methylation for each CpG, and detection P-values < 0.05
indicated that the target sequence signal was distinguishable from the background. We performed all quality control steps for the three plates separately. Cluster plots for
the betas on the X chromosome showed a clear distinction
by sex. Two males were in the female cluster, and were
excluded from further analyses. Illumina-suggested background normalization and colour correction were performed. One sample did not meet the criterion of  99%
of the CpGs with detection P-value < 0.05 and was
excluded. This resulted in a final sample of 255 children:
129 exposed and 126 unexposed. Control probes, probes
on X or Y chromosomes and probes that did not meet our
criteria of a detection P-value of < 0.05 in  99% of the
samples were excluded. This resulted in 465 891 remaining
CpGs. The five duplicate male control samples (included in
each plate) showed high correlations ranging from 0.995
to 0.998, indicating that batch effects were minimal. These
five samples were removed from further analyses.

Statistical analyses
We performed all pre-processing steps using R packages
SWAN (Subset-quantile Within Array Normalization) and
Minfi25 and linear regression in the R package Limma
(Linear Models for Microarray Analysis).26 We generated
basic characteristics, mediation analysis and the volcano
plot in Stata v12 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).

Epigenome-wide association (EWAS) analysis
We performed linear regression analyses in Limma comparing the methylation beta values of the exposed with the
unexposed group. We adjusted for the following covariates
that were selected based on their expected association with

International Journal of Epidemiology, 2015, Vol. 44, No. 4

maternal smoking and/or methylation: sex, gestational age,
maternal age, pre-pregnancy BMI, educational level, plate
number and cell type composition.17,18,27 Sex and gestational age (weeks) were reported by obstetricians.
Maternal educational level (low/average vs university
educated), maternal BMI before pregnancy (kg/m2) and
maternal age (years) were self-reported by the mothers.
Missing values on gestational age (n ¼ 2), maternal educational level (n ¼ 3) and maternal pre-pregnancy BMI
(n ¼ 8) were imputed with the mean/median to maintain
power. Excluding the 10 newborns with  1 missing covariate did not alter the results, and since multiple imputation
in an EWAS dataset would be computationally burdensome, we present our findings including these 10 samples
with single imputed covariate data. Furthermore, the number of participants with missing data was very small, thus
substantial bias was unlikely. Additionally, we included
plate number to adjust for potential batch effects and we
calculated cell type proportions based on the method previously presented by Houseman and colleagues28 with the
dataset presented by Reinius and colleagues.29 These cell
type proportions (B cells, granulocytes, monocytes, NK
cells, CD4þ T cells and CD8þ T cells) were included as
covariates in the model. As a sensitivity analysis, we also
performed our analysis without correction for cell type and
even in a crude model without any of the covariates, to test
the effect of these covariates on our results. We converted
raw P-values to false discovery rates (FDRs) based on
Benjamini and Hochberg.30 We used both FDR < 0.05
(raw P < 7.5  10-6) and Bonferroni corrected P-values
(raw P < 1  10-7) as significance thresholds. We tested a
dose-response effect of number of cigarettes per day on
methylation in the exposed group for those signals with
FDR < 0.05.

Mediation analysis
We tested the CpGs with FDR < 0.05 for mediation in the
association between maternal smoking during pregnancy
and birthweight, using the widely used method of Baron
and Kenny31 and the Sobel test.32 As shown in Figure 1,
mediation was considered to be present when: (i) smoking
correlated with methylation level (ba); (ii) smoking correlated with birthweight without adjusting the model for the
mediator (bc); (iii) differential methylation correlated with
birthweight (bb); (iv) the association between smoking and
birthweight decreased upon addition of methylation to the
model (bc’); and (v) the Sobel test gave P < 0.05, indicating
a decrease in the effect of smoking on birthweight after adjusting for the differentially methylated CpG. For those
CpGs showing mediation, we tested the assumption that
there is no interaction of the exposure and covariates with

the mediator CpGs.33,34 For the mediating CpGs, we further calculated which part of the association between
smoking and birthweight could be explained by the mediator using the formula:35
ð b a  b b Þ=ðð b a  b b Þþ b c0 Þ:
The mediation effect ba*bb equals bc - bc’, thus this formula
equals:
b c  b c0 = b c :

Functional network analysis
We performed network and enrichment analysis to facilitate the functional interpretation of our differentially
methylated genes using GeneMANIA.36,37 To this end, we
selected all genes to which the top CpGs (FDR < 0.05)
mapped as input, to construct a functional interaction network by adding the 100 most strongly interacting genes.
Data resources used by the GeneMANIA algorithm were
functional association datasets including genetic interactions, protein-protein, co-expression, shared protein domains and co-localization networks.36,38 Functional
enrichment analysis of all genes of the constructed interaction network against Gene Ontology (GO) terms was
performed to find the most enriched GO terms.

Replication
We performed replication analyses for the top findings of
our EWAS and mediation analysis in two independent
birth cohorts with 450 K methylation data in cord
blood samples from Caucasian children: ALSPAC
(Avon, UK)39,40 and Generation R (Rotterdam, The
Netherlands41). For the replication analyses, we analysed
data of 65 exposed and 613 unexposed offspring in
ALSPAC and 110 exposed and 635 unexposed offspring in

1228

Generation R (see Supplementary text and Supplementary
Table S1, available as Supplementary data at IJE online).
All eight GFI1 CpGs with FDR < 0.05 in the EWAS were
taken forward for replication. We limited replication to
the GFI1 gene as its CpGs showed the most robust and
clearest mediation results and GFI1 was among the genes
with the most robust EWAS signals in GECKO.
Furthermore, unlike NEUROG1, differential methylation
of GFI1 was previously reported to be associated with maternal smoking.17 Exposure in the replication cohorts was
defined as sustained maternal smoking during pregnancy
vs no maternal smoking during pregnancy, because this
was the most accurate measure of exposure in the replication cohorts. Paternal smoking was adjusted for in the mediation analysis. Except for this additional covariate,
mediation analyses were performed using the same analysis
protocol as in GECKO. In order to obtain one overall estimate of the results for each of the eight GFI1 CpGs, we
used fixed effects inverse variance meta-analysis of the results of the two replication cohorts. Subsequently, we combined results of discovery (GECKO) and replication
(ALSPAC and Generation R) stages in a joint metaanalysis. We concluded that mediation was present for
CpGs showing a two-sided P < 0.05 in both the replication
and the joint meta-analysis.

Results
General characteristics of all participants in GECKO are
presented in Table 1, for characteristics of ALSPAC and
Generation R participants see Supplementary Table S1,
available as Supplementary data at IJE online. On average,
in GECKO, smoking mothers were 1.4 years younger and
more often had a lower educational level and their children
had a 281 g lower birthweight.
We found 35 CpGs, mapping to 10 genes, that showed
differential methylation (FDR < 0.05) between the groups
exposed and unexposed to maternal smoking (Table 2).
After the more conservative Bonferroni correction, 23
CpGs remained. These 23 CpGs mapped to eight
genes: AHRR, GFI1, MYO1G, CYP1A1, NEUROG1,
CNTNAP2, FRMD4A and LRP5. All eight CpGs mapping
to GFI1, LRP5 and CNTNAP2 had lower methylation
levels in the group exposed to maternal smoking during
pregnancy compared with the unexposed group (methylation difference (beta value exposed minus beta value unexposed) ranged from 0.021 to 0.117). The 11 CpGs that
mapped to MYO1G, NEUROG1, FRMD4A and CYP1A1
had higher methylation levels in the exposed group (methylation difference ranged from 0.028 to 0.077). For AHRR,
three CpGs had lower methylation levels (methylation
difference between 0.024 and 0.073) whereas one had

higher methylation in the exposed group (methylation difference 0.038).
Effects of covariate adjustment on EWAS results
are shown in Supplementary Table S2, available as
Supplementary data at IJE online. Analysis without adjustment for cell type distribution did not substantially change
our top (Bonferroni significant) findings, but the list of
CpGs with FDR < 0.05 decreased substantially after cell
type correction.
The volcano plot in Figure 2 shows the methylation differences between the exposed and unexposed groups plotted against statistical significance. It shows the 35
differentially methylated CpGs (FDR < 0.05) and the 23
CpGs that remained statistically significant after
Bonferroni correction.
We observed no dose-response effect of number of cigarettes smoked per day on differential methylation in the
exposed group for any of the 35 top CpGs (data not
shown).
Next, we considered the 35 top CpGs to test for the
mediating effect in the association between maternal smoking and birthweight. All CpGs on the growth factor independent 1 transcription repressor (GFI1) gene (eight
CpGs) and the neurogenin 1 (NEUROG1) gene
(two CpGs) showed mediation with P < 0.07 in GECKO
(Table 3), whereas the other CpGs did not (Supplementary
Table S3, available as Supplementary data at IJE online).
None of these CpGs showed interaction with the exposure
or covariates in its effect on birthweight (Supplementary
Tables S4a–h, available as Supplementary data at IJE
online). We limited replication analysis to CpGs in GFI1
because it showed the most robust results.

a
Closest gene was NEUROG1 (57 411–57 527 bp downstream), all other CpGs were mapped within the boundaries of the given genes.

Replication and meta-analysis in ALSPAC and
Generation R confirmed the association with maternal
smoking for seven of the eight CpGs in GFI1 and mediation was replicated for three of the eight GFI1 CpGs:
cg09935388, cg14179389 and cg12876356 (Table 4).
Although not all these CpGs were significant in the two
individual replication cohorts, directions of the effects
were consistent (Supplementary Table S5, available as
Supplementary data at IJE online). Joint meta-analysis of
discovery and replication cohorts combined showed that
differential methylation of these three GFI1 CpGs explained 12–19% of the 202 g lower birthweight in smoking
mothers. For example, this was 19% for cg09935388

calculated as follows: newborns of smoking mothers had a
202 g lower birthweight compared with unexposed newborns (meta-analysis of bc, data not shown). After adding
the CpG as mediator in the model, the effect of smoking
on birthweight decreased by 37.5 g (bc  bc’ in overall
meta-analysis, see Table 4). Therefore, 37.5/202 ¼ 19% of
the 202 g lower birthweight in exposed newborns could be
explained by mediation through differential methylation.
We observed 28 enriched GO terms (FDR < 0.05) for
the 110 genes in the interaction network (Table 5). Most
enriched terms are closely related and point towards regulation of immune system processes, particularly the cellmediated immunity response.

Discussion
We aimed to examine the effect of maternal tobacco smoking during pregnancy on DNA methylation in cord blood.
Our second aim was to study the mediating effect of DNA
methylation in the association between maternal smoking
during pregnancy and offspring’s birthweight. We found
35 CpGs (FDR < 0.05) in 10 genes to be differentially
methylated in the exposed and non-exposed groups; 23 of
these CpGs (in eight genes) survived Bonferroni correction.
Furthermore, replication analysis confirmed methylation
of three GFI1 CpGs to mediate the association between
maternal smoking during pregnancy and decreased birthweight. Finally, functional network analysis showed that
the top differentially methylated genes influenced immune
system processes, particularly related to cell-mediated
immunity.
The association between smoking and methylation is
one of the most widely studied epigenetic associations and
evidence from EWASs on maternal tobacco smoking and
DNA methylation specifically in offspring is accumulating
rapidly.13–20 EWASs investigating the influence of cigarette
smoking have used a variety of DNA sources, including
placental cells,19 and studies in active smokers have been
performed in whole blood, peripheral blood,
lymphoblast DNA or lung alveolar macrophages10–12
with a generally high level of consistency across tissue and
studies. To our knowledge only a limited number of
EWASs have been published investigating the effect of
maternal smoking during pregnancy in offspring using the
450 K chip, of which only one was done in cord blood.17,18
The 23 differentially methylated CpGs mapped to eight
genes: AHRR, GFI1, MYO1G, CYP1A1, NEUROG1,
CNTNAP2, FRMD4A and LRP5. Differential methylation
of these genes (except for NEUROG1) was also observed
(but not all consistently replicated) in other EWASs in cord

International Journal of Epidemiology, 2015, Vol. 44, No. 4

and whole blood17,18 and/or in other studies into smoking
and methylation in adults.10,12,15 Previous studies related
methylation in the aryl-hydrocarbon receptor repressor
(AHRR) gene and the Cytochrome P450, family 1, subfamily A1 (CYP1A1) gene to tobacco smoke exposure in
both smokers and newborns and most studies, including
ours, reported the same CpG as the top signal
(cg05575921).10,12,15,42,43 Both AHRR and CYP1A1 are
involved in the aryl-hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) pathway,
regulating the biological responses to hydrocarbons found
in cigarette smoke and xenobiotic metabolism in
general.43–45 The myosin-1 G (MYO1G) gene is involved
in haematopoietic processes and regulation of cell elasticity.46
The
contactin-associated
protein-like
2
(CNTNAP2) gene is involved in the development of the
nervous system47 and in neuropsychiatric disorders.
Finally, the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) gene plays a role in skeletal homeostasis.48
Differential methylation of the FERM Domain Containing
4A (FRMD4A) gene has also previously been observed in
relation to tobacco smoke exposure in offspring of smoking mothers (in whole blood).18 Interestingly, single nucleotide polymorphisms in FRMD4A have been shown to
be involved in nicotine dependence.49
An important finding in our study was the mediating
effect of differential methylation of the growth factor independent 1 transcription repressor (GFI1) gene in the association between maternal smoking and birthweight. GFI1
is known to play a role in developmental processes such
as haematopoiesis and oncogenesis.50,51 Thus, GFI1 could
be involved in cellular development and possibly fetal
growth. However, it has not previously been linked to
birthweight or other anthropometric measures.
Differential methylation of NEUROG1 also seemed to
mediate the association between maternal smoking and
birthweight in GECKO; however, our discovery results
in NEUROG1 await future replication. NEUROG1 is
known to be associated with neuronal differentiation and
neurogenesis,52 making a link to fetal development plausible. It should be noted that these CpGs were not mapped
within the NEUROG1 gene regions, but located close to
this gene (57 k downstream).
To the best of our knowledge, we were the first to investigate and identify statistical evidence of mediation by
DNA methylation (in GFI1) in the pathway from maternal
tobacco smoking during pregnancy to decreased birthweight of the offspring. Meta-analysis of all three cohorts
showed that three CpGs on GFI1 explained between 12%
and 19% of the effect of maternal smoking on birthweight.
These findings are promising, as this biological mechanism
seemed to explain part of the effect of smoking on birthweight. Other mechanisms causing reduced fetal growth

The coefficients bc and bc’ can be interpreted as the amount of grams lower birthweight for smoking vs non-smoking mothers in the ‘smoking to birthweight’
and full model, respectively. bb represents the effect of methylation level (coded as a proportion between 0–1) on birthweight. For cg09935388 this means that an

may involve impaired placental perfusion, chronically low
levels of fetal oxygen supply53 and sensitivity to adipocytokines, e.g. leptin or ghrelin.54 However, it should be kept
in mind that many other factors are involved in intrauterine growth and birthweight, e.g. malnutrition or stress,55,56
and that DNA methylation could not explain the total variation in birthweight resulting from smoking. As in any epidemiological study, residual confounding could not be
entirely excluded. However, maternal smoking during
pregnancy is known to have a direct adverse effect on
growth of the fetus and is therefore likely to have a much
stronger effect on methylation than other possible confounding factors.
We performed network and enrichment analysis to facilitate the functional interpretation of our 10 differentially
methylated genes. Most enriched GO terms were related to
immune system processes, especially to those related
to cell-mediated immunity. Thus, intrauterine exposure to
components in cigarette smoke seemed to elicit an immune
response in the offspring. Such an immune response in
smokers and offspring of smoking mothers may play a role
in the increased risk of developing asthma.57 This is in line
with studies showing that the AhR pathway activates the
immune system triggered by environmental exposures such
as tobacco smoke, pollutants and diet.58,59 Additional
research will be needed to show whether these smokinginduced methylation effects may increase the risk of

developing autoimmune diseases.60–62 These results
seemed independent of cell type differences caused by maternal smoking, as we have adjusted all our analyses for
these differences, although we cannot entirely exclude that
cell correction was incomplete and residual cell (sub)type
effects could be possible.
The current study has many strengths. We found that
78% of our top CpG signals overlapped with those from a
previous EWAS on the same topic (data not shown), which
is a testament to the robustness of our findings.17
Moreover, cord blood is an excellent tissue to test for
methylation differences associated with maternal smoking,
because cord blood has not yet been exposed to external
influences other than those provided by the intrauterine environment. As such, potential confounding by those external exposures on the newborn is minimized. Use of cord
blood to study DNA methylation as a potential mediator
of birthweight is less ideal, as it implicitly assumes that it
reflects methylation patterns from other tissues such as
muscle, fat and bone that might be more plausibly causally
related to fetal growth and birthweight. However, such
tissues would be prohibitively difficult to collect from newborns and for this reason cord blood is currently the most
commonly used tissue in epidemiological studies of newborns.63 Furthermore, in (epi)genetic epidemiology the
winner’s curse is a well-known phenomenon, which means
that the effect sizes of newly identified associations are

often overestimated in the discovery cohort. For this reason we reported effect sizes of the combined analyses of
discovery and replication cohorts, which showed only partial replication of our discovery findings. We were able to
replicate three of the eight mediating CpGs in two other
cohorts, which confirmed and strengthened our results.
However it should be kept in mind that not all CpGs replicated and those CpGs that did replicate did not show such
strong mediation as in the discovery sample. Another
strength was the inclusion of the mediation analysis, giving
more insight into the biological pathway between maternal
smoking and birthweight.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to formally assess and report this mediating effect of DNA methylation.
Additionally, we gave a functional interpretation of our results using functional network and enrichment analyses,
which indicated that the differentially methylated genes
play a role in activation of immune system processes.

Finally, we used the Houseman correction with the Reinius
dataset, a popular method to adjust for differences in cell
type distributions between the exposed and unexposed
groups of six cell types (B cells, granulocytes, monocytes,
NK cells, CD4þ T cells and CD8þ T cells).28,29 This,
reassuringly, showed no alterations in our top findings. The
top signals still survived Bonferroni correction after cell type
correction; however, the larger list of CpGs that survived
FDR differed substantially (Supplementary Table S2, available as Supplementary data at IJE online). Consequently,
the gene list that was used as input for the network and functional enrichment analysis was also different. Interestingly,
the general pattern of results did not change, as we still
observed that most enriched terms pointed towards positive
regulation of particularly cell-mediated immune responses.
Furthermore, the mediation results did not change as we
observed significant mediation by the GFI1 gene and not by
any of the other genes, before and after cell type correction

(mediation results before correction are not shown).
This method was based on a reference dataset of whole
blood samples from adult males, which have a different cell
composition from cord blood, and this cell type correction
did not account for more specific cell subtypes. However,
currently this is the best option because no cord blood reference dataset exists and, even in cord blood, this referencebased cell type correction is the best method available as
recently applied by Kile and colleagues.27
In contrast to an earlier study, which observed dosedependency by maternal cotinine plasma levels,17 we did
not find an effect of the number of cigarettes smoked per
day.               17 found a dose-response relationship for
two of the significant genes, but not for all top genes. Thus,
a dose-response relationship could be expected for some
genes but not for all. Another potential reason for the lack
of a dose-response relationship in our data is our smaller
sample size compared with the study of               
A potential limitation was the use of self-reported
smoking behaviour during pregnancy. This may have

caused underreporting of smoking behaviour and possibly
could have resulted in an underestimation of the effects. In
the GECKO Drenthe cohort, 14% of the mothers smoked
during pregnancy. This is comparable to the prevalence of
7.6–13.2% found in The Netherlands in 2001–0764 and
12.3% in the USA.65 Furthermore, we observed results
that were highly comparable to the study by               
which measured smoking status objectively as plasma cotinine levels.17
We found support for our hypothesis that differential
methylation mediates part of the effect of smoking on
birthweight, but we could not be certain about the direction of causation in this observational study. One possibility is that methylation markers simply provided a better
measure of smoking exposure than the self-reported smoking behaviour we used in our study. Such biomarkers
would then also be expected to be associated with birthweight. However, the fact that only GFI1 showed significant association with birthweight and not, for example,
the AHRR cg05575921 CpG showing the strongest EWAS

1234

signal, contradicted this explanation. Another possibility
we could not entirely exclude is that retardation of fetal
growth expressed as lower birthweight led to differential
methylation rather than the other way around. However,
we believe this is unlikely given the primary role of epigenetic mechanisms in orchestrating changes in gene expression during growth and development.
We acknowledge that the Baron and Kenny approach for
mediation analysis has been criticized among others for its
dependency on and sensitivity to measurement errors, misclassification and violation of model assumptions.66,67
However, the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip is
a reliable instrument reflecting the state of the art in measurement of genome-wide DNA methylation.68 Moreover,
mediation effects of three CpG sites were independently
replicated in cord blood data from two other birth cohorts,
in spite of presumably differential measurement errors between the three cohorts. Instability of methylation over time
is an additional potentially important source of measurement error that could not be addressed by the cross-sectional design of our study, which only looked at differential
methylation at birth. We backed up our mediation results
from the Baron and Kenny approach with a more advanced
statistical approach, and additionally applied causal mediation analysis to the three replicated CpGs in the GECKO
cohort. This analysis uses a more general potential outcomes
framework, can provide additional distribution-free estimates of the mediated effects and facilitates sensitivity analyses for the observed effects.67 Results of these analyses
were in line with our Baron-Kenny results and Sobel tests
(see Supplementary Note, available as Supplementary data
at IJE online).
Previously, fathers who started smoking early were
shown to have heavier sons,69 indicating a possible direct
effect of paternal smoking on fetal programming through
the sperm epigenome, which can affect embryogenesis.70,71
We did not explicitly test this possible direct effect in our
study. However, only 39 (30%) of the fathers in the
exposed group had smoked during pregnancy and, after
excluding these children from the analysis, 83% of our top
CpGs remained Bonferroni-significant. We also controlled
for this possible paternal smoking effect in the study design, as we only included in the unexposed group those
children whose mother and father did not smoke.
Our results suggested that in utero exposure to smoking
could have an effect on selected methylation markers
which may in turn affect later health outcomes in offspring. Our approach of testing the effects of intrauterine
exposures on DNA methylation in the child may serve as
a model that could be extended to other exposures.
One example is fetal exposure to polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs), which has been linked to childhood

obesity.72 PAHs are produced during incomplete combustion and are constituents not only of cigarette smoke but
also of many other sources. Results of such studies may
then provide guidance to future prevention efforts tailored
to limit certain exposures for pregnant women with major
potential impact on public health.
In conclusion, maternal tobacco smoking during pregnancy showed genome-wide methylation differences in 35
CpGs mapped to 10 genes measured in cord blood. Our
results showed remarkable similarity to previous findings,
confirming the robustness of the effects. Additionally, we
observed a potentially mediating role of DNA methylation
in the association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and birthweight of the offspring. We were able to
replicate the mediating effect for three CpGs in GFI1,
which confirmed and strengthened our findings. Finally,
our network and enrichment analyses indicated that smoking in the mother may induce a cellular immune response
in the fetus.
