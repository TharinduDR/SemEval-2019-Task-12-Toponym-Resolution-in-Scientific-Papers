An increased risk of death in persons who have suffered spousal bereavement has been described in many
populations. The impact of modifying factors, such as chronic disease and material circumstances, is less well
understood. The authors followed 171,120 couples 60 years of age or older in a United Kingdom primary care
database between 2005 and 2010 for an average of 4 years. A total of 26,646 (15.5%) couples experienced
bereavement, with mean follow up after bereavement of 2 years. In a model adjusted for age, sex, comorbid
conditions at baseline, material deprivation based on area of residence, season, and smoking status, the hazard
ratio for mortality in the first year after bereavement was 1.25 (95% confidence interval: 1.18, 1.33). Further
adjustment for changes in comorbid conditions throughout follow up did not alter the hazard ratio for bereavement (hazard ratio = 1.27, 95% confidence interval: 1.19, 1.35). The association was strongest in individuals with
no significant chronic comorbid conditions throughout follow up (hazard ratio = 1.50, 95% confidence interval:
1.28, 1.77) and in more affluent couples (P = 0.035). In the first year after bereavement, the association between
bereavement and death is not primarily mediated through worsening or new onset of chronic disease. Good
health and material circumstances do not protect individuals from increased mortality rates after bereavement.

Death of a spouse or partner is a common major life
event for older people (1). The adverse impact of bereavement on health has been long recognized, with an increased
risk of death described in several populations (2). The increase in mortality has been most consistently described in
the ﬁrst year after bereavement, and a recent meta-analysis
estimated a 41% increase in mortality in the ﬁrst 6 months
after bereavement in all age groups (3). The consistency of
ﬁndings and robustness to adjustment suggest that the
impact of bereavement is causal, but mechanisms and modifying factors are not well understood (2). In particular, it is
not known whether good physical health and high socioeconomic status protect individuals from the adverse effects
of bereavement, and neither is the relative contribution of
acute events or worsening of chronic disease to excess
mortality after bereavement known.

Most large studies on bereavement have relied on
census databases or follow up of community surveys
(4, 5). The recording of chronic disease in such sources is
often limited or self-reported, and few studies have used
validated morbidity measures, such as the Charlson Index
(3–5). Larger studies with well-recorded comorbid conditions have limited their analyses to baseline comorbid
conditions and have not considered whether those conditions mediate or modify the impact of bereavement on
mortality (6). Two studies have explicitly examined the
modifying inﬂuence of pre-existing health on the increased risk of death after bereavement (7, 8). They
suggest, paradoxically, that good health before bereavement increases the adverse impact of bereavement rather
than providing protection, but these ﬁndings are limited
by sample size or limited information on comorbid

conditions (7, 8). Analysis of causes of death in bereaved
individuals provides some insights into whether worsening of pre-existing chronic disease or acute events contribute to excess mortality, but the evidence is unclear,
with both sudden unexpected deaths and chronic conditions contributing to excess mortality (6).
In the present study, we used a large United Kingdom
primary care database with detailed recording of comorbid
conditions to examine the modifying and mediating impact
of physical comorbid conditions and material socioeconomic circumstances on mortality in the ﬁrst year after bereavement. Unlike existing studies on bereavement, we were
uniquely able to take account of changes in comorbid conditions before and after bereavement.
Speciﬁcally, we tested whether adjustment for physicianrecorded chronic comorbid conditions before and after bereavement attenuated the association between bereavement
and mortality; such attenuation would suggest that increased mortality is mediated through worsening or new
onset of chronic conditions rather than unexpected acute
events. Furthermore, we tested whether individuals with
good health and higher socioeconomic status were protected from increased risk of death after bereavement.

The algorithm identiﬁed 316,569 patients aged 60 years
or older (47% registered patients of this age) and 32,661
patients 50–59 years of age to form a total of 174,615
couples. From this group, we excluded any couple in
which: 1) a patient had codes in their primary care record
that indicated residence in a communal establishment before
the index date, 2) a patient had inconsistent registration
details between their current and historical registration ﬁles,
or 3) both patients were 95 years of age or older. This
resulted in 171,720 couples for analysis, 76.3% of whom
were identiﬁed as living with no other household members.
Follow up

Couples were followed in the primary care record from
the index date for their practice between 2005 and 2008 to
their last practice data collection date up to September
2010. When one or both members of the couple deregistered from the participating general practice, both members
of the couple were censored from the analysis at that point.
The average follow up time was 208 weeks for women and
202 weeks for men.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data source

The Health Improvement Network (THIN, Cegedim
Strategic Data Medical Research UK) database is an established primary care database which collects anonymized
data from United Kingdom general practices and includes a
full record of diagnoses (9, 10) A feature of the THIN database is the family number, which allows practices to link
patients who live in the same household or institution (11).
Subjects

We included 401 practices from the database who were
participating in the THIN scheme between 2005 and 2008.
We identiﬁed the ﬁrst year during this period in which
the practice contributed data (2005 = 278, 2006 = 35,
2007 = 32, 2008 = 56), and used a historical patient ﬁle
from that year to identify household members registered on
the index date. This allowed us to capture the household
composition for a cohort of patients who were 60 years of
age or older on an index date between 2005 and 2008
(n = 672,543).
We based our approach to identiﬁcation of cohabiting
couples on an analysis of national survey data. This
showed that among those who were 60 years of age or
older, couples of the opposite sex with an age difference of
less than 10 years who live together in a household are
almost invariably married or cohabiting (12). We developed
an algorithm (Appendix Figure 1) that identiﬁed households that contained a person who was 60 years of age or
older living and with another adult 50 years of age or older
of opposite sex. We required that included couples had an
age difference of 10 years or less and that no younger adult
in the household be within 15 years of either of the couple.

The timing of bereavement was identiﬁed through the
earliest record of death in the deceased partner’s primary
care record, based on either a speciﬁc Read code for death
or a ﬂag on their registration ﬁle that indicated death. Read
codes are a standardized coded thesaurus of clinical terms
that are used for recording in primary care information
systems in the United Kingdom.
Bereavement was modelled as a time-dependent variable
so that after bereavement, the status of the surviving partner
was changed to bereaved and the impact of different
periods after bereavement on mortality could be examined.
We initially describe the inﬂuence of bereavement in each
consecutive 90-day period (quarter) in the ﬁrst 2 years after
partner death and then focus on death in the ﬁrst year after
bereavement for our main hypotheses. We excluded 9
couples in which both patients were recorded as having
died on the same day.
Predictors of mortality

Our main measure of comorbidity was the Charlson
Index, a validated score that weights 17 chronic physical
conditions with a score of 1–6 (13). The score is highly
predictive of 1-year mortality and has been validated in
primary care databases (14). We also examined the impact
of additional comorbid conditions not included in the
Charlson Index: coronary heart disease without a history of
myocardial infarction, atrial ﬁbrillation, and hypertension.
Inclusion of these comorbid conditions did not change our
ﬁndings with the Charlson Index alone and, for simplicity,
analysis with these additional comorbid conditions are not
presented.
Comorbid conditions were examined in 2 ways. Firstly,
the Charlson Index score was analyzed as a ﬁxed variable
determined at the start of follow up. We then examined the

effect of the Charlson Index score as a time-dependent variable updated weekly throughout follow up based on any
new diagnoses recorded in the primary care record. We
used a 1-week lag on the calculation to avoid any recorded
causes of death in the medical record being used to predict
death.
Our main measure of deprivation was the Townsend
Index, a composite small-area ecological measure of deprivation, which was assigned to couples based on their postal
code at start of follow up and summarized as quintiles
based on national ranking (15). In brief, the Townsend
score combines 4 measures of deprivation from the 2001
census (unemployment, access to a car, home ownership,
and home overcrowding) for small geographic areas in the
Am J Epidemiol. 2012;176(8):689–698

United Kingdom into a standardized score. We also examined the impact of the Index of Multiple Deprivation 2007,
an alternate small-area measure of deprivation that was
available in England only and included a wider range of
measures of deprivation (16).
Season was included as a time-dependent predictor of
mortality, with the period December to March deﬁned as
winter, in line with standard United Kingdom deﬁnitions for
examination of seasonal mortality (17). Other ﬁxed predictors were age, sex, smoking status and quantity of cigarettes
smoked (last recorded before index date), United Kingdom
region, and the presence of a younger member of the household. Missing data for smoking status and Townsend score
were included in the models as a separate category.

Analysis

A Cox proportional hazards model for mortality was developed for all couples using PROC PHREG in SAS,
version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina). The
initial model examined the impact of all predictors, including
bereavement, adjusted for age, sex, and region. Bereavement
status was entered as time-dependent variable with nonbereaved couples as the baseline group and bereavement status
deﬁned in categories based on time since bereavement.
A fully adjusted baseline model included all predictors
and Charlson Index score at beginning of follow up. A
time-dependent comorbidity model included the weekly
updated Charlson Index score in place of baseline Charlson
Index score in the fully adjusted model. All hazard ratios

were adjusted for clustering at practice level using the sandwich estimator to produce robust standard errors.
Effect modiﬁcation was examined using stratiﬁed analysis, thus estimating the bereavement coefﬁcients within
strata and allowing us to a test for heterogeneity or trend in
effects. All P values are 2-sided. This study was approved
by the South-East National Health Service Research Ethics
Committee.

couples (15.5%) experienced bereavement. The mean
follow up after bereavement was just over 2 years. Among
patients who experienced bereavement at least 1 year
before the end of their practice recording (n = 21,017),
942 died within a year (4.5%) and 1,086 (5.2%) deregistered from the practice. The rate of deregistration during
the ﬁrst year of follow up among nonbereaved couples
was 2.3%.
Predictors of mortality

Age-, sex-, and region-adjusted hazard ratios for predictors of mortality are shown in Table 2. The Charlson
Index score was a strong predictor of mortality, and the
time-dependent Charlson Index score was notably stronger. The Townsend Index also strongly predicted mortality, and within England, the Index of Multiple Deprivation
showed an almost identical impact (not shown). Similarly,
smoking status and quantity predicted mortality. Living
with a younger household member weakly predicted
mortality.
Bereavement and adjustment for comorbid conditions

The age-, sex-, region-, and season-adjusted hazard ratios
for death in the ﬁrst 8 quarters after bereavement are shown
in Figure 1. Mortality was highest in the ﬁrst 90 days after
bereavement, with the suggestion of a subsequent peak
before the ﬁrst anniversary of bereavement and attenuation
in the second year. In the ﬁrst year after bereavement, the
hazard ratio for death was 1.29 (95% conﬁdence interval
(CI): 1.21, 1.37) (Table 3). Adjustment for all baseline
Am J Epidemiol. 2012;176(8):689–698

predictors, including Charlson Index score, had little effect,
with the hazard ratio in the ﬁrst year being reduced to 1.25
(95% CI: 1.18, 1.33). Adjustment for changes in comorbid
conditions throughout follow up did not attenuate the rise
in mortality in the ﬁrst year after bereavement (hazard
ratio = 1.27 (95% CI: 1.19, 1.35).
Modification by age, sex, comorbid conditions, and
deprivation

There was no evidence that the rise in mortality in the ﬁrst
year after bereavement differed between men and women
(P = 0.99) or in those above and below the age of 75 years
(P = 0.56) (Table 4). Stratiﬁcation of analysis by Charlson
Index score at baseline showed no evidence that the mortality
increase after bereavement was more marked in subjects with
pre-existing comorbid conditions (Table 4). Further stratiﬁcation by baseline comorbid conditions and change in comorbid conditions during follow up suggested that subjects who
had no recorded conditions during follow up experienced the
largest relative rise in mortality after bereavement (hazard
ratio = 1.50, 95% CI: 1.28, 1.77).
Stratiﬁcation by Townsend score in the fully adjusted
model, including time-dependent Charlson Index score,
showed a larger effect of bereavement in the 2 most afﬂuent
groups. A test for linear trend was marginally signiﬁcant
(P = 0.035), and there was no evidence of a nonlinear relation

physician-recorded chronic comorbid conditions and social
status. Our analysis, which took into account changes in
morbidity before and after bereavement, suggested that the
rise in the mortality rate after bereavement is not primarily
mediated through new or worsening chronic physical
disease. Furthermore, there was no evidence that pre-existing
or continuing good health or afﬂuence protected individuals;
paradoxically, good health and high social status may accentuate the rise in mortality after bereavement.

We were able to examine mortality after bereavement in
a large sample of older people. Only census-based Finnish
cohorts and cohorts based on US Medicare data have included a larger number of bereaved individuals (2, 3). The
accrual of bereavement events over a relatively short time
period reduced concerns about changes in baseline exposures between start of study and bereavement, in particular
possible changes in marital status. Indeed, in our study, relocation of one partner with deregistration from their
general practitioner would lead to exclusion of the couple.
A unique strength of our study is the ability to control
for physician-recorded comorbid conditions both at baseline and during follow up using a validated mortalityprediction score. In our cohort, the Charlson Index score
adjusted for age and sex accounted for more than 80% of
the variation in mortality based on the area under the receiver operator curve for our baseline model. Such control
for comorbid conditions has not been possible in larger
studies on bereavement that have relied on self-reports or
recording of comorbid conditions at baseline only.
A potential weakness is that we identiﬁed couples indirectly through a marker of cohabitation in the primary care
record. We conﬁrmed the validity of this approach by
comparison with contemporary national representative
household surveys in England, which conﬁrmed that 99.4%
of couples selected using our criteria identify themselves as
married or cohabiting (12). In other words, very few
couples would be misclassiﬁed in terms of the nature of
their relationship, although couples with a large age difference between the partners or registered with different
general practices or practices that choose not to use the
household identiﬁer consistently would be excluded from
our analysis. These exclusions should not bias our cohabiting couples-only analysis.
Our measure of socioeconomic status was based on a
small-area ecological measure of deprivation, the Townsend
Index score, rather than individual measures, such as personal income or educational level. This measure, summarized in quintiles based on national ranking, strongly
predicted death. Studies in the United Kingdom have demonstrated the acceptability of such measures as surrogates
for individual measures of socioeconomic status, especially
when, as in our study, attributed at the subelectoral ward
level (18, 19). Furthermore, for older couples in the United
Kingdom, area-based measures may be preferable because
of changes in the meaning of individual measures of socioeconomic status with aging and the difﬁculty of measuring
socioeconomic status meaningfully in older people, which
has been well described (20). Speciﬁcally, individual measures, such as income or educational attainment, would
have a very different meaning in terms of socioeconomic
position for a 60-year-old couple before retirement and a
90-year-old woman.
Our ﬁnding that the rise in mortality after bereavement is
attenuated in the second year conﬁrms that this is not a selection effect due to shared environmental factors or the
tendency to cohabit with individuals with similar health
characteristics (8). Any such selection is unlikely to

attenuate so quickly. Speciﬁcally for our cohort, this means
that our ﬁndings are unlikely to be explained by differential
deregistration and loss to follow up of healthy individuals
after bereavement.
Comparison with other studies

Further external validation of our methods is provided by
our estimate of the rise in mortality after bereavement,
which is consistent with both United Kingdom and other
developed country studies using a range of data sources. A
recent meta-analysis estimated a relative risk of death in the
ﬁrst 6 months after bereavement of 1.41, with attenuation
of the effect over time (3). Our age- and sex-adjusted
hazard ratio of 1.29 over the ﬁrst year is also consistent
with a recent United Kingdom survey-based study (5).
Am J Epidemiol. 2012;176(8):689–698

Our ﬁndings conﬁrm that the association between bereavement and mortality is not confounded by pre-existing
chronic disease. However, compared with studies that have
reported both unadjusted and adjusted estimates, we found
that adjustment for comorbid conditions and socioeconomic
status did not attenuate the effect of bereavement, whereas
other studies have reported some attenuation (5, 7). This
difference from studies which use measures of self-reported
health may reﬂect potential bias in self-reports.
Few studies have attempted to examine effect modiﬁcation by socioeconomic status. A large census-based Finnish
study found that the relative rise in mortality after bereavement did not differ by educational status or income,
whereas an Israeli study found a greater rise in bereaved
individuals with high educational attainment (21, 22). Similarly, a Scottish census-based study found a greater impact

696            

of bereavement in individuals with higher educational attainment (8). Interestingly, an early United Kingdom study
suggested that the increased risk of death after bereavement
was largest in higher social class groups but did not test
this association statistically (23). Our ﬁndings are consistent
with these ﬁndings.
We only found 2 studies that examined the mortality rise
after bereavement by comorbid conditions or pre-existing
health. Both studies relied on self-reported health measures
(7, 8). A study in California, which included 4,747 bereaved individuals, found that the impact of bereavement
was less marked in subjects with more self-reported health
problems at baseline (7). A more recent study in Scotland,
with 14,630 bereaved subjects, found the strongest association between bereavement and mortality in those without
self-reported limited illness (8). To our knowledge, no
study to date has attempted to take account of changes in
comorbid conditions during follow up.
Implications

Our study provides a number of new and important insights into the health impact of bereavement. A key ﬁnding
is that adjustment for comorbid conditions throughout follow
up, both before and after bereavement, does not attenuate the
rise in mortality after bereavement. This ﬁnding suggests that
the early effects of bereavement are not primarily mediated
through worsening or development of chronic disease.
Studies on cause of death after bereavement have shown an
increase across a range of conditions, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, accidents, suicide, and infectious causes,
which suggests an impact on both acute health events and
chronic disease (6, 21). However, examination of a single
underlying cause of death may be subject to bias caused by
death in patients with an existing chronic disease, such as
cancer, being attributed to the chronic problem even if an
acute event is responsible. Indeed, World Health Organization coding rules for underlying cause of death promote
such attribution. Our ﬁndings tend to favor an explanation
that, at least in the early period after bereavement, the increase in mortality is mediated through acute or short-term
events, with all older people being vulnerable, irrespective of
pre-existing comorbid conditions.
This interpretation is supported by our ﬁnding that preexisting comorbid conditions do not modify the impact of
bereavement on mortality. This ﬁnding is counterintuitive,
as we expected good health to protect individuals from the
stress of major life events. However, it is consistent with
the limited studies on this question to date (7, 8). Furthermore, individuals who have good health throughout follow
up experience the greatest relative impact of bereavement
on mortality, which supports a hypothesis that much of the
excess mortality of early bereavement is due to acute unexpected events. This interpretation is biologically plausible,
as studies have identiﬁed increases in cardiovascular risk
factors and reduced immunity after bereavement, and epidemiologic studies have highlighted the marked increase in
rates of suicide and accidental deaths (24–26). Although
accidents, suicide, and other violent deaths increase after
bereavement, they cannot explain the majority of excess

deaths. Existing studies describe a 2–3-fold increase in accidental and violent deaths in the year after bereavement
(5, 24). As such deaths are uncommon in older people, accounting for 2% of deaths among those who were 60 years
of age or older in the United Kingdom; even a 3-fold increase in such deaths would account for less than one ﬁfth
of excess deaths. The most plausible explanation for most
excess mortality after bereavement is an increase in unexpected cardiac and respiratory deaths.
One caution in interpreting these ﬁndings is that we have
focused on relative increases in mortality but, of course, individuals with high levels of comorbid conditions will have
a much higher baseline mortality risk before bereavement.
Thus, in absolute terms, those individuals are likely to experience the greatest burden of excess mortality after
bereavement.
Our ﬁndings on effect modiﬁcation by socioeconomic
status are similarly counterintuitive, as we expected afﬂuence to buffer the effects of major live events. The consistency of our ﬁndings with studies in other countries
suggests that this is a real effect that is independent of cultural context. Our study has limited measures of social
support and so we cannot exclude the possibility that higher
social support compensates for poorer material circumstances. However, the presence of a younger household member
was not protective. Again, it should be noted that the
absolute effect of bereavement will be greater in lower
socioeconomic groups with higher baseline mortality.
In conclusion, our ﬁndings suggest that the rise in mortality after bereavement acts as a leveller, affording no protection to the afﬂuent or healthy, and is best explained by
an increase in sudden unexpected deaths. For health and
social services, this highlights the need to offer universal
support to older people at the time of bereavement.
