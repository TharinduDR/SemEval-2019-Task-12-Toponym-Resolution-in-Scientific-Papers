Abstract
Background: Vampire bat related rabies harms both livestock industry and public health sector in central Brazil.
The geographical distributions of vampire bat-transmitted rabies virus variants are delimited by mountain chains.
These findings were elucidated by analyzing a high conserved nucleoprotein gene. This study aims to elucidate
the detailed epidemiological characters of vampire bat-transmitted rabies virus by phylogenetic methods based on
619-nt sequence including unconserved G-L intergenic region.
Findings: The vampire bat-transmitted rabies virus isolates divided into 8 phylogenetic lineages in the previous
nucleoprotein gene analysis were divided into 10 phylogenetic lineages with significant bootstrap values. The
distributions of most variants were reconfirmed to be delimited by mountain chains. Furthermore, variants in
undulating areas have narrow distributions and are apparently separated by mountain ridges.
Conclusions: This study demonstrates that the 619-nt sequence including G-L intergenic region is more useful for
a state-level phylogenetic analysis of rabies virus than the partial nucleoprotein gene, and simultaneously that the
distribution of vampire bat-transmitted RABV variants tends to be separated not only by mountain chains but also
by mountain ridges, thus suggesting that the diversity of vampire bat-transmitted RABV variants was delimited by
geographical undulations.
Background
Rabies is a zoonosis that kills infected mammals, includ-
ing humans, and is mainly transmitted by carnivores. In
the Americas, chiropterans (insectivorous, frugivorous
and hematophagous bat) are another reservoir of this
disease. Although dog-transmitted rabies in central Bra-
zil has been reduced by aggressive vaccination programs
[1], chiroptera (particularly the common vampire bat,
Desmodus rotundas)-transmitted rabies remains endemic
in this region, and harms both the livestock industry
and the public health sector [2,3].
To date, vampire bat-transmitted rabies in livestock
has been controlled by reducing the population of vam-
pire bats and by vaccinating livestock [3,4]. However,
the depopulation of vampire bats has limitations and the
effects are temporary, while vaccination of livestock is
only carried out for some animals and is ineffective in
decreasing rabies levels in vampire bats.
For the sustainable and effective control of vampire
bat rabies, further knowledge of epidemiological fea-
tures, such as vampire bat ecology and the dynamics of
vampire bat-transmitted rabies, is necessary. Molecular
epidemiological analysis of vampire bat-transmitted cat-
tle rabies cases using the partial nucleoprotein gene,
which is the most conserved gene in the rabies virus
(RABV) genome, has suggested that the distribution of
variants in Brazil is delimited by mountain chains and
clustered in tens of thousands of square kilometers [5].
However, the vampire bats migrate several kilometers
from their nests [6]. To elucidate a more detailed
genetic clustering and geo-distribution of genetic clades
of vampire bat-transmitted RABV, 204 isolates from
Goiás, which includes the 185 isolates analyzed pre-
viously, were employed and analyzed by a phylogenetic
method based on a nucleotide sequence encompassing
the G-L intergenic region locating between glycoprotein

Results
Phylogenetic analysis
The 204 RABV isolates divided into 8 phylogenetic
lineages in the previous nucleoprotein gene analysis
were divided into 10 phylogenetic lineages with signifi-
cant bootstrap values (Figure 1; details shown in
Table 1). Isolates of the C-5 and C-6 lineages designated
by                  belonged to the A-lineage, while the
B-lineage consisted of some isolates of C-5. The C-, D-,
F- and J-lineages included isolates belonging to C-12,
C-1, C-22 and C-3, respectively. Isolates of C-20
belonged to the I-lineage, and C-21 was divided into
three lineages; G-, H- and I-lineages. Two isolates not
belonging to any lineages in previous studies were
assigned to the E-lineage.
Geographical plotting
In this study, geographical areas in Goiás were divided
by mountain chains into the Northwest, North central,
Northeast and South regions (Figure 2). Most isolates of
the A-lineage were distributed in the South region. The
B-lineage was likely to exist in the Northeast and North
central regions. The isolates belonging to the C-, E-, F-,
G-, H- and I-lineages were distributed in the Northwest
region. The G-, H- and I-lineages have narrow distribu-
tions and are apparently separated by mountain ridges
(Figure 2; Area I), while the A-lineage was distributed in
a wide range throughout a Southeastern basin (Figure 2;
Area II). The isolates of the D-lineage were plotted on
an eastern edge of the North central region. The J-line-
age had a wide geographical distribution in Goiás.
Discussion
Previous studies had elucidated that the distributions of
vampire bat and transmitted RABV are delimited by
mountain chains [5]. In the present study, it was recon-
firmed that mountain chains divide the distribution pat-
terns of each viral lineage. Furthermore, the isolates
belonging to C-5 having a wide range in Goiás were
divided into the A- and B-lineages, and were found to
be distributed in the South and North regions on either
side of a mountain chain. This finding supports Kobaya-
shi’s hypothesis that distribution of vampire bat-trans-
mitted RABV is affected by mountain chains.
The same variants of vampire bat-transmitted RABV
were spread widely in flat low lands (< 800 m), but at
higher elevations (800-1600 m), they had a narrower
distribution [9]. However, the G-, H- and I-lineages
were found to be separated by mountain ridges in low
areas (400-800 m) located in a southern undulating area
of the Northwestern region (Figure 2; Area I). Further-
more, the A-lineage was located in an eastern basin of
the South region (> 800 m; Figure 2; Area II). Consider-
ing that the higher lands showed an undulating

landscape, the results suggest that the distribution pat-
terns of vampire bat-transmitted RABV variants depend
on such undulations. On the other hand, the distribu-
tion of common vampire bats in a valley is limited by
the ridges that form the valley [10], thus supporting the
notion that the distribution of RABV variants is affected
by smaller topography than mountain chains.
Conclusions
The present study analyzed the epidemiology of vampire
bat-transmitted RABV using a 619-nt region containing
the partial glycoprotein gene and the G-L intergenic
region, and indicated that the isolates can be further
divided into several phylogenetic lineages with signifi-
cant bootstrap values when compared to characteriza-
tion based on the 203-nt partial N gene. Furthermore,
the phylogenetic lineages were divided by both moun-
tain chains and mountain ridges. In future studies, it
will be important to analyze samples from different time
points and to elucidate the dynamics of vampire bat-
transmitted rabies in order to establish effective and sus-
tainable control measures for preventing rabies circula-
tion among vampire bats.
Methods
Samples
A total of 204 samples obtained from 192 cattle, 10
horses and 2 sheep in Goiás from October 2001 to
August 2002 were employed, which had been confirmed
as rabies positive through fluorescent antibody test and
mouse inoculation test (Table 1). Viral RNA was
extracted from the brain as described previously [11].
Lineages of the 164 cattle isolates, C-1, C-3, C-5, C-6,
C-12, C-20, C-21 and C-22, were previously character-
ized based on a 203-nt sequence of the nucleoprotein
gene [5], and are shown in Table 1.
Determination of nucleotide sequences

relative to PV strain genome (Accession No. M13215) and
RVLa-1 (5435ATRGGGTCATCATAAACC    16) primer
pair were performed as described previously [11]. The tar-
get sequence includes the partial glycoprotein gene and G-
L intergenic region. Nucleotide sequences were deter-
mined using the ATGC program version 4.02 (GENETYX
Co., Tokyo, Japan).
Phylogenetioc analysis
Multiple nucleotide sequence alignments of the partial gly-
coprotein gene and G-L intergenic region were generated
by the ClustalW package in MEGA ver. 4.0 [12]. A phylo-
genetic tree was constructed by the neighbor joining (NJ)
method with bootstrap analysis (1000 psuedoreplicates)
under the p-distance model. Phylogenetic clustering sup-
ported by a bootstrap value exceeding 70% was regarded
as a reliable lineage [13]. Results were validated by the
maximum likelihood method using PhyML [14]. In order
to reconfirm the shape of the NJ tree, the ML tree was
constructed under HKY substitution model justified by
MODELTEST packaged in Hyphy program [15].
Geographical plotting
The 204 RABV isolates were plotted onto a geographical
map described using the DIVA-GIS program [16] with
GIS data from Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatís-
tica [17] and DIVA-GIS gData [18].
