To determine the demographic history of West Nile virus (WNV) in North America, we employed a coalescent
method to envelope coding region data sets for the      and      genotypes. Although the observed genetic
diversities in both genotypes were of approximately the same age, the mean rate of epidemiological growth of
the      population was approximately three times that of the      population, a finding compatible with
the recent dominance of the former genotype. However, there has also been a marked decrease in the recent
growth rate of     , suggesting that WNV has reached its peak prevalence in North America.
The introduction of exotic agents into naı̈ve ecosystems pre-
sents an ongoing challenge to public health, conservation, and
biodefense. West Nile virus (WNV; Flavivirus; Flaviviridae) is a
single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus maintained in an
enzootic cycle between Culex mosquitoes and birds. Most
mammals, notably humans and horses, are dead-end hosts.
Infection in vertebrates is usually mild or unapparent, although
disease symptoms ranging from mild febrile illness to fatal
encephalitis may occur. WNV first appeared in North America
in August 1999 in the New York City area, where it resulted in
an outbreak of encephalitis in human, avian, and equine com-
munities. Since that time, more than 19,000 human cases have
been documented in the United States (9). The first virus strain
associated with the North American outbreak, designated
     due to its detection in New York in 1999, was most
closely related to WNV strains isolated from Israel (8). In
2002, a second U.S. genotype—referred to as      since it
was first recognized as a significant entity in 2002—emerged,
and although it is closely related to     , it belongs to a
distinct phylogenetic lineage that seems to have displaced that
of its predecessor (1, 3).      has consequently been referred
to as the North American genotype of WNV (1). Given the
serious health consequences posed by introduced pathogens
such as WNV, it is important to determine their epidemiolog-
ical dynamics as they adapt to a naı̈ve environment and to
predict their future impact. To achieve this goal, we performed
a Bayesian coalescent analysis of the recent spread of WNV in
North America.
Nucleotide sequence data on American WNV isolates were
provided in this study or downloaded from GenBank. Se-
quences generated for this study were obtained from naturally
infected birds, mainly American crows (Corvus brachyrhyn-
chos), collected by the New York state WNV surveillance
program. Kidney tissue from dead birds was tested for the
presence of WNV RNA by quantitative, real-time (TaqMan)
reverse transcriptase PCR according to standard methods (7).
A total of 39 WNV-positive tissue samples from 2004 and 2005
were selected (Table 1). The complete WNV envelope (E)
coding sequence was amplified by reverse transcriptase PCR as
three overlapping fragments. Reaction products were electro-
phoretically separated on a 2% agarose gel, and sequencing
was conducted in both directions using a total of nine forward
and nine reverse primers (sequences are available upon re-
quest) with an ABI 3700 DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA). Raw sequence data were assembled and
edited using the software package from DNAStar, Inc. (Mad-
ison, WI). A minimum of twofold redundancy was required for
sequence data to be considered complete.
To conduct our coalescent analysis, we compared the E
coding region sequences from 46 and 110      and     
isolates, respectively, from samples obtained between 1999 and
2005. Approximately 70% of sequences came from samples
from avian species. Rates of nucleotide substitution and pop-
ulation growth, as well as times of origin, were estimated using
a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo method (MCMC) (pro-
gram BEAST; http://evolve.zoo.ox.ac.         ) (2). Four
models of demographic history were compared—constant pop-
ulation size and exponential, logistic, and expansion popula-
tion growth—as well as a Bayesian skyline plot which provides a
piecewise graphical depiction of demographic history, and both
strict and relaxed (uncorrelated exponential) molecular clocks.
Akaike’s information criterion was used to determine the best-fit
model, with uncertainty in parameter estimates reflected in the
95% highest-probability-density (HPD) values. All MCMC
chains were run for a sufficient number of generations to en-
sure convergence and assessed using the Tracer program (http:
//evolve.zoo.ox.ac.uk/software.html?id⫽tracer). The epidemic
doubling time (␭) was calculated using the following equation:
␭ ⫽ ln (2)/r, where r is the population growth rate estimated by

BEAST. All estimates utilized the H     model of nucleotide
substitution.
Mean rates of evolutionary change estimated under the best-
fit relaxed molecular clock model were similar for      and
    , at approximately 3 ⫻ 10⫺4
nucleotide substitutions per
site per year (Table 2). These rates are similar to those ob-
served for other RNA viruses, including members of the Fla-
viviridae (4, 6). At these rates, the mean ages of the sampled
genetic diversities (most recent common ancestors) in     
and      were 8 and 6 years, respectively. Although these
ages are compatible with epidemiological records, they suggest
that the      genotype arose some years before it was first
detected in 2001.
More notable was the contrasting epidemiological dynamics
of the      and      genotypes. Whereas a model of expo-
nential population growth was the best-fit model for     , as
expected given the spread of this genotype in North America,
the demographic history of      followed a model of logistic
population growth, in which an initially rapid growth phase is
followed by a slowdown in the growth rate (Fig. 1). The rapid
growth phase is apparent in the bottom-heavy phylogeny for
this genotype, where most lineages arose prior to 2002, and
corresponds to a mean growth rate of six new infections per

individual host animal per year, or an epidemic doubling time
of approximately 1 month. In comparison, the mean rate of
population growth for      over its sampling period (1999 to
2003) was two infections per host per year, equivalent to an
epidemic doubling time of approximately 5 months. The dis-
placement of      by      therefore occurred so rapidly
that the decline in the prevalence of      was not apparent in
our analysis. These epidemiological dynamics were confirmed
with a second analysis of 39      E gene sequences isolated
from 2004 to 2005 for which the exact day of sampling was
available (Table 1). Again, a model of logistic population
growth was supported, with a mean substitution rate of 3.597 ⫻
10⫺4
substitutions/site/year (95% HPD, 0.402 ⫻ 10⫺4
to
7.941 ⫻ 10⫺4
substitutions/site/year), an inferred age of 7.714
years (95% HPD, 1.842 to 19.415 years), and an initial growth
rate of 10.702 infections year⫺1
(95% HPD, 0.568 to 33.916
infections year⫺1
). Notably, the period of the highest growth of
     (i.e., during its rapid emergence and cocirculation with
    ) coincides with the peak in the number of human cases
reported to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion in 2002 and 2003 (5).
Although reliance on viruses drawn largely from birds raises
the possibility that our sampling is not representative, the re-
sults of the coalescent analyses are highly concordant with
epidemiological and epizootiological records, indicating that
the approach is robust. In addition, phylogenetic trees of North
American WNV show little spatial structure, and there is no
evidence for host-dependent evolutionary patterns in WNV.
Therefore, sampling bias is unlikely to have had a significant
impact on our findings.
We propose that an increased mosquito transmission effi-
cacy of      is most likely responsible for its displacement of
    .      strains are transmitted by Culex pipiens after
approximately two fewer days of extrinsic incubation than
    , leading to significant increases in the vectorial capacity
of     - compared to     -infected mosquitoes (3). Our
data on genotype-specific growth rates and epidemic doubling
times support this observation, although future experimental

verification may shed additional light on the mechanistic basis
for the genotype displacement. Finally, although      has
displaced     , there is no evidence that the population of
this currently dominant genotype is growing. In sum, these
results suggest that WNV has reached peak prevalence in
North America. Consequently, in the absence of additional
fitness increases produced by ongoing WNV evolution, future
epidemics in North America are likely to be driven by host and
environmental factors.
