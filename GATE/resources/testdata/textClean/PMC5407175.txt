Abstract
Background: A recent epigenetic hypothesis postulates that ‘a sex-specific male-line
transgenerational effect exists in humans’, which can be triggered by childhood trauma
during ‘the slow growth period’ just before puberty. The evidence is based on a few rather small epidemiological studies. We examine what response childhood trauma predicts, if any, in the birth size and prematurity risk of almost 800 000 offspring.
Methods: Children of parity 1, 2 or 3, born 1976-2002 in Sweden, for whom we could
trace both parents and all four grandparents, constituted generation 3 (G3, n ¼ 764 569).
Around 5% of their parents, G2, suffered parental (G1) death during their own childhood.
The association of such trauma in G2 with G3 prematurity and birthweight was analysed,
while controlling for confounders in G1 and G2. We examined whether the slow growth
period was extra sensitive to parental loss.
Results: Parental (G1) death during (G2) childhood predicts premature birth and lower
birthweight in the offspring generation (G3). This response is dependent on G2 gender,
G2 age at exposure and G3 parity, but not G3 gender.
Conclusions: The results are compatible with the Pembrey-Bygren hypothesis that trauma
exposure during boys’ slow growth period may trigger a transgenerational response; age
at trauma exposure among girls seems less important, suggesting a different set of pathways for any transgenerational response. Finally, parental death during childhood was not
important for the reproduction of social inequalities in birthweight and premature birth.
Key words: Childhood trauma, parental loss, transgenerational response, birthweight, prematurity, slow growth
period, inequalities, Sweden

Key Messages
• A recent epigenetic hypothesis suggests that childhood trauma may trigger a sex-specific male-line transgenerational

effect in humans.
• We studied whether death of a parent during childhood was associated with prematurity risk and birthweight deficit

in the next generation, using all Swedish births 1976-2002, for whom both parents and all four grandparents could be
traced, n ¼ 764 000.
• Parental (G1) death during (G2) childhood predicts prematurity and lower birthweight in the offspring generation

(G3). This response is dependent on G2 gender, G2 age at exposure and G3 parity, but not on G3 gender.
• The results are compatible with the hypothesis that trauma exposure during boys’ slow growth period may trigger a

response in their offspring.
• Age at trauma exposure among girls seems less important, suggesting a different set of pathways for any transge-

nerational response.

Introduction
A human being’s early experience is known to be formative
for development, physical growth, health and cognitive
ability. A suggested mechanism is ‘biological programming’ in utero or infancy. The focus on fetal and infant
growth, however, is somewhat narrow, as early social and
family circumstances may be equally important and modify early biological programming.
There is considerable continuity in birthweight,
school achievement and health across generations.1–3
One tradition has typically stressed its genetic basis. A different tradition, in the humanities and the social sciences,
has identified learning from parents and the transmission
of knowledge, material resources and social opportunity
across generations as a driver of such continuity.
The concept of ‘transgenerational response’, however,
does not focus primarily on phenotypic continuity but on
determinant-outcome associations across generations.
Here also there are two principal, but not mutually exclusive, types of pathway. Learning from parents and opportunity created by parental circumstances represent cultural
or social pathways.4 Alternatively, exposures in previous
generations may modify gene expression in later generations. Although of great theoretical interest, there is at
best scarce evidence that any transgenerational response
among humans is driven by modifications of gene expression. However, if it were a common phenomenon it would
open up new ways of thinking about disease risk, including
its prevention.5,6 Our aim in this study is to add to the
knowledge about transgenerational response among
humans by studying the association between parental loss
in childhood, and birth outcomes in the next generation.
A further question is whether or not such response may
contribute to the reproduction of health inequalities across
generations.7

We look at one particular childhood experience:
the loss of a parent through death. Such loss has consequences later in life, psychologically, for morbidity and
mortality.8–13 Carey14 suggests that childhood trauma contributes to later neuropsychiatric disorders via epigenetic
mechanisms. In mammals and plants, early exposure can
modify gene expression, not only in the soma line but in
the germ line too, without changing the DNA sequence.
Such modifications (through methylation, histone acetylation or microRNAs) represent a specific biological mechanism for transgenerational response. In mice, early
trauma caused changes in sperm microRNA content, consistent with a specific male-line response.15
Few, if any, studies on humans demonstrate such a
mechanism.               identified starvation during ‘the
slow growth period’ as a trigger of transgenerational response along the paternal line.16,17 Pembrey, following
Bygren, found that boys who took up smoking before age
11 tended to have offspring with a different metabolism
from that of other boys.18 We note two observations in
these studies: (i) ‘the slow growth period’, just before puberty, is suggested as sensitive for triggering a transgenerational response; (ii) this response, observed in successive
generations, differs by whether it is paternally or maternally transmitted. Although Pembrey and Bygren did not
have access to biological samples, their results are generally
interpreted as support for an epigenetic mechanism. The
authors themselves write18 that their studies ‘. . .provide
proof of principle that a sex-specific male line transgenerational effect exists in humans’, a point which was reinforced by the editor, Emma Whitelaw, in the same issue.19
Behind this claim is the idea that spermatogenesis is environmentally programmed during boys’ slow growth period,
which is also the period when the testis starts developing.
If trauma influenced such programming and if this had an
effect on offspring’s birth characteristics we should be able

to detect this in population studies, with data on age at
trauma exposure and birth outcomes, even without genetic
or epigenetic data.
We make no a priori assumptions about the mechanisms that cause transgenerational response. We hypothesize that (i) experiencing severe childhood trauma such as
parental death may trigger a cascade of events impacting
on development across several generations, detectable
in their children’s birth characteristics. We examine
(ii) whether the slow growth period is a sensitive ‘window
of susceptibility’, allowing such a transgenerational response to evolve, and (iii) whether its impact is similar
along paternal and maternal lines of transmission.

Methods
Population under study
The social mobility database is a large, temporary and anonymized database covering all individuals resident in Sweden at
any point after 1960 and born 1932-2002, irrespective of
country of birth. Additionally, there is information on their
biological parents from the Swedish Multigeneration Register
even when born before 1932. In total, the database consists
of 13.6 million individuals, linked to information from several Swedish national registers. We used the following: the
Population and Housing Census 1960, Cause of Death
Register 1961-2002, the Swedish Register of Education 1990
and the Swedish Medical Birth Register (MBR) 1973-2002.
Stockholm Regional Ethics Committee gave ethical permission [2009/1115-32].
We extracted all births from the MBR as generation 3
(G3) and established ancestral lineages by tracing their parents (G2) and grandparents (G1). Our study population was
restricted to single births (97.7% of all births) and to births
of parity 1, 2 or 3 (96.3%) in G3; to families where both
parents (G2) were born from 1961 onwards (i.e. it was possible to trace G1 deaths in the Cause of Death Register;

33.0%); and families with complete links between G1, G2
and G3 (83.6% of all G1-G2-G3 families). This gave 764
569 individuals in G3 with complete linkages to G2 and
G1, in total 2 876 903 unique individuals across the generations (Figure 1). Figure 2 describes birth year distributions.

Variables
Exposure
Parental (G1) death during the childhood of G2, 0-17
years, was experienced by 4.6%; in over 70% of these
cases this was the father’s death, in 2% the death of both
parents. If both parents died, G2 age at the first death was
considered. G2 age at parental loss was calculated as calendar year when the loss occurred minus birth year; then
classified as 0-2, 3-7, 8-12 or 13-17. Age 8-12 is considered
the slow growth period.
Outcomes
Birthweight was treated as a continuous variable.
Implausible values (< 0.01% of records) were removed.
Births were classified as premature (< 37 completed weeks
of gestation) or not premature.
Covariates
Education of G2 was defined as short (compulsory, 8-9
years), medium (secondary, usually 12 years), long (postsecondary/university) or missing. Missing constituted a
separate category in order not to systematically exclude the
youngest part of G2. Social class of G1 was categorized as
non-manual, self-employed, manual, other or missing.
Missing was treated as a separate category.

Method of analysis
We compared children (G3) of individuals (G2) who experienced parental (G1) death during their own childhood

with children of other G2 individuals. G3 birthweight and
prematurity were analysed by G2 age at parental death
and G2 gender, while adjusting for potential confounders/
mediators using linear or logistic regression. To take into
account the interdependence between siblings, we clustered
the standard errors at the family level throughout analyses.
Parity-specific analyses were undertaken, since previous research suggests that parity may modify transgenerational
response.20 Initially, analyses were run separately for male
and female offspring (G3). As the result did not differ (not
shown), G3 genders were combined. Variables were
categorized as in Table 1.
Confounders
Mortality falls over time. Birthweight increases.21 To account for temporal trends, the birth year of G2 individuals
was treated as a potential confounder behind any association between parental loss and offspring birth outcomes.
G1 age and social class at G2 birth predict G2 parental
loss. They may also predict both G2 birthweight22 and
education, being potential confounders. We addressed confounding by controlling for G2 birth year, age of G1
(mother) when G2 was born and social class of G1 (father)
in 1960.

Mediating factors
These help us to understand pathways between parental
loss and offspring birth characteristics. Achieved education
and age at first childbirth of G2 individuals may be influenced by a parent’s death during childhood and predict
their offspring’s birth characteristics; these are therefore
possible mediating factors. Additionally, achieved education can be viewed as a marker of earlier social circumstances and may thus at the same time confound and
mediate the association between parental death and offspring birth outcomes.
Consequently, in analyses of prematurity and birthweight, three models were applied: (1) crude differences; (2)
model 1, plus adjustment for confounding factors; and (3)
model 2, plus additional adjustments for hypothesized mediators. In birthweight analyses we considered, but avoided,
adjustments for prematurity as this may introduce ‘collider
bias’ in the estimated association.23 Examining whether any
period of boys’ childhood is particularly sensitive to parental
loss allowed us to test a recent epigenetic hypothesis.

Table 2 gives odds ratios (ORs) for premature birth of
offspring (G3) of men and women (G2) exposed to parental (G1) death, compared with offspring of non-exposed
G2. Offspring of women who lost their parent at the age of
0-2 or at the age of 13-17 had an increased risk for prematurity, after control for confounding (model 2). In all age
groups, for births with parity 3 the point estimates were
higher than for parity 1 and 2.
Combining all parities, offspring of men who lost a parent
at ages 8-12 had an increased risk of prematurity [OR ¼ 1.12
with 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03-1.23 in model 2].
The point estimates were highest for this age group within
each parity group but the parity-specific associations were
less precise, with confidence intervals including unity.
Table 3 gives estimated differences in birthweight
between offspring (G3) of individuals (G2) exposed to parental (G1) death during childhood and offspring of nonexposed G2. For women exposed to a parent’s death at age
0-2, there was no significant deficit in their offspring’s
birthweight in any parity class. For women exposed at later
ages we observed a deficit in birthweight, largest in children born as parity 3, and similar in magnitude across
ages-at-exposure.
Among children whose fathers experienced parental
loss, there was little variation between parity groups.
Experiencing parental death at ages 8-12 in particular, or
at ages 13-17, but not at ages 0-2 or 3-7, did predict having
lighter offspring (model 2). The offspring of men exposed
to parental loss at ages 8-12 were around 25-30 g lighter at
birth than other children; the birthweight deficit among
those exposed at 13-17 was around 15 g (model 2).
Adjustments for confounders (model 2 in Tables 2
and 3) had minor effects (mainly reductions) on the estimated ORs and birthweight differences, but among boys
exposed during their slow growth period, the birthweight
deficit appears to grow on adjustment for confounders.
Adjusting for G2 education and age (model 3) tended to reduce the ORs and estimated birthweight deficit, more so in
women than in men, indicating the importance of G2 education for G2 women’s offspring.

Contribution to inequalities in birthweight and
prematurity
Table 4 displays differences in prematurity risk and birthweight in G3 by G1 social class and G2 educational
achievement, after controlling for confounders (model 1).
Controlling additionally for G2 exposure to parental loss
had virtually no effect on these estimates (model 2). Thus,
experiencing parental death during childhood does not
seem important for the reproduction of social inequalities

225

in birthweight and prematurity across generations. Family
social background and parents’ education mainly exercise
their influence through other pathways.24

Discussion
Social, behavioural and natural scientists are puzzled by
how the social world gets ‘under the skin’, or how social
experience is ‘embodied’.25,26 The influence of previous
generations can be conceptualized in many ways, traditionally either as social or cultural influences or as genetic
ones. Genetic influences are not independent from those of
the (social/cultural) environment; the latter may change
gene expression.
Thus, the experiences of previous generations may influence later generations in ways that do not resemble
Mendelian inheritance based on dominant and recessive
genes. Gene expression is a more complex field than the
study of polymorphisms and random mutations and their
phenotypic correlates. The idea of transgenerational response tries to capture ancestral environmental influences,
including those of the social environment, on human development, with27,28 or without4 reference to epigenetic
modification of gene expression.
We were inspired by Pembrey and Bygren, who claimed
to have ‘proof of principle that a sex-specific male-line
transgenerational effect exists in humans’.18 We test their
hypothesis in a much larger population, while at the same
time trying to consider alternative, chiefly social, pathways.
We found that parental (G1) death during (G2) childhood predicts premature birth and lower birthweight in
the offspring generation (G3). This response is dependent
on G2 gender, G2 age at exposure and G3 parity, but not
G3 gender. Parental death during childhood was not important for the reproduction of social inequalities in birthweight and premature birth.
Our analyses rely primarily on ‘hard’ exposure (parental
death) and outcome (offspring prematurity; birthweight) data
that were available in national registers. The Cause of Death
Register and the Medical Birth Register are both virtually
complete and of the highest quality. Data on social class and
achieved education, derived from a census or the Swedish
Register of Education, are routinely used in epidemiological
studies. The Multigeneration Register allowed us to establish
complete ancestral lineages. Its data structure, however, imposes a limitation. Any G2 death before 1991 (an unlikely
event) will reduce the likelihood of tracing its G1 parents.29
The loss of a G1-G2-G3 lineage will follow. This selection
bias is likely to be small and conservative. A similar bias may
be introduced by selecting only families with complete lineages G1-G2-G3.The large size of the G3 population should
minimize random error in our results.

Model 1: controlled for confounders: age of G1 grandmother at G2 birth, social class of G1 grandfather in 1960, birth year of G2.
Model 2: controlled as Model 1 þ age of G2 at parental death.

G3 births span nearly three decades; those of their
grandparents span five. Birth years of generations of the
same family, and birth years of married couples, are correlated. By controlling for birth year of the intermediate generation, we placed the whole G1-G2-G3 family on the time
axis and controlled for temporal trends (such as in birthweight and mortality) influencing all generations, while
avoiding over-controlling.
In interpreting the results, the principal problem was to
differentiate between potential pathways, in particular between broader life-course explanations and epigenetic and
genetic explanations, as we had no information about behaviours and biological markers or genes.
We considered genetic pathways first. Could G1 deaths
during G2 childhood be a marker of G1 genetic characteristics which also predict G3 birthweight? It is known that a
child’s birthweight may predict its parents’ subsequent allcause and cardiovascular mortality, with weak associations
for fathers and stronger ones for mothers.30,31             
discussed whether this could reflect common underlying

genetic factors and concluded that, at most, this was a partial explanation. They saw no obvious reason why any genetic influence should be weaker along the paternal
pathway than the maternal and concluded31 that the stronger association between offspring birthweight and subsequent mortality of mothers was consistent with
intergenerational effects on intrauterine growth: continuity
in birthweight from mothers to their children plus fetal
programming of cardiovascular profile. In our case, birthweights of G2 women, and of their G3 offspring, are very
unlikely to be genetically linked to G2 parental loss in
childhood, since most G1 deaths were fathers rather than
mothers and since spouse correlations in birthweight are
very low (< 0.02).32 Separating the analyses by whether a
G1 death was male or female gave no indication of a genetically transmitted risk (data not shown).
For the paternal line, it seems unlikely that any common
genetic influence behind G2 parental loss and G3 birth outcomes should be particularly pronounced in those G2 men
who were exposed at ages 8-12. Sensitivity during this

228

exposure period is, however, compatible with the epigenetic hypothesis that we wanted to test.
Parental loss during childhood may influence a person
through absence of attachment to one or both parents.
Two large studies8,9 based on Swedish data found it to predict later morbidity, such as depression, and behavioural
problems, such as drug and alcohol use/abuse and crime,
as well as smoking-related cancer and HPV infection. It
has been linked to later life obesity33 and poor educational
achievement.34,35 Negative economic consequences for
the child’s family are also likely, in particular from the loss
of a father. Thus, parental loss appears to trigger a cascade
of events, psychological, behavioural, metabolic and
social.
These influence, in a broad way, the life course of G2
women and may therefore also modify the intrauterine environment experienced by their babies. We may see this as a
socially-mediated, female-line transgenerational response,
consistent with our results for exposed G2 women. It is a
general response in that, unlike for boys, trauma during
girls’ slow growth period appears to be no more detrimental
than during other periods. Repeated childbirths among the
exposed G2 women may represent a cumulative burden, resulting in the observed high birthweight deficits and prematurity ORs in parity three births. The elevated risk of G3
prematurity was observed for G2 women exposed at ages
0-2 and 13-17. In animal studies, maternal and grandmaternal stress in pregnancy, but not at later ages, has been linked
to epigenetic programming of offspring prematurity.36
Parental loss is equally likely to influence the life course
of G2 men but much less likely to directly influence the
intrauterine environment of the children they father. In our
data, the association of G2 men’s parental loss with birthweight and prematurity in the next generation seems
weaker, less general and not modified by parity. The finding that trauma during boys’ slow growth period is linked
to offspring birthweight deficit and prematurity in all models, therefore suggests a more specific pathway. Two recent
studies of mice, one of which was inspired by the PembreyBygren hypothesis, do indeed suggest that early trauma
could modify sperm microRNA, with consequences for
gene expression in subsequent generations, although the researchers could not separate the slow growth period from
the rest of puberty.14,37 Whether our finding is in fact epigenetic, carried via the male germ line as suggested by
Pembrey-Bygren, we cannot say. However, it seems entirely possible that this could be the case.
Animal studies suggest that early trauma can influence
gene expression in later generations, via the male germ
line. There are so far very few human population studies
addressing this issue. Our study fails to refute the hypothesis that a male-line epigenetic mechanism exists which

International Journal of Epidemiology, 2017, Vol. 46, No. 1

may be triggered by trauma during boys’ slow growth
period. If ancestral trauma (psychological, nutritional or
economic) can influence later generations’ health and development in such a way, this will change the way we think
of disease causation and prevention and will inspire new
studies. It would highlight the long-term importance of historical events, such as wars and famines, and cast light on
a new mechanism through which these may play a role.
