Abstract
Background: West Nile Virus (WNV) is a flavivirus that requires an efficient humoral and cellular host response for
the control of neuroinvasive infection. We previously reported the existence of six alternative open reading frame
proteins in WNV genome, one of which entitled WARF4 is exclusively restricted to the lineage I of the virus. WARF4
is able to elicit antibodies in WNV infected horses; however, there was no direct experimental proof of the
existence of this novel protein. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the in vitro production of WARF4
protein following WNV infection of cultured VERO cells and its immunity in WNV infected individuals.
Results: We produced a monoclonal antibody against WARF4 protein (MAb 3A12) which detected the novel
protein in WNV lineage I-infected, cultured VERO cells while it did not react with WNV lineage II infected cells. MAb
3A12 specificity to WARF4 protein was confirmed by its reactivity to only one peptide among four analyzed that
cover the full WARF4 amino acids sequence. In addition, WARF4 protein was expressed in the late phase of WNV
lineage I infection. Western blotting and bioinformatics analyses strongly suggest that the protein could be
translated by programmed −1 ribosomal frameshifting process. Since WARF4 is embedded in the NS4B gene, we
rename this novel protein N-NS4B/WARF4. Furthermore, serological analysis shows that N-NS4B/WARF4 is able to
elicit antibodies in WNV infected individuals.
Conclusions: N-NS4B/WARF4 is the second Alternative Reading Frame (ARF) protein that has been demonstrated
to be produced following WNV infection and might represent a novel tool for a better characterization of immune
response in WNV infected individuals. Further serological as well as functional studies are required to characterize
the function of the N-NS4B/WARF4 protein. Since the virus might actually make an extensive use of ARFs, it appears
important to investigate the novel six ARF putative proteins of WNV.

Background
West Nile virus (WNV) is an arthropod-borne virus main-
tained in a bird-mosquito transmission cycle. Birds are the
natural reservoir hosts while humans and other mammals
are dead-end hosts occasionally infected through mosquito
bite [1]. The virus, which was identified in 1937 [2], has
been the cause of sporadic cases and outbreaks of disease
in Africa, Australasia, Europe, and Middle East [3-5]. Since
1996, WNV has gained growing importance in the western
world, causing massive outbreaks and/or small clusters of
encephalitis in Europe [6-8]. The virus was introduced for
the first time in the North America in 1999 [9,10], sprea-
ding to several countries [11], and becoming a major
public health problem in the USA [12].
WNV is a small enveloped virus [13] belonging to the
Flaviviriade family, genus Flavivirus [14]. Phylogenetic
analysis reveals two distinct viral lineages, lineage I and
lineage II [15]. Lineage I is involved in human and
equine outbreaks while lineage II is not associated with
clinical manifestations in humans [15-17]. WNV genome
is a positive single-stranded RNA of about 11 kb con-
taining a single open reading frame flanked by two
untranslated regions. RNA translation produces a long
polyprotein processed by viral and cellular proteases in
three structural (C, preM/M and E) and seven non
structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A,
NS4B, NS5) [18]. Overall, the structural proteins are
involved in virus binding and penetration of host cells
[19], while the non-structural proteins are involved in
the replicative cycle [20] and induce immunological
evasion mainly through the inhibition of type I inter-
feron signaling [21,22]. Still, it has been suggested
that other unidentified factors could play a role in
the pathogenesis of WNV neuroinvasive disease [23].
              demonstrated that the NS1’ protein, a
known variant of the canonical NS1 protein, results
from a ribosomal frame shifting process [24]. The
variant protein appears to play a role in WNV neu-
roinvasiveness. We recently reported the existence of
six alternative open reading frames (ARFs) in the
WNV genome by in silico analysis. We also demon-
strated a significant antibody response to one of this
six novel putative proteins (WARF4) in the serum of
horses testing positive for antibodies to WNV. How-
ever, there was no direct experimental proof of the
in vivo existence of this novel protein [25]. The aim
of this study was to demonstrate that WARF4
protein is synthesized following WNV infection of
mammalian cultured cells. To address this objective,
a monoclonal antibody against WARF4 protein was
produced. In addition, sera of WNV infected indi-
viduals were analyzed in order to test the capacity of
WARF4 to induce an immune response in humans
as well.
Results
Generation of a mouse monoclonal antibody against
WARF4 protein
In order to demonstrate the in vitro production of the
WARF4 protein following WNV lineage I infection, a
mouse monoclonal antibody to His-WARF4 fusion protein
was generated. The selected MAb 3A12 recognized the
His-WARF4 by western blotting while it did not
show cross-reactivity with the crude lysate from E. coli
transformed with the empty vector (Figure 1).
In silico aminoacid alignment and identification of the N-
NS4B/WARF4 region detected by MAb 3A12
WARF4 is an alternative gene overlapping the COOH-
terminal region of the NS4B gene and a small NH2-
terminal portion of the NS5 gene (Figure 2). The genomic
organization of WNV implies that a −1 ribosomal frame-
shifting process translates WARF4, thus the novel protein
has been renamed N-NS4B/WARF4. The amino acid com-
position of N-NS4B/WARF4 is completely different from

the NS4B viral protein in the COOH-terminal region, this
is shown by the amino acid alignment analysis in
Figure 3A. To further support the bioinformatics evidence,
a western blotting analysis of the recombinant His-WARF4
and His-NS4B proteins employing the polyclonal anti-
NS4B antibody and MAb 3A12 was performed to demon-
strate that His-WARF4 and NS4B proteins are dissimilar
(Figure 3B). The commercial polyclonal antibody anti-
NS4B was developed to a NS4B fragment from AA 126 to
AA 145, which thus overlaps the first 14 AA of the N-
NS4B/WARF4 COOH-terminal region. As shown in
Figure 3B (lane 4), the anti-NS4B antibody did not recog-
nized the recombinant His-WARF4 protein. The recombin-
ant His-NS4B fragment encompasses the COOH-terminal
portion of NS4B starting from AA 120 thus including the
entire ARF coding sequence. In addition, MAb 3A12 did
not recognize the His-NS4B fragment (lane 9).
The N-NS4B/WARF4 region recognized by MAb 3A12
was identified by analyzing MAb 3A12 reactivity to four
synthetic overlapping peptides (SP1, SP2, SP3, SP4) which
cover the full N-NS4B/WARF4 COOH-terminal amino
acids sequence (Figure 4). The four synthetic peptides, as
well as recombinant His-WARF4, His-NS4B, Env proteins
and Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) were spotted in repli-
cates on nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes (panels A,
B, C) were then reacted with MAb 3A12, anti-NS4B anti-
body and anti-His antibody respectively. As shown in
Figure 4, MAb 3A12 recognized only SP2, while lacking re-
activity to His-NS4B, His-EnV and BSA. Conversely, anti-
NS4B or anti-His antibody did not recognize any of the

genomic organization is shown. WARF4 is dashed, the
first and the last base of the alternative reading frame are pointed by stars. On the top, the synthesis of NS4B by canonical translation mechanism
in 0 frame and maturation is shown. Below is displayed the proposed mechanism of N-NS4B/WARF4 synthesis through translation in −1 frame.
The amino acids sequences of the two proteins are showed, the different COOH terminals of the two proteins are underlined.

WARF4 peptides. These results corroborate the specificity
of MAb 3A12 to N-NS4B/WARF4 protein and allow to
recognize the epitope of MAb 3A12 between amino acids
165–212 of N-NS4B/WARF4 sequence.
Expression of N-NS4B/WARF4 protein in WNV lineage I
infected cells
Expression of N-NS4B/WARF4 following WNV lineage I
infection of VERO cells in vitro was demonstrated by
immunofluorescence and western blotting analyses emplo-
ying MAb 3A12. Figure 5 shows the reactivity of MAb
3A12 with uninfected and infected VERO cells. MAb 3A12
showed a strong cytoplasmic immunoreactivity in infected
cells (panel b), while it did not react with uninfected
cells (panel c). MO      was used as negative control
(panel a and c).
In order to determine the apparent molecular weight
of the in vitro produced N-NS4B/WARF4 protein,
western blotting analysis was carried out. As shown in
Figure 6, in infected VERO cell lysate MAb 3A12 detected
a protein showing an apparent molecular weight of about
28 kDa (lane 3). Recombinant His-WARF4 (lane 1) was
used as positive control. No reactivity of MAb 3A12
was observed with uninfected VERO cells (lane2).
The commercially available anti-NS4B antibody was
used as positive control to monitor the infection of
VERO cells by WNV (lane 4) and to compare the apparent
molecular weight of NS4B protein to N-NS4B/WARF4
protein. Our result shows that the electrophoretic mobility
of N-NS4B/WARF4 is slightly lower than that of NS4B.
The recombinant His-NS4B was used as positive control
for anti-NS4B antibody (lane 6).
Next, the expression of N-NS4B/WARF4 was evaluated
and compared to the expression of NS4B protein through
a time-course infection (24–72 hours). Figure 7 shows the
results of western blotting analysis performed with MAb

N-NS4B/WARF4 protein relative to the terminal region of NS4B protein. The first three lanes show the reactivity of the anti-His antibody with
the His-tagged proteins used in the same western blotting as positive controls. The anti-NS4B antibody did not react with the His-WARF4 protein
(lane 4). Similarly, the MAb 3A12 did not react with His-NS4B protein (lane 9). The His-Envelope protein was used as negative control.

NS4B/WARF4 and NS4B proteins show similar kinetics
of expression after WNV lineage I infection, the highest
level of expression of both in the late phase of infection.
N-NS4B/WARF4 expression is restricted to WNV lineage I
To corroborate bioinformatic analysis indicating that
N-NS4B/WARF4 is restricted to WNV lineage I, the
reactivity of MAb 3A12 was analyzed against WNV lineage
II infected VERO cells (Figure 8). Infection of VERO cells
was performed for 72 hours with WNV lineage I and
lineage II. Western blotting analysis shows that MAb 3A12
identifies N-NS4B/WARF4 protein in the WNV lineage I
infected VERO cells (panel A, line 3) but not in WNV
lineage II infected VERO cells (panel A, line 4). To monitor
infection of VERO cells by WNV lineage I and II, infected
cells were also analyzed for the expression of matrix
protein (M) employing the anti-M antibody (panel B). The
anti-M antibody recognized the mature form of M protein
showing a molecular weight of about 8 kD in both
lineage I and II WNV infected cells (line 3 and 4).
The antibody also detected an additional band representing
the immature form of the M protein (preM/M). Recom-
binant His-WARF4 and His-PreM/M proteins were used
as positive controls.
N-NS4B/WARF4 induces antibodies in WNV infected
individuals
In order to determine whether human sera from WNV
infected individuals were able to recognize N-NS4B/
WARF4 protein, western blotting analysis was carried
out. Reactivity of human sera to His-WARF4 protein
was compared to that of 3 other recombinant WNV
proteins, including the domain III of the envelope, a
preM/M fragment and the NH2-terminal portion of NS5
(Figure 9A). Eight human sera, 4 of which positive for

full amino acids sequence codified by WARF4 is shown on the top. The amino acids sequence of the four synthetic peptides is showed in the
center, the overlapping sequences among the contiguous peptides are underlined. Peptides (500 ng), Envelope protein and BSA (500 ng) and

antibody (panel B) and MAb anti-His (panel C). The star shows the peptide (SP2) recognized by MAb 3A12.

IgGs anti-WNV, were assayed. Sera from individuals
testing negative for WNV by IFA and seroneutralization
test were also negative for reactivity with recombinant
WNV proteins. Conversely, sera from individuals tes-
ting positive for WNV by IFA and seroneutralization
test showed different patterns of reactivity with the
recombinant proteins analyzed (Figure 9B). Two sera were
able to react with His-WARF4. Of these, one was able to
recognize also the His-preM/M, His-NS5 and His-EnvIII
proteins while the other recognized only the preM/M. In
addition, one serum was able to detected EnvIII only,
while another produced a weakly positive signal for the

Bioinformatic results
Alignment and cluster analysis of 384 WNV strains
assigned 368 samples to lineage I according to previous
studies [15] (Figure 10, Table 1). WARF4 was found in 361
genomes out of 368 belonging to lineage I. Two different
mutually exclusive slippery sequences within the NS4B
gene were detected in the WARF4 group. The first
slippery sequence (UUUUUUG), with a pseudknot struc-
ture of 80 nucleotides (ΔG −27.8 kcal/mol) [bps 7268, an.
    0967] positioned 6 nucleotides downstream, is shared
by 91% of genomes. The second slippery sequence
(CCCUUUG/T), with a downstream pseudknot structure
of 40 nucleotides (ΔG −14.5 kcal/mol) [bps 7174, an.
    0968] positioned 8 nucleotides downstream, is
shared by 5% of genomes. The WARF4 sub-group
genomes lacking slippery sequences are 4%.
Discussion
The use of ARFs in viruses belonging to the Flaviviriade
family was first reported for the hepatitis C viruses [26,27].
Recently, it has been demonstrated that WNV uses a short
ARF, termed foo, for the synthesis of NS1’, a known variant
of the canonical NS1 [24,28]. We earlier reported the pre-
sence of other ARFs embedded in the coding frame of the
WNV genome [25]. Our bioinformatic analysis detected six
ARFs, one of which, designed WARF4, was the longest and
restricted exclusively to lineage I of WNV. Since WARF4 is
embedded in the NS4B gene, the novel protein has been
renamed N-NS4B/WARF4. Our results suggested the
production of N-NS4B/WARF4 protein in WNV infected
horses because of their ability to mount a humoral immune
response to N-NS4B/WARF4. However, there was no di-
rect evidence proving the actual existence of the N-NS4B/
WARF4 protein. In order to demonstrate the production of
N-NS4B/WARF4 in vitro after WNV cells infection, we
produced a monoclonal antibody to the N-NS4B/WARF4
COOH-terminal amino acid sequence (MAb 3A12). MAb
3A12 strongly reacted with VERO WNV infected cells by
immunofluorescence and detected a ~ 28-kDa protein by
western blotting. The predicted aminoacids of N-NS4B/
WARF4 preclude the possibility that MAb 3A12 could
react with epitopes shared with the NS4B protein
(Figure 3A), however to support this prediction a western
blotting analysis was performed. As shown in Figure 3B,
MAb 3A12 did not recognize the recombinant COOH ter-
minal portion of the recombinant his-tagged NS4B protein.
In addition, the anti-NS4B did not recognize the recombin-
ant His-tagged WARF4 protein. To definitely asses the spe-
cificity of MAb 3A12 against the alternative reading frame,
four overlapping peptides covering the full N-NS4B/
WARF4 COOH- terminal amino acid sequence were
synthesized and analyzed for their reactivity to MAb 3A12.
As shown in Figure 4 the results confirm the specificity of
the monoclonal antibody and allow to recognize its epitope
between the amino acids 165–212 of N-NS4B/WARF4
sequence. In addition we demonstrated that N-NS4B/
WARF4 protein expression is restricted to WNV lineage I
infection and that it is expressed at high level in the late
phase of infection (Figures 7, 8). Overall, our results
Figure 9 Immune recognition of His-WARF4 by WNV-positive human sera. Eight human sera, 4 of which positive for IgGs anti-WNV by IFA
were analyzed for the presence of anti-N-NS4B/WARF4 antibodies by western blotting. The assay was performed by testing simultaneously the
reactivity to 3 other recombinant WNV proteins: the domain III of the Envelope, a prem/M protein fragment and the NH2-terminal portion of NS5.
Panel A shows the 4 recombinant proteins stained with the comassie-blue. Panel B shows the results of the western blotting analysis; 4 human
sera testing negative for IgGs-anti WNV (1–4) showed no reactivity with the four antigens. The WNV-positive human sera (5–8) showed a different
reactivity with the four recombinant antigens. Two sera (7, 8) reacted with His-WARF4 protein.

demonstrate that N-NS4B/WARF4 is a novel protein,
different from NS4B, and that is expressed in WNV
infected cells.
Furthermore, we indirectly demonstrated the “in vivo”
production of N-NS4B/WARF4 by showing its immu-
noreactivity with human sera obtained from WNV
infected patients (Figure 9). The heterogeneous reactivity
to the recombinant WNV antigens displayed by sera
testing positive for WNV reflects the complex humoral
response elicited by WNV infection [29,30]. In addition, it
is known that the ARF proteins are expressed with both
less and variable efficiency if compared to the canonical
proteins [31].
To date, we have no experimental information on
N-NS4B/WARF4 protein translation, but it appears reaso-
nable to assume that a −1 ribosomal frame shifting me-
chanism produces the novel protein. Indeed, in Flaviviriade
the translation process is implemented by a cap-dependent
scanning process, which produces a single polyprotein [32].
The sequence encoding N-NS4B/WARF4 COOH-terminal
is in −1 frame, moreover it is far from the 50
terminal end,
lacks an AUG codon and no internal ribosomal entry site
(IRES) is described for WNV. The translation by ribosomal
frame shifting is the only realistic explanation for N-NS4B/
WARF4 protein synthesis. Since the proposed model
requires the presence of specific RNA structures such as
slippery sequences associated with pseudknot [33-35], a
bioinformatics analysis was performed to predict these
structures. All the complete genomes of WNV available on
gene bank were aligned and assigned to the two main
lineages (Figure 10, Table 1). The strains belonging to the
lineage 1 were first analyzed to confirm the association with
WARF4 and then a further analysis was carried out looking
for slippery sequences and pseudknot structure within the
NS4B coding region. WARF4 was detected in 361 out of
368 genomes belonging to lineage 1. Seven genomes lacked
WARF4 because of a single nucleotide substitution that
interrupts the alternative frame. In the WARF4 group, two
different and mutually exclusive slippery sequences with
downstream frameshift-stimulating pseudknot structures
were predicted. The first UUUUUUG sequence is the
most representative (91%). The pseudknot structure is
Figure 10 UPMGA analysis of WNV genomes. The image summarizes the results of the bioinformatics analysis. Some reference strains are
shown. Sequence alignment identifies WARF4 in 98% of strain belonging to lineage I (black collapsed form). The WARF4 group (dashed) may be
further separated in two groups, depending on the type of programmed −1 ribosomal frame shifting sequence detected. Group 1 carries the
UUUUUUG slyppery sequence. Group 2 carries the CCCUUUG/T slippery sequence. The two pseudoknot sequences with the predicted base
pairing are shown. The slippery sequences are in gray while the stop codon (AUG) and the first codon (GGC) of WARF4 are underlineed.

80 nucleotides long and includes the initial aminoacids co-
dified by the −1 frame. This slippery sequence is associated
with the American viral strains. The second CCCUUUG/T
sequence is present in 5% of the genomes, it is positioned
129 nucleotide upstream of WARF4 and has a pseudoknot
structure of 40 nucleotides. The second slippery sequence
is associated with circulating viral strain in Mediteranean
Bacin and Est-Europe. The strain analyzed in this
work belongs to this second group [Egyptian strain,
an.     0968]. It should be noticed that both the
structures must promote the suppression of a termination
codon (UGA) located just before the first codon of −1
frame [36].
The ribosomal frameshifting model also explains the
discrepancy between the predicted and the observed
molecular weight of the alternative N-NS4B/WARF4. The
predicted alternative reading frame protein consists of 148
AA that account for a molecular weight of 16,7 kDa. How-
ever, the protein detected by MAb 3A12 in WNV infected
cells migrates with an apparent molecular weight of about
28–30 kDa. Although this discrepancy could be due to a
post-translation modification, the proposed model appears
the most reasonable explanation for the observed molecular
weight of N-NS4B/WARF4 protein. The novel protein
would exist as COOH-terminal variant of the NS4B pro-
tein, indeed, the ribosomal shift in −1 frame would give rise
to a NS4B variant protein where the last 123 AA should be
replaced by a longer amino acid tail of 148 A. Thus, the
variant protein should exhibit a molecular weight of about
30 kDa, consistent with our results (Figure 6, lane 3). The
proposed ribosomal frameshifting model implies that the
expression kinetic of N-NS4B/WARF4 should be like that
of NS4B protein even if the amount of the novel protein
should be less than that of NS4B. Figure 7 shows the
expression of N-NS4B/WARF4 and NS4B in time-corse
infection, the two proteins exhibit a similar kinetics.
N-NS4B/WARF4 is clearly detected in the late phase of
infection, such as the NS4B protein. The level of NS4B and
N-NS4B/WARF4 proteins expression based on a densito-
metric analysis (data not shown) indicates a ratio of about
25 to 1 respectively. It should be highlighted that this ratio
is estimated for the strain Eg101 [an.     0968] that our
biofinformatic analysis associates with the strain circulating
in the Mediterranea area (Figure 10). The predicted
pseudoknot associated with the American strain is
thermodinamically more stable. It should be intersting to
estimate this ratio in the American viral strain.
Conclusions
Overall, our results show for the first time that the novel
ARF protein, N-NS4B/WARF4, is produced during the
late stage of WNV lineage I infection and that N-NS4B/
WARF4 is able to elicit antibodies in WNV infected
individuals. To date, the biological function of N-NS4B/
WARF4 and the role of anti- NS4B/WARF4 antibodies
are unknown; however, it is suggestive that N-NS4B/
WARF4 is restricted exclusively to the lineage I of WNV,
which is known to be associated with the more severe cli-
nical manifestations of WNV disease. This protein might
represent a novel tool for a better understanding of WNV
biology and for an improved characterization of immune
response in WNV infected individuals.
Methods
Cell culture and virus strain
The VERO E6 cell line was cultured in Eagle’s minimal
essential medium (MEM) with 10% Fetal Calf Serum
(FCS), 100 U/mL penicillin, 200 μg/mL streptomycin in
the presence of 5% CO2. WNV lineage I [strain Eg101,
an.     0968] and WNV lineage II [strain B956, an.
    2665] were propagated by infecting VERO E6 cells
monolayers in MEM with 2% FCS and titrated according
to the Reed and Muench formula.
Additional WNV genomic RNA [strain NY 1999, an.
    0967] was obtained from European Network for
Diagnostics of Imported Viral Disease (http://www.enivd.
de/ENIVD_P.HTM) during the External Quality Assurance
(EQA) for molecular detection of West Nile virus. The
nucleic acids were extracted by NucleoSpin RNA Virus kit
according to manufacturer’s instructions (Macherey-Nagel,
Düren, Germany).
Expression of WARF4, NS4, envelope, preM/M and NS5
recombinant proteins
Since the previously described recombinant His-WARF4
protein [25] does not comprise the full alternative reading
frame, we cloned a novel fragment which includes the
entire ARF. The 444 bps fragment spanning the WARF4
position 7311–7754 [accession number     0967] was
amplified in a single step by Superscript III One step
RT-PCR, (Invitrogen, California). The fragment was
cloned in pRSET vector and expressed in the     
Star (DE3)pLysS competent cells (Invitrogen, California).
Other WNV recombinant proteins including the domain
III of the Envelope (Env III), a preM/M and a NS5 fragment
were produced as described above using primers and
vectors reported in Table 2. The NS4B fragment was
expressed by Rapid Translation System 100 E.coli HY
(www.5PRIME.com). The His-tagged recombinant proteins
were purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography kit
according to manufacturer’s instructions (QIAGEN, Hilden,
Germany). All the oligonucleotides were synthesized by
Eurofins MWG Operon (www.eurofinsdna.com).
Production of a monoclonal antibody (MAb) recognizing
the WARF4 recombinant protein
Four week-old BALB/mice were immunized twice by
intraperitonal injection with 25 μg of purified His-WARF4
                Virology Journal 2012, 9:283 Page 11 of 14
http://www.virologyj.com/content/       
protein emulsified in RIBI adjuvant (RBI Immununo-
chemical Research). Mice were then given a booster
immunization intravenously with 10 μg of the immunogen,
and immune splenocytes were removed 3 days later.
Somatic cell hybrids were prepared with NS-1 mouse
non secreting myeloma cells as previously described
[37-39]. Hybridoma supernatants were screened for diffe-
rential immunoreactivity to His-WARF4 and His-purified
control proteins by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay
[40,41]. Positive hybridoma cell lines were cloned
twice by limiting dilution. One MAb was selected and
designed 3A12.
Peptide scanning analysis
Four synthetic peptides named SP1, SP2, SP3 and SP4,
which cover the full N-NS4B/WARF4 COOH-terminal
amino acid sequence and which have amino acids
overlapping sequences were designed (Figure 4).
SP1 (H-GNALSPAADSGWNHEKRCSGWHRGHGRPR
IRAHHTHHAEESWANHA), SP2 (H-THHAEESWANH
ADLGVSSCSSSEPVCEDSARSRNSDHGSSGDTLGEW),
SP3 (H-SDHGSSGDTLGEWSKLCLECNNCHRTLPHHA
WGLVVMLIHNMDTHKE) and SP4 (HVVMLIHNMDTH
KEHGKTRTKKRWGKGTHLGRGLERKTQPDDKRRVH)
were synthesized by PEPSCAN (www.pepscan.com). Five
hundred ng of peptide as well as Env and BSA proteins, 50
ng of His-WARF4 and 200 ng of His-NS4B were spotted in
replicates on nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were
blocked for 4 h at RT in 5% non-fat dry milk-PBS-0.1%
Tween-20 and incubated 1 hour at RT with MAb 3A12,
anti-NS4B antibody (Abcam plc, Cambridge, UK) and
MAb anti-Histidine (Invitrogen). The membranes
were washed four times and then incubated with goat
anti-mouse or rabbit IgG peroxidase-conjugated antibodies
(Sigma, MI, IT) and developed by a chemiluminescent kit
(Sigma, MI, IT) as previously described [42,43].
Indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA)
The VERO E6 cell line was grown in eight wells Chamber
slides™
(Nunc, USA). 200 μl of a viral suspension (104
xTC    /ml) were used to infect VERO cells monolayers
(40-50% confluent). WNV was subsequently allowed to
adsorb for 1 hour at 37°C. MEM medium with 2% FCS,
was then added to the infected cells monolayer. After 36
hours, the cells monolayer was washed 2 times in PBS 1X
and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room
temperature, followed by treatment with 0.1 M glycine for
20 min at 25°C and with 0.1% Triton X-100 for an
additional 5 min at 25°C to allow permeabilization.
Cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with
MAb 3A12 or the antibody MO      used as negative
control as previously described [44,45]. Nuclei were
stained with Hoechst 33342 (blue).
Western blotting analysis
The VERO cells were infected with a multiplicity of
infection (MOI) of 0.1 for 24 to 72 hours or for 96 hours
at 37°C in 5% CO2. Cells were scraped and harvested by
centrifugation at 1,500 X g at 4°C and rinsed in ice-cold
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cell lysates were
prepared in Staph A buffer (10 mM sodium phosphate
pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM EGTA, 1% Triton,
0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate) containing 1 mM PMSF
[46,47] and a protease inhibitor cocktail (complete Mini
EDTA-free, Roche). Proteins from uninfected and infected
VERO cells lysate (50 μg/well) or purified recombinant
WARF4 (10–100 ng/well), Env III (10–100 ng/well), preM
(100 ng/well), NS5 (100 ng/well), NS4B (10 ng/well)
protein fragments were separated on a NuPAGE 4-12% or
12% Bis-Tris gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose mem-
branes (Invitrogen) [48]. Membranes were blocked for 6 h
at 4°C in 5% nonfat dry milk-PBS-0.1% Tween-20
and incubated overnight at 4°C with MAb 3A12,
anti-NS4b antibody, anti-M (Abcam plc, Cambridge,
UK) or human sera (dilution 1:100). The membranes
were washed four times and then incubated with
goat anti-mouse IgG, anti-rabbit or anti-human IgG
peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (Sigma, MI, IT) and
developed by a chemiluminescent kit (Sigma, MI, IT) as
previously described [42,49].
Human sera
Human serum samples, obtained from convalescent
patients suffering from neuro-invasive WNV infection,
testing positive for IgGs anti-West Nile by IFA and con-
firmed by Micro-Neutralization Test Assay - MNTA [50]

Malpighi University Hospital, University of Bologna,
Bologna, Italy). Human sera from healthy donors testing
negative for IgGs anti-West Nile were used as negative
controls.
Bioinformatic analysis
384 full genomes of WNV were retrived from gene bank
and aligned with BioNumerics software package (version
6.5 Applied-Maths, Belgium). Genomes were further
analized by KnotInFrame software (http://bibiserv.techfak.
uni-bielefeld.               ) to predict ribosomal −1
frameshift sites with a pseudoknot strucuture.
Human sera and experimental animals
Human sera were collected after informed consent and
sent to the Regional Reference Centre for Microbiological
Emergencies (CRREM, Prof. Vittorio Sambri, St. Orsola-
Malpighi University Hospital, University of Bologna,
Bologna, Italy). The protocol was approved under the
regional plan of surveillance and control for west nile
disease in Emilia Romagna (5 June 2009, prot.         
128190).
Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and later
the spleens were removed by surgical resection. The proce-
dures were carried out in the presence of a veterinarian
who monitored proper compliance with the decree law
116/92. The protocol was approved by the ethics
committee of the Station Technology for Animal
(STA) (http://www.sta.uniroma2.it/) of the University of
Rome “Tor Vergata” on           .
