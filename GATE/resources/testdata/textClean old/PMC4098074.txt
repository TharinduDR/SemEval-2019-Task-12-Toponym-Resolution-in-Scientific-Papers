Abstract
In Croatia, several rodent- and vector-borne agents are endemic and of medical importance. In this study, we
investigated hantaviruses and, for the first time, tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and Rickettsia spp. in small
wild rodents from two different sites (mountainous and lowland region) in Croatia. In total, 194 transudate and
tissue samples from 170 rodents (A. flavicollis, n = 115; A. agrarius, n = 2; Myodes glareolus, n = 53) were tested
for antibodies by indirect immunoflourescence assays (IIFT) and for nucleic acids by conventional (hantaviruses)
and real-time RT-/PCRs (TBEV and Rickettsia spp.). A total of 25.5% (24/94) of the rodents from the moun-
tainous area revealed specific antibodies against hantaviruses. In all, 21.3% (20/94) of the samples from the
mountainous area and 29.0% (9/31) from the lowland area yielded positive results for either Puumala virus
(PUUV) or Dobrava–Belgrade virus (DOBV) using a conventional RT-PCR. All processed samples (n = 194)
were negative for TBEV by IIFT or real-time RT-PCR. Serological evidence of rickettsial infection was detected
in 4.3% (4/94) rodents from the mountainous region. Another 3.2% (3/94) rodents were positive for Rickettsia
spp. by real-time PCR. None of the rodents (n = 76) from the lowland area were positive for Rickettsia spp. by
real-time PCR. Dual infection of PUUV and Rickettsia spp. was found in one M. glareolus from the mountainous
area by RT-PCR and real-time PCR, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first detection of Rickettsia spp.
in small rodents from Croatia. Phylogenetic analyses of S- and M-segment sequences obtained from the two
study sites revealed well-supported subgroups in Croatian PUUV and DOBV. Although somewhat limited, our
data showed occurrence and prevalence of PUUV, DOBV, and rickettsiae in Croatia. Further studies are
warranted to confirm these data and to determine the Rickettsia species present in rodents in these areas.

Introduction
Croatia is endemic for various zoonotic agents. Due to
biological and ecological diversity, differences in oc-
currence and prevalence of various pathogens in small rodent
populations can be expected throughout the country (Mar-
kotić        2009).
Hantaviruses (family Bunyaviridae) may be the most im-
portant rodent-borne pathogens in the country. Human infec-
tions caused by hantaviruses are endemic, with hemorrhagic
fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) cases varying between
sporadic annual reports of 30 cases (Epidemiology Unit of the
Croatian National Institute of Public Health) up to epidemic
occurrence with 400 human cases (              2005). In
Croatia, as well as in Europe, several hantaviruses are circu-
lating with Puumala virus (PUUV) and Dobrava–Belgrade
virus (DOBV) being of medical importance (Markotić       
2002,               2005). Tula (TULV) and Saaremaa
(SAAV) viruses have also been reported, but the medical im-
portance is unknown (                       2002,          
       2011).
Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV, family Flavivir-
idae), transmitted by Ixodes ticks, is endemic in parts of
Europe, including northern Croatia. It causes human infec-
tions of the central nervous system (                 2009,
              2012), with up to 50 reported cases annually in

Croatia (Borcić        1999). For Croatia, only few ser-
oepidemiological data regarding TBEV in humans are
available (Borcić        1999, Miletić-              2011).
Limited data have suggested small rodents as a reservoir of
this virus (              2011,             2012). Rodents may
also be key hosts for amplification of TBEV in the natural
transmission cycle (Süss 2003,               2012). However,
this aspect has not been investigated in Croatia so far.
Rickettsiae (genus Rickettsia) are obligate intracellular
bacteria transmitted by arthropods, causing human diseases
of various severities (Roux and Raoult 2000). Rodents have
been suggested to act as reservoir hosts for certain rickettsiae
(             2011). In Croatia, data regarding rickettsioses in
humans are very limited. Due to unspecific clinical symp-
toms, human cases may be misdiagnosed and undetected. On
average, seven cases are recorded annually (Epidemiology
Unit of the Croatian National Institute of Public Health). The
human seroprevalence against spotted fever group (SFG)
rickettsiae varies between £ 44% in southern Croatia (Punda-
Polić        2003) and £ 7.1% in continental Croatia (      
       2011). So far, no epidemiological data exists for the
mountainous area of the country.
Identification of reservoir hosts of zoonotic agents is a
prerequisite for an effective prevention of human infections.
Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the oc-
currence and prevalence of Rickettsia spp. and TBEV and to
determine the prevalence of hantaviruses in small wild ro-
dents in two geographically and ecologically distinct locali-
ties in Croatia.
Materials and Methods
Study sites
Gerovo is located in a mountainous area of Gorski kotar
adjacent to the border of Slovenia, approximately 150 km
southwest of the Croatian capital of Zagreb (Fig. 1). The area
is covered in deciduous (beech) and mixed coniferous forests
(beech and fir). Žutica lies within a lowland area in central
Croatia, approximately 50 km southeast of Zagreb (Fig. 1).
This area is characterized as a floodplain deciduous common
oak forest. Both localities are being exploited for timber and
are known recreational areas for tourists and sportsmen.
Animal samples
During November, 2007, 76 rodents were trapped at Žu-
tica, and from April to May, 2008, 94 rodents were collected
at Gerovo using snap traps. Guidelines by              
(2007) were followed. Trapping was performed along linear
transects at 100 meters above sea level (a.s.l.) in Žutica and
from 360 to 1220 meters a.s.l. in Gerovo. Tissue samples
(n = 194) available for investigation in this study were lung
(n = 75) and kidney (n = 25) from rodents trapped at Žutica
and heart tissue (n = 94) from animals captured at Gerovo.
Hearts were stored in 0.5 mL of phosphate-buffered saline
solution. All samples were stored at - 80C until further in-
vestigation.
Detection of anti-hantavirus, anti-TBEV,
and anti-Rickettsia spp. antibodies
Transudate was collected from heart tissue (n = 94), and
10 lL were tested undiluted for the presence of immuno-
globulin G (IgG) antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence
tests (IIFTs) as recommended by the manufacturer. Hanta-
virus Mosaic 1 (Euroimmun AG, Lübeck, Germany), TBE
virus (Euroimmun AG), Rickettsia conorii IgG IFA Kit
(Fuller Laboratories, Fullerton, CA), and Rickettsia typhi IgG
IFA Kit (Fuller Laboratories) were used. As secondary an-
tibody fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated poly-
clonal rabbit anti-mouse IgG was used (dilution 1:20; Dako,
Glostrup, Denmark) together with Evans Blue counter-
staining (BioMerieux, Marcy l’Etoile, France). Slides were
read on a fluorescent microscope Eclipse 50i (Nikon Instru-
ments Inc., Japan) by two independent examiners.
Nucleic acid isolation
Each sample (total n = 194) was homogenized in cell cul-
ture medium (minimum essential medium [MEM] +
GlutaMAX; Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA)
using the FastPrep 24 (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA).
Nucleic acids were extracted using the QIAamp Viral
RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following manu-
facturer’s instructions.
Detection and phylogenetic analysis of hantaviral RNA
A total of 94 heart and 31 lung samples were screened for
hantaviruses by a reverse transcription polymerase chain re-
action (RT-PCR) targeting the partial S-segment of PUUV,
DOBV, and TULV (Table 1) as described previously (Ess-
             2006). The remaining 44 lung samples (Apodemus
flavicollis, n = 28; Myodes glareolus, n = 16) from Žutica had
been screened and published before (             2012). For
amplification of almost complete S-segment sequences of
DOBV, new primer pairs were designed (Table 1). For
PUUV, previously published primers (               2011)
were used (Table 1). Partial M-segments of PUUV and DOBV
were gained from screening-positive heart samples using

published primer pairs (                 2000,                 
2011) (Table 1). All S- and M-segment sequences were sub-
mitted to GenBank (accession no.     6589-635).
The phylogeny was inferred using the maximum likeli-
hood method based on the Tamura–Nei model implemented
in MEGA5 software (              2011) with additional
sequences from GenBank.
Detection of Rickettsia spp. DNA
Real-time screening PCR targeting citrate synthase gene
(gltA) was performed for all samples (n = 194) using Light-
Cycler FastStart DNA Master HybProbe (Roche Applied
Science, Indianapolis, IN) on a LightCycler 1.5 instrument
(Roche) as published previously (Wö            2008,      
       2011). A conventional PCR targeting the partial outer
membrane protein B gene (ompB) was performed to deter-
mine the Rickettsia species in positive samples as described
(Roux and Raoult 2000).
Detection of TBEV RNA
Real-time RT-PCR targeting a fragment of the 3¢ noncoding
region of the TBEV was performed for all samples (n = 194)
using QuantiTect Virus RT-PCR-Kit System (Qiagen) on a
Stratagene Mx3000P (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA)
following a published protocol (Schwaiger and Cassinotti
2003). Langat virus RNA served as a positive control.
Rodent species determination
Rodent species were determined morphologically and
confirmed genetically on rodents from Gerovo (n = 94) and
Apodemus mice from Žutica (n = 17) using PCR targeting the
mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (mt-Cytb) (         
       2003,                 2006). Part of mt-Cytb sequences
were submitted to GenBank (accession no.     6636-655).
Results
A total of 194 heart, lung, and kidney samples of 170 rodents
from two localities in Croatia were analyzed (Table 2). At
Žutica (n = 76), 15 A. flavicollis and two A. agrarius were ge-
netically identified, genetic determination of 28 A. flavicollis
was done before by              (2012), and 31 M. glareolus
were morphologically identified. From Gerovo (n = 94), 72
A. flavicollis and 22 M. glareolus were genetically confirmed.
Hantaviruses
Specific antibodies to hantaviruses were found in 24/94
(25.5%) investigated heart transudates from Gerovo (Table
2). Seventeen of these originated from A. flavicollis and seven
from M. glareolus. Fewer animals from Gerovo, 20/94
(21.3%), were positive by RT-PCR, all of which were posi-
tive by IIFT; 7/22 (31.8%) M. glareolus revealed PUUV and
13/72 (18.1%) A. flavicollis were DOBV positive. From
Žutica, nine of 31 (29.0%) rodents were positive by RT-PCR,
including one of 15 (6.7%) M. glareolus (PUUV) and eight of
14 (57.1%) A. flavicollis (Table 2). In five of seven PUUV
positives from Gerovo, almost complete S-segment sequences
(1766 base pairs, nucleotides 52–1830) were recovered
showing 98.4–100% similarity to each other, whereas deduced
amino acid sequences were 98.1–100% similar. The PUUV
sequence obtained from Žutica was 345 base pairs (nucleotides

714–1058) due to unsuccessful amplification of further
S-segment sequences by additional RT-PCRs and shared 94.2–
95.5% similarity to the sequences from Gerovo, while the
deduced amino acid sequences were 97.3–98.2% similar.
Therefore, two phylogenetic trees were constructed, one for
the almost complete S-segment sequences from Gerovo and
other European PUUV strains (nucleotides 52–1674) and the
second comparing partial sequences from Gerovo, Žutica and
other strains (nucleotides 714–1058). The phylogenetic anal-
ysis for the almost complete S-segment (Fig. 2) revealed eight
PUUV lineages. The Alpe-Adrian PUUV lineage formed a
sister group to the Central European lineage. Within the Alpe-
Adrian lineage, the subgroup A, with good bootstrap support,
included only sequences from Gerovo that subdivided into
distinct inferior branches. The subgroup B included sequences
of previously described PUUV strains from Austria, Hungary,
and the Balkans. The phylogenetic analysis for a partial
S-segment of 345 nucleotides (with the sequences in this
analysis adjusted to the same length; Fig. 2, inset) revealed that
PUUV sequences from Gerovo and Žutica lay within two
separate subgroups within the Alpe-Adrian lineage. Subgroup
A only included the sequences from Gerovo, whereas sub-
group B included the sequence from Žutica and sequences of
previously described PUUV strains from Austria, Hungary,
and the Balkans.
Almost complete S-segment sequences (1567 base pairs,
nucleotides 23–1677) were gained in seven of 13 DOBV
positive samples from Gerovo and revealed 98.7–100%
similarity among themselves, whereas deduced amino acid
sequences showed 96.6–100% similarity. In four of eight
DOBV positive samples from Žutica, almost complete S-
segment sequences (1568 base pairs) were obtained showing
a 100% similarity among each other, and the similarity to
sequences from Gerovo was 96.6–96.8%. Interestingly, the
sequences from Gerovo have one less nucleotide (nucleotide
1333) in the noncoding region compared to sequences from
Žutica and sequences from Greece or Slovakia. The phylo-
genetic analysis for the almost complete DOBV S-segment
revealed four lineages (nucleotides 23–1590; Fig. 3). The
phylogenetic analysis of DOBV showed that the sequences
from Gerovo and Žutica were situated in three well-supported
subgroups A–C within genotype Dobrava. Subgroup A
comprised sequences from Gerovo that subdivide into infe-
rior branches. Subgroup B included one sequence from
Gerovo together with sequences from Slovenian genotype
Dobrava strains. This sequence from Gerovo had more nu-
cleotide differences (1.3%) compared to other sequences
from Gerovo. Subgroup C represented sequences from Žutica
together with sequences of previously described genotype
Dobrava strains from Greece and Slovakia.
Partial M-segment sequences of PUUV and DOBV were
obtained from rodents trapped at Gerovo. The seven PUUV
M-segment sequences of 850 base pairs (nucleotides 2161–
3010) had 99.4–100% similarity to each other, whereas de-
duced amino acid sequences were 95.5–100% identical. The
gained 11 DOBV M-segment sequences of 520 base pairs
(nucleotides 1489–2008) bore 98–100% resemblance to one
another, whereas deduced amino acid sequences showed
93.9–100% identity. The phylogenetic analysis of PUUV and
DOBV M-segment sequences for the partial correspond-
ing region is in line with the phylogenetic analysis of the
S-segment sequences but is not shown due to insufficient
bootstrap support in the branches.
TBEV
All processed samples were negative for TBEV by IIFT

controls on all IIFT slides and in real-time RT-PCR reactions
were accurate.
Rickettsia spp.
Only animals from Gerovo were positive for Rickettsia spp.
Four out of 94 (4.3%, from two M. glareolus and two A. fla-
vicollis) heart transudates showed serological evidence of re-
activity with SFG rickettsiae (Table 2). Additionally, another
three individuals (three of 94, 3.2%) from Gerovo (one
M. glareolus, two A. flavicollis) were positive for Rickettsia
spp. by gltA real-time PCR. Species determination could not be
confirmed by ompB PCR due to lesser sensitivity of the con-
ventional PCR.
Multiple infections
All four samples reactive for antibodies against Rickettsia
spp. were also positive for hantavirus antibodies and hanta-
virus RNA (two PUUV and two DOBV positive) (data not
shown). Additionally, one M. glareolus from Gerovo re-
vealed simultaneous detection of rickettsial DNA and PUUV
RNA (data not shown).
Discussion
The high percentage (25.5% by IIFT, 23.2% by RT-PCR)
of hantavirus-positive rodents found in this study is in ac-
cordance with previous studies on hantaviruses in Croatia
(              2005,              2012) and other countries
(Avsic-              2000,                 2006,       
       2012), although the sampling was performed in dif-
ferent years/seasons and in nonepidemic periods in Croatia.
Overall, 21.3% of the rodents from Gerovo and 29.0% of the
animals from Žutica were positive. In 2008, 13 cases of
HFRS were recorded from the mountainous area of Gorski
kotar (Institute of Public Health of the Primorsko-goranska
county) where Gerovo is situated. Moreover, Gerovo is ad-
jacent to Slovenia, where a higher number of human infec-
tions had been noticed in 2008 (              2011). As
indicated by Borcić        (1991), the area of Gorski kotar can
be considered as HFRS endemic with a seroprevalence of
4.4% in the human population. Compared to the ser-
oprevalence (25.5%) measured in rodent transudates from
mountainous Gerovo, 43% of the rodents from lowland Žu-
tica reacted seropositive in another study (             2012).

For Žutica, human seroprevalence data regarding hantavirus
infections were not investigated so far.
The samples available from Gerovo unfortunately only
comprised heart tissue. Due to lower detection rates of han-
tavirus RNA in heart specimens in other studies or depending
on the molecular method used (                2006,      
       2009), these results may not allow definite conclusions
on hantavirus prevalence in Gerovo. They rather suggest that
the percentage of hantavirus positives would be even higher if
other tissue (e.g., lung) had been used (                2006).
Phylogenetic analyses of partial S- and M-segments re-
vealed that the sequences from Gerovo and Žutica formed
two well-supported distinct genetic subclusters in Croatian
PUUV and DOBV. Separation into genetic geographic
clusters where the genetic distances of DOBV and PUUV
strains increase with increasing geographical separation has
been described (Avsic-              2000,                
2012). The genetic distance between virus sequences ob-
tained from mountainous Gerovo and lowland Žutica was
demonstrated by the two subclusters within PUUV and
FIG. 3. Phylogenetic analysis of the almost complete Dobrava–Belgrade virus (DOBV) S-segment (corresponding to
nucleotides 23–1590 of the reference strain, accession no. NC_005233) using the maximum likelihood method based on the
Tamura–Nei model. Only bootstrap values > 70%, calculated from 1000 replicates, are shown at the tree branches. DOBV
genotypes within the tree were termed according to the subdivision of DOBV suggested by               (2013).

DOBV and might be explained by geographical barriers
(mountainous area between the two localities) that prevent
the spreading of rodents and virus. Gerovo lies within the
Dinarides (Dinaric Alps) that form a mountain chain in
a northeast–southwest direction. Žutica is located in the
Panonic-peripanonic area in a Sava river valley. The two sites
are approximatly 200 km apart. The two strains of PUUV and
DOBV could also suggest that there were two routes of rodent
postglacial colonization dispersing from Balkan Peninsula re-
fugia for both Myodes and Apodemus rodents, respectively
(Bilton etal. 1998,                2004). A similar situation has
been postulated in Fennoscandia (                 2000) for
bankvolepopulations and PUUV. Further studies are neededto
discriminate whether rodent host genetic lines at our study sites
are different. Moreover, data from other geographic areas in
Croatia are needed to prove this hypothesis.
To date, there are no available data about the presence of
rickettsiae in wild rodents from Croatia and only limited data
are available about Rickettsia spp. in small rodents worldwide
(             2011, Dantas-              2012). In our study,
4.2% of the rodents (two A. flavicollis, two M. glareolus) from
Gerovo revealed anti-Rickettsia antibodies. From Germany,
29.3% of wild rodents were positive for anti-Rickettsia anti-
bodies (             2011). Three out of 170 (1.8%) rodents in
our study were positive for Rickettsia DNA by real-time PCR,
with only hearts being positive. In contrast, only ear tissue
(5.8%) and spleen samples (5.2%) were positive in other
studies (           2006,              2011). The low per-
centage of Rickettsia spp.–positive samples in the present study
might be explained by the suboptimal tissue choice. However,
it might also suggest that both sampling sites are within areas of
low Rickettsia spp. circulation, which coincides with low ser-
oprevalence in humans in continental (              2011)
compared to coastal Croatia (Punda-Polić        2003).
None of the samples examined tested positive for TBEV
RNA or antibodies against TBEV. The real-time RT-PCR
used is specific for all Western subtypes of TBEV strains
published so far (Schwaiger and Cassinotti 2003, Essbauer,
unpublished data). Although there are reports about TBEV
detected in rodents in Europe (              2011,            
2012), either none of the captured rodents from this study
were infected with TBEV or viral infection could not be
demonstrated. TBEV RNA in heart tissue is detectable only
at late days postinfection (              2011). Furthermore,
TBE natural foci seem to be very focal (Kup
          2010)
and therefore TBE may be nonexistent in the areas tested,
which might have hampered TBEV detection in this study
with animals of unknown infection status.
Although one might expect simultaneous infections with
the pathogens investigated in this study, only one M. glareolus
from Gerovo was found harboring both Rickettsia DNA and
PUUV RNA. Comparable studies showed, by proving etiolog-
ical agents, dual infections of PUUV and Leptospira (      
       2006) and even triple infections with hantaviruses, Lep-
tospira, and Babesia in Croatian rodents (             2012).
Conclusions
Herein we have presented data on the occurrence and prev-
alence of three zoonotic pathogens in wild rodents from moun-
tainous and lowland Croatia. Overall, nearly 30% of rodents
showed evidence of hantavirus infection. The study areas con-
stitute HFRS risk areas due to the high percentage of hantavirus-
positive rodents. Almost complete hantavirus S-segment
sequences were gained for PUUV from a mountainous region
and DOBV from both study sites. Within the phylogenetic trees,
the sequences from the two sites formed well-supported sub-
groups revealing two variants in Croatian PUUV and DOBV for
S- and M-segment with the sequences from the mountainous
locality separating into distinct subgroups. To our knowledge,
this is the first description of the detection of Rickettsia spp. in
Croatian rodents. Our data also demonstrate that Myodes carry
and may transmit different zoonotic agents (Rickettsia spp. and
PUUV). Regarding TBEV, further investigations are needed to
clarify whether the virus is present at the study sites. Because
Gerovo and Žutica are situated near protected recreational areas
with high numbers of annual visitors, the current and future data
will contribute to risk assessment and prevention strategies.
