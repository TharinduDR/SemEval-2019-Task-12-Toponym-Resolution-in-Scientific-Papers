INTRODUCTION
Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV; family Toga-
viridae, genus Alphavirus) is the most virulent of the arthro-
pod-borne viruses (arboviruses) in the United States. The
virus is found primarily along the Atlantic Seaboard and
the Gulf Coast states, although it is also found as far west as
the Great Lakes region. Additional lineages of the virus are
found in many parts of Central and South America.1,2
In the
northeastern United States, the primary vector responsible for
maintaining the enzootic cycle of the virus is the ornithophilic
mosquito Culiseta melanura,3,4
although other mosquito spe-
cies may be responsible for enzootic maintenance in the south
central United States.5,6
Enzootic cycles are often located in
hardwood swamp habitats, where vector and avian hosts are
found.There are also numerous species of bridge vectors with
catholic feeding patterns important in epizootic transmission
of the virus to humans, horses, and other mammals, which are
generally considered dead end hosts for the virus.7,8
In the United States, Florida is the state with the most
reported neuroinvasive human cases of EEEV.9
In Florida,
unlike in the rest of the United States, EEEV has been found
to circulate throughout the year.10
Because of this stable
transmission cycle of EEEV in Florida, some investigators
have proposed that Florida may serve as a reservoir from
which EEEV is introduced periodically into Connecticut,
New Hampshire, and New York in the northeastern United
States, areas in which virus is endemic,11–14
through migration
of infected birds.
Phylogenetic analyses of EEEV have been performed to
study the overall evolutionary history of North American
strains, and to study transmission, localized perpetuation, and
movement of the virus in selected regions of the northeast-
ern United States.11,14
However an in depth study of the trans-
mission and evolutionary history of EEEV in Florida has not
been reported.
The Florida Department of Health Bureau of Laboratories
(BOL), in Tampa has a long history of statewide arbovirus
surveillance, including EEEV, St. Louis encephalitis virus,
highlands J virus, and more recently West Nile virus (WNV).
The BOL coordinates an extensive sentinel chicken program
throughout most of Florida, screens veterinary and wild bird
serum samples for arboviruses, and tests mosquito pools from
local mosquito control districts. As a result of these efforts,
numerous isolations/detections of EEEV have been made by
the BOL from many counties across the state dating from the
late 1980s.
To study the transmission and evolutionary history of
EEEV in Florida, 24 EEEV isolates were chosen for gene
sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. Strains were chosen
from four geographically distinct regions of the state and from
different years. These selection criteria enabled an examina-
tion of the level of the genetic diversity existing between geo-
graphic regions of the state and over a temporal scale of two
decades.These data were compared with similar data collected
from EEEV isolates from other states to test the hypothesis
that Florida might serve as a reservoir for the introduction of
EEEV to other regions of the United States.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Virus isolation. The EEEV isolates from Florida were pro-
vided by the Florida Department of Health BOL in Tampa.
Collection dates of these specimens ranged from 1986 through
2008. Isolates were derived from nine counties and from a
variety of sources including avian, mammalian, and insect
hosts. All virus isolates from Florida were previously cul-
tured in either cell culture or suckling mouse brain and had
a history of one or two such passages. Samples from Alabama
were collected in 2003 at an EEEV-endemic site located in
the Tuskegee National Forest in east central Alabama.6,11–14
Collection details on all isolates used in this study are shown
in Table 1.
Alabama isolates, all of which were derived from mos-
quito pools, were positive for EEEV by reverse transcription–
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), but had not been con-
firmed by culture. Homogenates from these positive pools had
been prepared in BA-1 tissue culture medium as described,5
and had been stored at –80°C. To culture these viruses,
stored homogenates (approximately 1 mL) were thawed
at 37°C and 1 mL of diluent (1× Hanks’ minimal essential

Abstract. Florida has the highest degree of endemicity for eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) of any state in
the United States and is the only state with year-round transmission of EEEV.To further understand the viral population
dynamics in Florida, the genome sequence of six EEEV isolates from central Florida were determined. These data were
used to identify the most polymorphic regions of the EEEV genome from viruses isolated in Florida. The sequence of
these polymorphic regions was then determined for 18 additional Florida isolates collected in four geographically distinct
regions over a 20-year period. Phylogenetic analyses of these data suggested a rough temporal association of the Florida
isolates, but no clustering by region or by source of the isolate. Some clustering of northeastern isolates with Florida iso-
lates was seen, providing support for the hypothesis that Florida serves as a reservoir for the periodic introduction of
EEEV into the northeastern United States.

fuged at 4°C for 4 minutes at 13,000 × g, and the supernatant
was filtered through a sterile 0.2-μm filter before inocula-
tion into individual T-25 flasks of confluent Vero cell cultures.
Flasks were incubated for 1 hour at 37°C, with gentle rock-
ing every 15 minutes. After the incubation for 1 hour, 9 mL
of maintenance media (1× Earle’s minimal essential medium,
2% fetal bovine serum, 200 U/mL penicillin, 200 μg/mL strep-
tomycin, 2.5 μg/mL amphotericin B) were added to each flask,
Cells were monitored daily for a cytopathic effect. If a cyto-
pathic effect (CPE) was observed, the culture was confirmed
as containing EEEV by RT-PCR.
RNA extraction, RT-PCR, and sequencing. RNA was iso-
lated from cell culture or tissue samples using the QIAmp
Viral RNA kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Viral RNA was
reverse transcribed by using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) following the manufacture’s recom-
mendations, and reaction conditions using the random oligo
and oligo dT primers in the kit and 3 μL of extracted RNA
template.
EEEV cDNA was then amplified by PCR in 14 reactions
to generate nearly complete genomes; primer sequences used
in these reactions are available upon request. To amplify the
genomic segments, 2 μL from each cDNA reaction was added
to 25 μL PCR master mixture containing 1× PCR buffer, 0.2
mM dNTPs, 0.5 μM of each primer, and 2.0 units Taq DNA
polymerase. Amplification was performed as follows: 1 cycle
at 95°C for 4 minutes; 40 cycles at 95°C for 30 seconds, 55°C
for 30 seconds, and 72°C for 1 minute and 20 seconds; and 1
cycle 72°C for 7 minutes. Amplification products were ana-
lyzed by gel electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel. DNA from
bands of the appropriate size were cleaned with the QIAquick
PCR purification kit (Qiagen), and sequences determined by
using a commercial DNA sequencing service (Genewiz, South
Plainfield, NJ).
To amplify smaller segments of viral genomes, the same
protocol was used as for amplifying the 14 segments used
to determine the sequence of the complete genomes, except
for modifications in the cycling conditions. The amplification
cycling conditions consisted of 1 cycle at 95°C for 4 minutes;
35 cycles at 95°C for 20 seconds, 55°C for 30 seconds,
and 72°C for 1 minute; and 1 cycle at 72°C for 7 minutes.
The primer sequences used to amplify the pieces from the
nonstructural genes were EEEnsp1 373c 5′-CGCTGAGA
CACCCTCGTTAT-3′ with EEEnsp 11268nc 5′-GAGTTTTG
AAAGCCCAGCAG-3′; EEEnsp2 2064c 5′- TAGTAGACCC

GCAAGAAGCAAACG-3′ with EEEnsp3 5646nc 5′-TCGTA
CCGTCAATTCGAGTG-3′.The sequences for the structural
region were obtained by using primers developed for genomic
sequencing.
Sequence analyses. EEEV genomes were constructed from
data derived from the 14 overlapping segments amplified as
described above, by using the SeqMan module of Lasergene
(DNAstar, Madison, WI). The final contigs had at least two-
fold coverage in all positions. The six genomes were aligned
by using CLUSTAL W in MacVector (MacVector Inc., Cary,
NC) and analyzed manually for location of parsimony infor-
mative sites. The alignment was then analyzed for sequence
diversity by using the software program DnaSP.15

PHYLOGENY OF EEEV ISOLATES FROM FLORIDA
program to conduct an exhaustive analysis, the heuristic algo-
rithm was used. Statistical support for all groupings was evalu-
ated by reanalysis of 1,000 synthetic bootstrap datasets.
The jModelTest17,18
was used to predict the best parameters
in reconstructing Bayesian trees. It was also used to set the
five substitution schemes, with the other values set as default
(use base frequencies, rate variation with four categories),
and ML-optimized base tree for likelihood calculations. The
jModelTest predicted that the general time reversible plus
proportion of invariant sites plus discretized gamma distribu-
tion (GTR + I + G) evolutionary model would be the best
for the set of sequences in the first two Bayesian phylogenies
analyzing the relationships among all Florida isolates whose
sequence was determined.
The MrBayes software package19,20
was then used to cal-
culate the phylogenetic tree. The GTR + G + I evolutionary
model was used and the program was set to run for 1,000,000
generations with sampling every 1,000 generations. The first
25% (250) of sampled trees were discarded as burn-in. The
average standard deviation of split frequencies at the end of
the run was 0.01. The potential scale reduction factor for all
parameters at the end of the run was 1.0 ± 0.004. For the tree
including isolates from the northeastern United States, the
methods were exactly the same as used, except that jModelT-
est predicted the best fitting model as GTR + I in both cases.
This model was subsequently used on both phylogenetic recon-
structions.The potential scale reduction factor on this tree was
1.00 ± 0.002, and the final SD of split frequencies was 0.01.
RESULTS
On the basis of an analysis of the records of EEEV iso-
lates maintained by the Florida Department of Health
Virology Laboratory, four regions were selected from which
viral isolates for genomic sequence analysis were identified
(Figure 1). These regions included the Western Panhandle,
north central, east central, and southeastern regions of the
state.These regions were selected because they are geographi-
cally distinct and represent different ecological biotomes.With
the exception of the southeastern region of Florida, multiple
archived viral samples collected over a relatively long period
were available. In addition to these four regions in Florida,
three isolates of EEEV from pools of mosquitoes collected
at a well-characterized study site in the Tuskegee National
Forest5,21,22
were included in the study. Descriptions of these
isolates are shown in Table 1.
Initially,nucleic acid sequences of six isolates from Region 3
were determined. The sequence data covered almost the
entire genome, encompassing all but the first 48 nucleotides
from the 5′ untranslated region and all but the last 7 nucle-
otides from the poly-A tail, when compared with the com-
plete NJ/60 genome sequence. These data were subjected to
phylogenetic analysis by using maximum parsimony methods
(Figure 2). This initial phylogeny supported the division of
these isolates into two distinct clades separated by time, with
all strains from the 1990s in one clade and remaining isolates
from the 2000s in a separate clade. In contrast, no phylogenic
grouping of isolates by host class (avian, equine, or mosquito)
was found (Figure 2).
Sequence data from the six isolates were then aligned and
the areas of greatest sequence diversity in the genomes were
determined by using a sliding window with a window size of
300 nucleotides and a step size of 50 nucleotides (Figure 3).

virus genomic sequences of isolates from Volusia County, Florida

tributed among the six taxa.An unrooted phylogeny was prepared by
using the exhaustive search algorithm in the PAUP program package.
This analysis returned one most parsimonious tree.The phylogeny has
a consistency index of 0.98. Numbers on the figure indicate the per-
centage of times the grouping distal to the number were supported in

712 WHITE AND OTHERS
This information, along with the location of the parsimony
informative sites, were used to select five segments of the
genome with the greatest diversity and phylogenetically infor-
mative positions to target in the subsequent analysis of the
additional isolates listed in Table 1. Overall, these segments
covered 4,384 nucleotides, representing 37% of the total
EEEV genome (Figure 3). In addition, to compare the Florida
isolates with other EEEV sequences available in GenBank,
the complete sequence of the structural polyprotein gene was
also determined for each isolate shown in Table 1. This struc-
tural sequence covered 3,729 nucleotides, representing 32% of
the EEEV genome (Figure 3).
Sequence data derived from these selected regions were
then used to construct two Bayesian phylogenetic trees by
using the parameters described in the Materials and Methods.
The first of these trees (Figure 4) used the concatenated seg-
ments from the variable regions of the nonstructural protein 1
(NSP1), NSP2, NSP3, capsid and envelope 1 genes shown
in Figure 3, and the second phylogeny was prepared by
using the data derived from the structural polyprotein gene
(Figure 5). The two phylogenies generally agreed with one
another, although there were some minor differences in the
observed topologies. For example, the phylogeny prepared
from the concatenated data grouped strains 2002 aR1-56 and
2003 eR3-40 together with a probability of 0.94 (Figure 4).
In the tree derived from the polyprotein structural gene
sequence, strains 2003 eR3-40 and 2003 eR3-3 are grouped
together with a probability of 0.68, and isolate 2002 aR1-56
was grouped by itself as a polytomy (Figure 5). However, both
analyses supported the existence of two major clades, with one
clade containing three isolates obtained from the 1990s and an
isolate from 2005, and the second clade contained all of the
remaining 13 Florida isolates from 2001–2008, together with
all of the Alabama isolates and three Florida isolates from the
1990s (Figures 4 and 5). The single Florida isolate obtained
from the 1980s was distinct from any of the later isolates in
both phylogenies (Figures 4 and 5).
Both phylogenies, when considered together, generally
grouped isolates from the same region and collection year
together,althoughthereweresomeexceptionstothisgrouping.
There were two pairs of isolates examined that were derived
from the same region and same year (pairs 2003 eR3-3 +
2003 eR3-40 and 2005 mR3-4 + 2005 mR3-39). The first of
these was monophyletic in the structural phylogeny but not the
concatentated gene phylogeny, and the second pair was mono-
phyletic on both phylogenies. Similarly, there were two sets of
isolates containing three isolates each that were derived from
the same region and year (1992 aR3-1 + 1992 mR3-7 + 1992
aR3-52 and 2003 mAL-62 + 2003 mAL-63 + 2003 mAL-64).
In both of these three isolate groups, both phylogenies iden-
tified pairs of isolates that were monophyetic, and classified
the remaining isolate as distinct from the monophyletic pair
(Figures 4 and 5). Neither phylogeny supported the grouping
of isolates by either host type or geographic region.
Recently, published studies based upon analyses of the
structural genes have proposed the hypothesis that EEEV foci
in the northeastern United States arise from periodic impor-
tations of the virus from Florida.11,14
To test this hypothesis,
published structural gene sequences from 18 EEEV isolates
obtained from regions outside Florida were analyzed with
structural gene data obtained from the Florida isolates. The
sequences from the GenBank isolates included in this analy-
sis are shown in Table 2. Of these isolates, 12 contained the
full structural polyprotein gene sequence. These isolates var-
ied greatly in when they were isolated and where they orig-
inated. To compare more sequences from a more tightly
temporally and spatially distributed group, data from six addi-
tional isolates available on GenBank from the northeast-
ern United States were also analyzed. However, these latter
sequences included only portions of the structural polyprotein
gene (Figure 3). Thus, this analysis was limited to the 1,559
nucleotides for which data were available from all isolates.
The resulting phylogeny contained more polytomies among
the Florida isolates than did the phylogeny prepared using the
entire structural gene sequences, as would be expected consid-
ering the more limited dataset analyzed.
Despite this finding, the resulting phylogeny supported a
rough temporal association of the isolates from the north-
eastern United States and Florida (Figure 6). Most isolates
obtained in the first decade of the 21st century from outside
Florida were included in the large clade containing most of the
2001–2008 Florida isolates shown in Figures 4 and 5 (Figure 6).
Similarly, isolate CT 1996 grouped with the Florida isolates
1986 eR2-10 and FL 1993-939 (Figure 3).Within the large clade
containing most isolates from Florida from 2001–2008, some
evidence of association between specific Florida isolates and
those collected elsewhere was also evident. For example, CT
2003-13243 was contained within clade that included a number
of Florida isolates collected from 2001–2005 (Figure 6).
DISCUSSION
Our data support the conclusion that EEEV isolates from
Florida generally cluster by year of isolation. For example, the
oldest Florida isolate examined in the study (1986 eR2-10)

was found to be distinct from all of the other Florida isolates
from the 1990s and 2000s. Furthermore, analysis supported
the existence of two major clades into which the other Florida
isolates grouped. The smaller of these clades consisted pri-
marily of Florida isolates from the 1990s, but also included a
single isolate from 2005. The larger clade consisted primarily
of isolates from the 2000s, although it also included three iso-
lates from 1992. In contrast, the data failed to show any evi-
dence for spatial clustering of EEEV of the Florida isolates.
Such spatial clustering would have been expected if EEEV
transmission were localized in isolated foci in the different
regions of the state. Some of the most closely related virus
isolates were from widely separated regions (e.g., 2001 aR2-
35 and 2001 aR4-12). These data suggest that the virus is not
geographically isolated in Florida and that it is therefore
capable of disseminating across fairly large distances in the
state. Similarly, the data also did not support any evolutionary
grouping of viral isolates based upon the source from which
the virus was isolated; viral isolates from mosquitoes, birds, or
equine sources did not group together. These data therefore
do not support the hypothesis of distinct virus isolates circu-
lating in different host species in Florida, as has been recently
reported in studies of EEEV in South America.23
Although phylogenies developed from the data tended to
group isolates obtained from the same period together, they
did not provide any evidence for a progressive temporal evolu-
tion of the virus, as is seen with influenza, One potential expla-
nation for this finding is that the limited degree of diversity

in the virus provided insufficient phylogenetically informative
data to detect such an orderly temporal evolutionary pattern.
However, the phylogenies reported appear relatively robust;
both datasets produced nearly identical phylogenies in which
major groupings received strong statistical support, suggest-
ing the data were informative enough to perform an accu-
rate phylogenic analysis. However, the relatively short branch
lengths observed underscores the overall high degree of
sequence conservation previously reported in NorthAmerican
EEEV.11–14
This lack of sequence diversity reflects the conserved

PHYLOGENY OF EEEV ISOLATES FROM FLORIDA
evolutionary history of the virus. It has been suggested that
one reason for the high degree of sequence conservation in
EEEV may relate to its need to infect multiple hosts with dif-
ferent physiologies.24,25
Mutations in many different positions
might affect the ability of the virus to efficiently infect one of
these diverse hosts, which would limit the genetic variability
seen in naturally circulating virus populations.
Alternative explanations for the lack of a clear temporal
evolutionary pattern may relate to the biology of the virus
in Florida. First, unlike the pattern seen in the northeastern
United States, EEEV is stably endemic, with year round trans-
mission in Florida. Such a pattern might lead to the produc-
tion of a genetically diverse virus population, which would
in turn lead to many strains co-circulating simultaneously as
competing clusters of viruses.26
Stochastic processes driven
by local conditions could then lead to the predominance of
a particular viral type during a given year. Second, EEEV is
generally a non-fatal viral infection of the passerine birds of
North America, with infection of these species leading to long-
term immunity.27
This type of infection would not favor a grad-
ual temporal evolution of the virus through antigenic drift,
such as is seen with human influenza A virus, where the host
retains partial immunity to future influenza strains. Rather, a
strong level of immunity in the avian host population would
lead to a transmission pattern more similar to that seen with
human measles, where stochastic events give rise to certain
dominant strains that then tend to remain dominant for a
given period.28
In human measles, this transmission pattern
leads to a pattern similar to what is seen in our study, where
little evidence of an orderly evolution of the virus over time
can be detected.
The phylogenetic pattern of Florida viral isolates dif-
fers from that shown in recent studies of isolates from the
northeastern United States. Those studies have demon-
strated that in the northeastern United States, EEEV tends
to occur in successive waves of genetically fairly uniform
virus populations that circulate for a number of years and
then disappear, only to be replaced by another population
of nearly genetically identical viruses.11,14
It has been sug-
gested that this pattern is the result of periodic introduc-
tion of EEEV into the northeastern United States, resulting
in establishment of foci that remain active for a few years
before dying out and being replaced by a subsequent viral
introduction.11
It has been further hypothesized that Florida might be the
source of these viral introductions to the northeastern United
States.14
Our data provide some support for this hypothesis.
For example, the Connecticut isolate CT-2003-13243 grouped
with Florida isolates from 2001–2005, suggesting that the CT
2003–2004 clade previously identified may have arisen by
an introduction from a Florida viral reservoir. Similarly, as
reported, the CT 310-96 isolate (CT 1996 in Figure 6) grouped
with the FL 1993-93911
isolate, and was even more closely
related to the FL 1986 mR2-10 isolate reported, supporting
the hypothesis of a Florida origin. Finally, the three isolates
from Alabama grouped with two Florida isolates, suggest-
ing that the Alabama virus might also have been introduced
from Florida. Two of the AL isolates (2003 mAL-63 and 2003
mAL-64) also grouped with isolates from Tennessee and
Georgia, indicating that EEEV may be also be introduced
into the southeastern United States from a Florida reservoir.
However, although the data in general support a relation-
ship between the Florida isolates and those obtained from
elsewhere, in many cases it is not possible to deduce a direct
relationship between a particular Florida isolate and those
collected outside Florida because of the presence of polyto-
mies and poor statistical support for some of the direct pair-
ings present in the phylogeny. However, it appears that the
stable endemic transmission pattern of EEEV in Florida may
have resulted in the development of a highly diverse virus
population, and it is thus possible that these isolates arose
from a Florida progenitor strain that has not yet been char-
acterized. Additional studies comparing more isolates from
Florida to those from the northeastern United States may be
useful in resolving this issue.
The phylogenetic relationships developed to date all sup-
port the hypothesis that Florida serves as the reservoir from
which EEEV is periodically introduced into the northeast-
ern United States. However, it is also possible for viruses that
have undergone isolated evolution in the northeastern United
States to migrate south and become established in Florida,
further increasing viral diversity in this state.Arbovirus migra-
tion has already been documented to occur from the north-
eastern United States to Florida with the introduction of
WNV to New York in 1999 and the subsequent appearance of
the virus to Florida in 2001.
Our data suggest that a major switch in viral type occurred
in the late 1990s or early 2000s. It is interesting to note that
this finding corresponds to the period when WNV was first
detected in Florida in 2001.29
Previous studies have suggested
that introduction of WNV resulted in dramatic changes in
the transmission of St. Louis encephalitis virus in Florida
and elsewhere.30,31
It is therefore possible that the introduc-
tion of WNV might have also affected the ecology of EEEV
transmission in Florida, resulting in a shift in the predominant
circulating viral type. Such a change might have resulted from
indirect effects of WNV on the enzootic passerine bird reser-
voir for EEEV, or other changes in the transmission dynamics

Figure 6. Bayesian analysis of eastern equine encephalitis virus isolates from Florida and other locations in the United States. Bayesian phy-
logenies were prepared by using the MrBayes program package,20
as described in the Materials and Methods. Phylogenies were rooted by using
the      and Ten Broeck sequences. Branch lengths are proportional to distance (the number of nucleotide changes), and the distance scale
at the bottom of the tree represents the number of expected substitutions per site. Values indicate the probability for each partition or clade in
the tree.

PHYLOGENY OF EEEV ISOLATES FROM FLORIDA
of EEEV resulting from the introduction of another arbovirus
into what has been a previously stable transmission system for
EEEV. Laboratory and modeling studies examining the trans-
mission dynamics of EEEV in the presence and absence of
WNV would be useful in testing this hypothesis.
