Abstract
Background: Eurasian-origin and intercontinental reassortant highly pathogenic (HP) influenza A viruses (IAVs) were
first detected in North America in wild, captive, and domestic birds during November–December 2014. Detections
of HP viruses in wild birds in the contiguous United States and southern Canadian provinces continued into winter
and spring of 2015 raising concerns that migratory birds could potentially disperse viruses to more northerly breeding
areas where they could be maintained to eventually seed future poultry outbreaks.
Results: We sampled 1,129 wild birds on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, Alaska, one of the largest breeding areas for
waterfowl in North America, during spring and summer of 2015 to test for Eurasian lineage and intercontinental
reassortant HP H5 IAVs and potential progeny viruses. We did not detect HP IAVs in our sample collection from
western Alaska; however, we isolated five low pathogenic (LP) viruses. Four isolates were of the H6N1 (n = 2), H6N2,
and H9N2 combined subtypes whereas the fifth isolate was a mixed infection that included H3 and N7 gene
segments. Genetic characterization of these five LP IAVs isolated from cackling (Branta hutchinsii; n = 2) and greater
white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons; n = 3), revealed three viral gene segments sharing high nucleotide identity with
HP H5 viruses recently detected in North America. Additionally, one of the five isolates was comprised of multiple
Eurasian lineage gene segments.
Conclusions: Our results did not provide direct evidence for circulation of HP IAVs in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta
region of Alaska during spring and summer of 2015. Prevalence and genetic characteristics of LP IAVs during the
sampling period are concordant with previous findings of relatively low viral prevalence in geese during spring,
non-detection of IAVs in geese during summer, and evidence for intercontinental exchange of viruses in western
Alaska.

Background
In November–December 2014, highly pathogenic (HP)
H5 influenza A viruses (IAVs) of the                  
       (Gs/Gd) lineage were first detected in wild, captive,
and domestic birds in North America [1–4]. HP IAVs of
the H5N8 subtype in North America were genetically
similar at all eight gene segments to viruses causing re-
cent poultry outbreaks in South Korea and Japan [1, 2],
whereas those of the H5N2 and H5N1 subtypes were
comprised of gene segments of North American and
Eurasian ancestral lineages [1, 3, 4]. The timing and
route by which Gs/Gd lineage HP H5 IAVs were intro-
duced to North America are still unclear; however, several
studies have suggested wild migrating birds to be a poten-
tial mechanism of introduction from Asia [2, 5, 6].

Genetic and ecological data from the Republic of
Korea provide evidence for: (1) an association between
the detection of Gs/Gd lineage HP H5 IAVs and the
presence of both wild and domestic waterfowl, (2) few
detections of HP IAVs during summer months when mi-
gratory waterfowl are largely absent from the region, and
(3) evolution of HP IAVs between wintering seasons for
migratory birds in a currently unknown reservoir popula-
tion [5]. This scenario is parsimonious with viral mainten-
ance at northerly breeding areas for migratory birds;
however, other explanations such as non-detection of
Gs/Gd lineage IAVs in resident domestic and wild birds
cannot be ruled out. Similarly, detections of HP IAVs in
wild birds and domestic poultry occurred repeatedly in
North America during winter and spring of 2015, but
tapered off by summer, raising the possibility that migra-
tory birds could disperse viruses to northerly breeding
areas where they may be maintained to eventually seed
future poultry outbreaks as birds migrate back to winter-
ing grounds. Alternatively, HP IAVs recently detected in
North America may not be maintained in the wild bird
reservoir and therefore may not be found at northern
latitude breeding areas despite surveillance efforts.
To assess the evidence for migratory birds dispersing
HP H5 IAVs from lower latitude wintering areas to north-
ern breeding grounds, we sampled wild birds during
spring and summer at one of the largest breeding grounds
in North America, the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, Alaska.
We sampled hunter-harvested birds from ten remote vil-
lages in the spring and live-captured birds during summer
to test for infection with IAVs, specifically screening for
Gs/Gd lineage HP H5 viruses. Although sampling in re-
mote regions of Alaska such as the Yukon-Kuskokwim
Delta provides logistical challenges for surveillance, infor-
mation derived from this effort provides an opportunity
to gather evidence for or against the hypothesis that
wild birds maintain Gs/Gd HP H5 IAVs through spring
migration with relatively little potential for confounding
associated with anthropogenic activities such as poultry
production.
Methods
Hunter-harvested birds were sampled for IAVs at ten vil-
lages within the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, Alaska (Fig. 1)
during May 2015 as part of the subsistence season. This
is a traditional harvest period for native people living in
this region during which migratory birds are harvested
for personal use. Subsistence hunters brought intact har-
vested birds for viral sampling to health clinics located
in each village: Chefornak, Eek, Emmonak, Hooper Bay,
Kipnuk, Kotlik, Kwethluk, Pilot Station, Quinhagak, and
Toksook Bay (Fig. 1). At sampling stations for each village,
swab samples for viral screening were collected from each
bird by applying a polyester-tipped applicator to each the
oropharynx/trachea and the cloaca and swabbing. Paired
samples were then combined in a single cryovial with
2 ml of chilled viral transport media supplemented with
antibiotics. Samples were then placed directly in dewars
charged with liquid nitrogen and transferred to -80 ° C
freezers until testing.
In summer, cackling geese (Branta hutchinsii) were
sampled at remote sites near the Anerkochik River (Fig. 1)
during 16–19 July as part of banding efforts conducted by
the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge. Geese were
captured during the flightless molting period in drives
using lead fences to guide birds into a capture pen with
assistance from a helicopter and 6-person ground crew to
encourage directionality of bird movements (United States
Department of the Interior federal bird banding permit
#09811; USFWS-Region 7 IACUC #2015-009). After
capture, and application of a metal tarsal band, paired
oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs were collected as pre-
viously explained for hunter-harvested birds (United States
Department of the Interior federal bird banding permit
#20022; USGS Alaska Science Center ACUC #2015-13).
Samples were kept cool/frozen upon collection until
transfer to -80 ° C freezers within approximately one
week of collection.
In the laboratory, all paired swab samples were screened
using rRT-PCR targeting gene products for the IAV
matrix gene [7] and the Gs/Gd lineage HP H5
hemagglutinin gene segment [8]. All spring samples
yielding Ct values ≤ 41 for the IAV matrix gene and all
summer samples (regardless of Ct value for the IAV matrix
gene) were inoculated into specific pathogen-free em-
bryonated chicken eggs for virus isolation [9]. Amnio-
allantoic fluids were collected after 120 h, and tested
via hemagglutination assay. RNAs extracted from
hemagglutination assay positive amnio-allantoic fluids
were screened for the IAV matrix gene by rRT-PCR
[10] and resultant isolates were genomically sequenced
[11] (GenBank; accession #’s:     0452–    0492).
Pairwise nucleotide distance comparisons were made
between sequences for all gene segments for viruses
isolated as part of this study and those for the following
representative Eurasian lineage and intercontinental
reassortant HP IAVs detected in North America using
MEGA6 [12]: A/American green-winged teal/WA/19570/
2014 (H5N1),                                 
(H5N2), and                     -6/2014 (H5N8).
To infer the continental lineage of each internal gene seg-
ment of isolates recovered from the Yukon-Kuskokwim
Delta, maximum-likelihood phylogenies were reconstructed
for each gene segment in MEGA6 [12] using 1,000
bootstrap replicates and representative reference sequences
for viruses originating from Eurasia and North America.
As phylogenetic analysis may have limited utility for infer-
ring continental lineages of surface glycoproteins, we used
             Virology Journal (2016) 13:55 Page 2 of 6
the standard NCBI nucleotide Basic Local Alignment
Search Tool (BLAST) to gain inference on closely related
viral strains (BLAST conducted 4 December 2015).
Results
We did not detect HP H5 IAVs from 1,129 birds sampled
on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, Alaska, during spring
and summer 2015. However, we did detect five low patho-
genic (LP) IAVs from samples collected from cackling and
greater white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons) during spring
(Table 1). Samples were collected from at least 36 different
species of wild birds (Table 1); however, the sample collec-
tion was biased by taxonomic order (waterfowl 1,014/
1,129; 90 %) and season (spring 1,014/1,129; 90 %). The
overall virus isolation rate for our sample collection was
0.4 % (5/1,129). Species specific virus isolation rates were
1.0 % (2/200) and 1.0 % (3/298) for cackling and greater
white-fronted geese in spring, respectively, and 0 % for all
other species in spring and cackling geese in summer.
Four isolates from cackling and greater white-fronted
geese were of the H6N1 (n = 2), H6N2, and H9N2 com-
bined subtypes. A fifth isolate was the result of a mixed
infection that included H3 and N7 gene segments. Three
isolates originated from samples collected in Pilot Station
(                              -3902/2015 [H6N1],
A/greater white-fronted goose/Alaska/UG    -3903/2015
[H6N1], and A/greater white-fronted goose/Alaska/
UG    -3913/2015 [H6N2]) whereas one isolate origi-
nated from each Hooper Bay (                        
UG    -3075/2015 [H9N2]) and Toksook Bay (A/greater
white-fronted goose/Alaska/UG    -4167/2015[H3N7]).
Shared nucleotide sequence identity between LP IAV
strains isolated from Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta geese and
representative strains of HP IAV isolated in North
America in 2014–2015, was generally less than 99 %
with few exceptions (Additional file 1: Tables S1–S8).
One of the two NP sequences (variant #2) for A/greater
white-fronted goose/Alaska/UG    -4167/2015 (mixed)
shared 99 % identity with                             
2014 (H5N2) (Additional file 1: Table S5). Additionally,
the N1 NA gene segments for A/greater white-fronted
goose/Alaska/UG    -3903/2015 (H6N1) and           
                   -3902/2015 (H6N1) shared 99 %
identity with A/American green-winged teal/WA/19570/
2014 (H5N1) (Additional file 1: Table S6).
Nucleotide sequences for internal gene segments of
IAVs isolated from cackling and greater white-fronted
geese were of North American lineages for four isolates

(Additional file 2: Figures S1–S6). In contrast, A/greater
white-fronted goose/Alaska/UG    -4167/2015 (mixed)
appeared to include gene segments of both North
American and Eurasian lineages. Sequences for the PB2,
NP (variant #1), M, and NS (variant #1) gene segments
of A/greater white-fronted goose/Alaska/UG    -4167/
2015 (mixed) were of Eurasian lineage (Additional file 2:
Figures S1, S4–S6) whereas sequences for the PB1, NP
(variant #2), and NS (variant #2) gene segment appeared
to be of North American lineage (Additional file 2:
Figures S2, S4, and S6). NCBI BLAST provided similar
results as compared to phylogenetic analyses with top
hits for HA and NA gene segments for four of five iso-
lates from geese providing evidence for shared nucleo-
tide identity of 96–99 % with isolates derived from
dabbling ducks sampled in North America, including
the American green-winged teal sampled in Washing-
ton and infected with a Gs/Gd lineage HP H5N1 IAV
(Additional file 1: Table S9). In contrast, top BLAST
hits for sequences for HA and NA gene segments from
A/greater white-fronted goose/Alaska/UG    -4167/
2015 (mixed) indicated 97 % shared nucleotide identity
with IAVs isolated from wild birds sampled in Eurasia
(Additional file 1: Table S9).
Discussion
We did not detect any direct evidence for the circulation
of HP H5 IAVs in wild birds sampled on the Yukon-
Kuskokwim Delta, Alaska, during spring or summer of
2015. Probable explanations include that HP H5 IAVs
were not present in the region or that prevalence of such
viruses were sufficiently low in local wild waterfowl so as
to preclude detection during sampling periods. Other
explanations include that HP H5 IAVs were circulating
in waterfowl species poorly represented in our sample col-
lection or non-waterfowl species that were not sampled
during our collection efforts.
Sampling of hunter-harvested birds from a relatively
large number of villages spread across the region likely
provides representative information regarding IAV preva-
lence for the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta for the sampling

period, particularly for species for which we were able to
obtain larger sample sizes. Unlike baited trap sites which
may increase viral transmission among animals using cap-
ture locations [13], hunter-harvested birds are more likely
to be independent samples and therefore reflective of nat-
ural infection prevalence in a study system. Despite a con-
siderable sampling effort on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta
during spring and summer, few LP IAVs were recovered
from our sample collection. However, the rate at which
we isolated viruses in two species of geese sampled in
spring was comparable to reported estimated viral preva-
lence for four species of geese in this region during spring
2006–2010 using rRT-PCR (1.78 %) [14]. The lack of isola-
tion of viruses from other avian species or cackling geese
during summer is also consistent with low recovery of vi-
ruses from dabbling ducks sampled in this region during
spring [15] and low estimates for viral prevalence in geese
during summer (0 %) [14].
Genetic characterization of five LP IAVs provided only
limited evidence for circulation of similar genetic diver-
sity as previously found in Gs/Gd lineage HP IAVs in
North America; however, this diversity could also be
maintained in the absence of HP IAVs in this region. Al-
though it is possible that gene segments found to be
highly similar to HP intercontinental reassortant IAVs is
a function of recent presence of such viruses in the
Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta region, it is likely that North
American lineage gene segments sharing recent common
ancestry with those detected in HP intercontinental reas-
sortant viruses circulated in the Pacific Flyway prior to the
introduction or evolution of these IAVs in North America.
As such, gene segments sharing high similarity with inter-
continental reassortant HP IAVs may continue to circulate
independent of outbreaks of HP influenza in North
America. Similar to this investigation, gene segments
sharing high nucleotide identity with intercontinental
reassortant HP H5N1 and H5N2 IAVs were detected in
migratory waterfowl sampled at nearby Izembek National
Wildlife Refuge in autumn of 2014 [6].
Four combined subtypes for LP IAVs detected in cack-
ling and greater white-fronted geese were not previously
reported in an investigation genetically characterizing 90
LP IAVs isolated from waterfowl sampled on the Yukon-
Kuskokwim Delta between 2006 and 2009 [15]. Additional
sampling of geese for IAVs during spring is therefore ne-
cessary for understanding seasonal subtype diversity in
this region. The finding of four North American lineage
IAV isolates from geese sampled on the Yukon-
Kuskokwim Delta is not unexpected and is likely a
function of migratory tendencies of many geese migrating
to the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta from wintering areas of
the Pacific and Central Flyways of North America. How-
ever, the identification of numerous Eurasian lineage gene
segments in one of the five isolates we recovered supports
earlier conclusions that migratory connectivity of birds
between the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta and East Asia also
influences IAV dynamics in western Alaska. Ongoing
surveillance in western Alaska at locations such as the
Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta and Izembek National Wild-
life Refuge will continue to provide data on temporal
variations in influenza prevalence and diversity as well
as the relative frequency of viral exchange between East
Asia and North America via Beringia.
Conclusion
Research and surveillance efforts for IAVs conducted on
the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, Alaska, during 2015 do not
provide any direct evidence for the circulation of Gs/Gd
lineage HP H5 IAVs in this region. Possible reasons for
lack of detection are numerous. Our results suggest that
on-going and additional research and surveillance strat-
egies, such as refined epidemiological modeling, targeting
wintering areas of migratory birds [16], and sampling of
avian and non-avian taxa in regions with high concen-
trations of poultry [17], are necessary to understand the
distribution and maintenance of Gs/Gd lineage IAVs in
North America.
