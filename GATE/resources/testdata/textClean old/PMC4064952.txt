Abstract: In the last 20 years, atrial fibrillation (AF) has become one of the most important
public health problems and a significant cause of increasing health care costs in western
countries. The prevalence of AF is increasing due to our greater ability to treat chronic
cardiac and noncardiac diseases, and the improved ability to suspect and diagnose AF. At
the present time, the prevalence of AF (2%) is double that reported in the last decade. The
prevalence of AF varies with age and sex. AF is present in 0.12%–0.16% of those younger
than 49 years, in 3.7%–4.2% of those aged 60–70 years, and in 10%–17% of those aged
80 years or older. In addition, it occurs more frequently in males, with a male to female
ratio of 1.2:1. The incidence of AF ranges between 0.21 and 0.41 per 1,000 person/years.
Permanent AF occurs in approximately 50% of patients, and paroxysmal and persistent
AF in 25% each. AF is frequently associated with cardiac disease and comorbidities. The
most common concomitant diseases are coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease, and
cardiomyopathy. The most common comorbidities are hypertension, diabetes, heart failure,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal failure, stroke, and cognitive disturbance.
­
Paroxysmal AF occurs in younger patients and with a reduced burden of both cardiac dis-
ease and comorbidities. Generally, the history of AF is long, burdened by frequent recur-
rences, and associated with symptoms (in two thirds of patients). Patients with AF have a
five-fold and two-fold higher risk of stroke and death, respectively. We estimate that the
number of patients with AF in 2030 in Europe will be 14–17 million and the number of
new cases of AF per year at 120,000–215,000. Given that AF is associated with significant
morbidity and mortality, this increasing number of individuals with AF will have major
public health implications.

Introduction
In the last two decades, atrial fibrillation (AF) has become one of the most important
public health issues and an important cause of health care expenditure in western
countries. Even if AF is not a life-threatening arrhythmia, it influences quality of
life significantly as a result of its anatomic, hemodynamic, and hemocoagulative
consequences. In addition, AF is frequently associated with disturbing symptoms
and very important socioeconomic problems, such as permanent disability, cognitive
disturbance, hospitalization, and absence from work.1
Given that the prevalence ofAF
continues to increase, it is crucial to have an updated picture of the epidemiological,
clinical, and social impact of AF to plan appropriate interventions and adequately
allocate human and economic resources.

Search strategy
A systematic review of the studies reported on the epidemi-
ology of AF in Europe was performed using the electronic
MEDLINE and PubMed databases. The search terms
included: “atrial fibrillation”, “atrial tachyarrhythmias”,
“epidemiology”, “burden”, “rhythm control”, “rate control”,
“stroke”, “heart failure”, “outcome”, “anticoagulant therapy”,
and “antiplatelet therapy”. Studies published from 2005 to
2014 with a prespecified protocol (how AF was ascertained,
diligence with which medical records were sought, modes
of clinical assessment, and follow-up of patient subgroups)
analyzing the epidemiology ofAF exclusively in the general
population were considered. When necessary (ie, absence in
the literature of data on temporal trends regarding the inci-
dence/prevalence ofAF and risk of stroke), investigations per-
formed before 2005 were used. The projected ­
burden of AF
in the European population in 2030 is based on ­
estimates of
demographic progression in Europe ­
according to Eurostat.2
Prevalence and incidence of AF
The most important studies on the epidemiology of AF
carried out in developed countries and published between
the end of the 20th century and the first years of the 21st
century estimated that the prevalence ofAF ranged between
0.5% and 1% in the general population.3,4
However, in the
last decade, the common opinion was that the prevalence of
AF, as perceived by number of hospitalizations, emergency
room visits, and burden of outpatient visits forAF, had to be
­
markedly higher.4–6
The most recent studies have ­
confirmed
this perception and shown that the prevalence of AF in the
general adult population of Europe is more than double
that reported just one decade earlier, ranging from 1.9%
in Italy, Iceland, and England to 2.3% in Germany and
2.9% in ­
Sweden ­
(Figure 1). In particular, for Iceland, the
mean increase of AF prevalence in the global population
is 0.04% per year (data for the period 1998–2008), with a
mean increase of 0.12% and 0.07% per year, respectively,
in men and women aged 65–74 years, 0.27% and 0.23% in
those aged 75–84 years, and 2.8% and 0.27% in those older
than 84 years.
In the USA, although updated information on the
prevalence of AF in the global population is not available,
it appears that the prevalence of AF has increased by 0.3%
per year in Medicare beneficiaries older than 65 years, with
an absolute growth of 4.5% (from 4.1% to 8.6%) in the
period 1993–2007.7–12
The most likely explanation for such
a significant increase is the greater ability to treat chronic
cardiac and noncardiac diseases, the aging population, and
the improved ability to suspect and diagnose AF.13
However,
despite this increase, the real prevalence of AF is probably
still underestimated because it is well known thatAF, in a dis-
crete proportion (10%–25%) of cases, occurs in the absence
of symptoms.13,14
Very likely, ifAF was detected appropriately
by active screening, its prevalence would be higher and closer
to 3%, as estimated for 2015 in the USA.3,14
In developing
countries, AF occurs in approximately 0.6% of males and
0.4% of females. Although these rates are markedly lower
than in developed nations, it appears that the burden of AF

Epidemiology of atrial fibrillation
in these countries is enough to be a potential problem for
health care systems.15
The prevalence of AF varies with age
and sex. AF is present in 0.12%–0.16% of subjects younger
than 49 years, 3.7%–4.2% of those aged 60–70 years, and
10%–17% of those aged 80 years or older. In addition, it
occurs more frequently in males, with a male to female ratio
of approximately 1.2:1. Despite the greater prevalence in
men, women represent the bulk of patients with AF due to
their longer survival.7–12,15,16
Less information is available on the incidence ofAF. One
of the first investigations of this problem was the Framingham
study that in 1982 reported the overall incidence of chronic
AF at two per 1,000 on biannual electrocardiography in
patients aged 32–65 years.17
Subsequently, only few stud-
ies have analyzed this issue, with results that are not easily
comparable because of a lack of homogeneity with regard
to the characteristics of enrolled populations, ie, different
age limits, different types of AF analyzed (all together, only
permanentAF), different reservoirs of recruitment (members
of health insurance funds or national health care systems),
and different ways of diagnosing AF (classification based
on administrative data, identification based on judgment of
general practitioners). However, from these studies, it appears
that among US Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years or
older, the incidence ofAF has not changed substantially from
1993 (27.3 per 1,000 person/years) to 2007 (28.3 per 1,000
person/years), has always remained higher among men (34
per 1,000 person/years in men versus 25 per 1,000 person/
years in women), and has continued to be much higher in the
elderly population (18.8 per 1,000 person/years in those aged
70–74 years versus 53.9 per 1,000 person/years in those aged
84–89 years).10
Similar data were reported for another study
performed in the USA, ie, the Olmsted County population
in subjects aged 18 years and over. The incidence of AF has
increased only slightly in this region between 1980 (3.04 per
1,000 person/years) and 2000 (3.68 per 1,000 person/years).18
In Europe, the most recent studies performed in the global
population over the last decade report an incidence of AF
ranging from 0.23 per 1,000 person/years in Iceland to 0.41
in Germany and 0.9 in Scotland, respectively.4,8,11
Also, in
Europe, the incidence of AF increases with age and differs
with sex, even if the reported rates are lower than those of
the USA population. In Scotland, Germany, and the USA,
subjects aged 65 years or older show anAF incidence of 4.7,
4.1, and 28.3 per 1,000 person/years, respectively; those aged
65–74 years show an incidence of 3.2, 10.8, and 15.5 (mean
value between those aged 65–69 years and 70–74 years) per
1,000 person/years; and those aged 75–84 years show an
incidence of 6.2, 16.8, and 33.5 (mean value between those
aged 75–79 years and 80–84 years) per 1,000 person/years.
A possible explanation for such marked differences lies in
the method used to define the first episode of AF, ie, on the
basis of administrative data (uncertainty in classifying the
types of AF by the International Classification of Diseases
diagnosis codes, the definition of prevalent AF generally
made in inpatients, difficulties in assessing patients with
a first episode of AF) or a documented history of AF as in
Germany and Scotland.4,8,10
Types of AF, characteristics
of AF patients, and impact
of AF on health care systems
Observational studies performed in the general population or
in patients hospitalized forAF show that permanentAF is the
most frequent form of diagnosed AF; it occurs in 40%–50%
of patients, followed by the paroxysmal and ­
persistent
forms that each occur in 20%–30% of cases ­
(Figure 2).9,19–22
­
Generally, the history of AF is long and burdened by fre-
quent recurrences. In France and Germany, theALFA (Etude
en Activité Libérale de la Fibrillation Auriculaire)23
and
ATRIUM (OutpAtienT RegIstry Upon Morbidity of atrial
fibrillation)19
studies showed that the mean time elapsed
between the first episode ofAF and the date of patient assess-
ment was 47±63 months and 61±66 months, respectively;
in Italy, the ISAF (Italian Survey of Atrial Fibrillation man-
agement) study showed that the history of AF was less than
one year in only 13% of patients in whom AF was detected,
5–10 years in 30%, and .10 years in 18%. Approximately
one fifth of AF patients are found to have suffered at least
two recurrences during the previous year of observation and
three quarters during the previous 5 years.9,19,22,23
AF is often
associated with symptoms, sometimes disabling, that are
resistant to drug therapy and necessitate transcatheter abla-
tion. More specifically, despite adequate treatment, palpita-
tions occur in 42%–55% of patients, asthenia in 15%–49%,
dyspnea in 24%–49%, and angina in 10%–20%.Arrhythmia
occurs without symptoms in only 12%–25% of patients with
AF.9,19,21,23
The vast majority of patients have a European Heart
Rhythm Association score of II to IV; those with ­
permanent
AF complain more frequently of dyspnea or asthenia and
fatigue, and those with the paroxysmal form complain more
of palpitations.19,23,24
The high rates of recurrence, disturbing
symptoms, and clinical sequelae (stroke, heart failure, initia-
tion of new antiarrhythmic drugs, drug-related complications,
interventional therapy) contribute strongly to the use of
health care resources. In Italy, AF is the cause of 1.5% of all

emergency room visits; in Germany, the average number of
hospitalizations with anAF diagnosis is 0.24 per year and the
average number of outpatient consultations is 5.62 per year;
in Scotland, the one-year out-of-hospital contact rate for AF
is eight per 1,000 person/years, ranging from 0.2 in subjects
aged ,45 years to 62 per 1,000 person/years in those aged
74–85 years.4,6,8,9
In the USA, the bed utilization for AF as
a primary diagnosis was approximately one million days in
1991 and 1.38 million days in 1999, representing a bed uti-
lization that is similar to that needed for all the other cardiac
arrhythmias combined. RealiseAF (REAl-LIfe global Survey
Evaluating patients with Atrial Fibrillation) showed that one
third of patients withAF had been hospitalized in the previous
12 months.24
Acute decompensation of heart failure is the
leading cause of hospitalization in the persistent and perma-
nent forms ofAF (12.9% and 13.6%, respectively), followed
by an acute coronary event (7.7% and 7.3%, respectively) and
stroke (5% and 7.4%, respectively). The need for new use of
antiarrhythmic drugs and proarrhythmic events from antiar-
rhythmic drugs are the most frequent causes of hospitalization
among patients with paroxysmal AF (12.3%).24,25
AF is frequently associated with cardiac disease and with
cardiac/noncardiac comorbidity. Hypertensive heart disease
(22%–36%), coronary heart disease (14%–32%), valvular
heart disease (12%–26%), and cardiomyopathy (6%–10%)
are the most common illnesses associated withAF, while the
most frequent comorbidities are hypertension (67%–76%),
heart failure (22%–42%), diabetes (20%–24%), obesity
(20%–35%), chronic pulmonary disease (10%–18%), thyroid
dysfunction (8%–11%), renal failure (11%–22%) stroke/
transient ischemic attack (9%–16%), and neuropsychiatric
disturbances (19%). In particular, one third of AF patients
have at least three associated comorbidities; no comorbid-
ity or cardiac disease is present in one fifth and one quarter
of patients, respectively. Lone AF (defined on the basis of
the strict criteria of the European Society of Cardiology) is
present in a low proportion of cases, ranging between 2%
and 12%.4,9,16,20–23
Patients with paroxysmal AF are younger
and have a lower frequency of heart disease and comorbidity
than those with permanent AF.16,19–21
Progression to permanent AF
In the past, the majority of AF studies have been carried out
by considering AF as a whole, without a clear distinction of
the subtypes. As shown previously, the different types of AF
are associated not only with different clinical patient profiles,
but also with different long-term outcomes. Epidemiological
studies have shown also that the clinical setting of AF is an
evolving picture that generally begins with the paroxysmal
form and ends with the permanent form, covers different
clinical pathways and treatment strategies, and results in
different long-term outcomes.26–30
From these studies, it
appears that the progression from paroxysmal to permanent
AF is characterized by a trend that shows an initial peak rate
at the first year after AF diagnosis followed by a continuous
“crescendo” that depends on the clinical profile of the patient

Epidemiology of atrial fibrillation
and the site of the patient’s clinical management.As reported
by De Sisti et al in France and by the Canadian Registry
of Atrial Fibrillation investigators in Canada, during the
first year,AF evolves to the permanent form in ­
approximately
4% of patients managed in tertiary arrhythmia centers and
in 9% of those managed in the real-world setting. Over
time, the progression becomes less evident, with a slow but
steady trend that is strictly related to poorer clinical condi-
tions and reaches rates of 18% and 25%, respectively, at
5 years of follow-up. In particular, progression is slower for
the paroxysmal form and faster for the persistent form.27,28
In Europe, the Euro Heart Survey investigators reported a
progression to permanent AF in 15% of patients with par-
oxysmal AF and 30% of those with persistent AF.29
These
rates are significantly higher than those found in Canada,
but in the European investigation patients showed either less
severe cardiac disease or comorbidities.This consideration is
consistent with the finding that the variables independently
related to progression to permanent AF are age, an enlarged
left atrium, lack of antiarrhythmic drugs, VVI pacing, and
the presence of valvular heart disease, heart failure, hyperten-
sion, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.9,26–29
In this
regard, the HATCH score (an acronym for “heart failure,
age, previous transient ischemic attack, chronic pulmonary
disease, hypertension”) can predict the risk with satisfactory
power (area under the curve 0.68).31
Prognosis
The largest epidemiological studies have clearly shown
that AF is associated with an increased risk of stroke (both
­
ischemic and hemorrhagic), hemorrhagic consequences (due
to anticoagulation therapy), and death. Cognitive ­
dysfunction,
heart failure, and socioeconomic implications are further
important consequences of AF. It is estimated that 20% of
all strokes occur in the setting of AF; this rate increases to
25% in patients aged .80 years. Patients with AF have an
age-adjusted risk of stroke that is five-fold higher than in the
normal population regardless of the type ofAF.32–34
Since the
introduction of systematic use of anticoagulants, the absolute
number of ischemic strokes has decreased dramatically. In
USA, the rate of ischemic stroke among Medicare benefi-
ciaries with AF aged 65 years or older was 48 per 1,000
person/years in 1992 and 17 per 1,000 person/years in 2007;
this means a 65% decrease in the ischemic stroke rate over
15 years.35
In Sweden, the annual rate of ischemic stroke in
the global population of AF patients is 25 per 1,000 person/
years among those treated with anticoagulants and 45 per
1,000 person/years in those who are not treated.36
In France,
the cumulative incidence of ischemic stroke is ten per
1,000 person/years in patients with a CHADS2
score $1.37
In such countries, during the same periods of observation
and despite the wider use of anticoagulants, the rate of
intracranial hemorrhage has remained unchanged at a rate
of two per 1,000 person/years.35,36
Stroke secondary to AF
is associated with a 50% increased risk of serious disability.
Cognitive dysfunction, including vascular dementia, is
present in 10%–15% of patients with AF, which is twice the
rate in patients without AF. Cognitive disturbances are also
frequently found inAF patients, even in the absence of overt
stroke, as a consequence of multiple asymptomatic cerebral
emboli that can be found on cerebral imaging in a discrete
percentage of cases.9,38,39
AF and heart failure coexist in a large percentage of
patients (22%–42%) and share risk factors. In addition, each
of these conditions strongly predisposes to the other.40
Women
and men with AF have an eleven-fold and three-fold higher
risk, respectively, of developing heart failure in comparison
with those without AF. Both these conditions are associated
with an adverse prognosis “quod vitam”, and the occurrence
of new AF in patients with heart failure is associated with
a two-fold higher risk of death in comparison with those
without AF.41–43
AF is also associated with increased mortality. In the
USA, among Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years or older
­
followed from 1993 to 2007, the global mortality rate after
­
incident AF was 10.8% in the short-term (30 days), 24.7%
in the medium term (one year), and 42% in the long term (3
years).These rates have changed only slightly and not signifi-
cantly over time.10
In Sweden, during the period 1995–2008,
patients enrolled in the Swedish National Patient Registry
showed a global mortality rate of 40% after diagnosis of
incidentAF and 60% at 5 and 10 years, respectively, versus a
rate of 20% and 40% in those withoutAF.The relative risk of
dying was higher in women than in men and decreased with
age. Women and men aged ,65 years had an adjusted rela-
tive risk of 4.88 and 3.07, respectively, of dying at one year,
those aged 65–74 years had a risk of 2.88 and 2.07, and those
aged 75–85 years had a risk of 2.09 and 1.72. AF was found
to be a significant risk factor for all-cause mortality together
with the presence of chronic renal failure, cancer, and chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease.44
Also, in Olmsted County,
during a period of observation of 24 years, new-onset AF
was found to be associated with a significantly increased risk
(67%) of all-cause mortality that was highest (hazard ratio
9.62) within the first 4 months of diagnosis and decreased
significantly thereafter (hazard ratio 1.66).45

Zoni-Berisso et al
The relationship between mortality and type of AF
is not clear. In the Women’s Health Study, persistent and
­
permanent AF (but not paroxysmal AF) have been found to
be significantly associated with mortality,46
and in the Loire
Valley AF Project, only permanent AF was found to be
significantly associated with mortality.47
Thus, even though
there is not yet clear evidence that the increased mortality
observed in patients withAF is directly due to arrhythmia or
to the numerous serious associated conditions, AF remains
a marker of a poor prognosis.
European perspective
Although the marked differences in population characteris-
tics present in the majority of the published epidemiological
studies (eg, different ages at enrolment, different types of
AF considered), the available data indicate a similar preva-
lence and incidence of AF throughout the developed world.
At the present time, among residents aged 15–20 years or
over in Europe, the prevalence of AF can be estimated at
2%, together with an incidence ranging between 0.23 and
0.41 per 1,000 person/years. Among these patients, the
annual rate of ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes is ­
estimated
to be 2% (1.3% in France, 1.7% in the USA, 4.5% in patients
not anticoagulated and 2.5% in patients anticoagulated in
Sweden) and 0.2%, respectively.The number of hospitaliza-
tions for AF is 0.25 per year and the number of outpatient
contacts is approximately six per year.This means that at the
present time in the European community (population 500
million people) there are approximately 10 million patients
with AF and 100,000–200,000 with new-onset AF. If the
estimated prevalence of AF increases by 0.04% per year
(as observed in Iceland in the overall population between
1998 and 2008) or by 0.08% (as estimated in the USA on a
population aged .20 years),3
and if the projected growth of
the ­
European population is 0.2%–0.3% (a combination of a
decrease in the young population and an increase among peo-
ple aged .65 years),2
in 2030 the prevalence ofAF would be
2.7%–3.3% in a ­
European population with 516–525 million
inhabitants. Therefore, within 15 years, the number of the
European citizens with AF will be 14–17 million and the
number of new AF cases will be 120,000–215,000 per year
(estimated incidence 0.23–0.41 per 1,000 person/years). In
particular, 7–8.5 million people will be affected by perma-
nentAF, 3.5–4.2 by persistentAF, and 3.5–4.2 by paroxysmal
AF. These data are in agreement with those of Krijthe et al,
who predict that there will be approximately 14 million
AF patients among individuals aged .55 years in 2030.48
To these figures must be added a further 280,000–340,000
new ischemic strokes, 3.5–4 million hospitalizations for
AF, and 100–120 million outpatient visits. The magnitude
of these data seems to confer an endemic dimension to this
health care problem, ­
implying not only a greater ­
engagement
of physicians but also a significant effort of health care
systems to improve AF prevention and treatment and to
facilitate the organization of social ­
interventions for the
cure of its ­
consequences. In the absence of proven effective
therapies for the primary prevention of AF, the attention of
physicians must be directed towards preventing the cardiac
conditions and comorbidities that represent significant risk
factors for AF. In particular, further efforts are needed to
understand better the longitudinal course of patients at risk
of developing AF in order to prevent complications.
