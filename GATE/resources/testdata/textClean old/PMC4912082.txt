Abstract
Background
Hantaan virus (HTNV), a negative sense tripartite RNA virus of the Family Bunyaviridae, is
the most prevalent hantavirus in the Republic of Korea (ROK). It is the causative agent of
Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFRS) in humans and maintained in the striped
field mouse, Apodemus agrarius, the primary zoonotic host. Clinical HFRS cases have
been reported commonly in HFRS-endemic areas of Gyeonggi province. Recently, the
death of a member of the ROK military from Gangwon province due to HFRS prompted an
investigation of the epidemiology and distribution of hantaviruses in Gangwon and
Gyeonggi provinces that border the demilitarized zone separating North and South Korea.
Methodology and Principal Findings
To elucidate the geographic distribution and molecular diversity of HTNV, whole genome
sequences of HTNV Large (L), Medium (M), and Small (S) segments were acquired from lung
tissues of A. agrarius captured from 2003–2014. Consistent with the clinical incidence of
HFRS established by the Korea Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (KCDC), the preva-
lence of HTNV in naturally infected mice in Gangwon province was lower than for Gyeonggi
province. Whole genomic sequences of 34 HTNV strains were identified and a phylogenetic
analysis showed geographic diversity of the virus in the limited areas. Reassortment analysis
first suggested an occurrence of genetic exchange of HTNV genomes in nature, ROK.
Conclusion/Significance
This study is the first report to demonstrate the molecular prevalence of HTNV in Gangwon
province. Whole genome sequencing of HTNV showed well-supported geographic lineages

Author Summary
Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFRS) and Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome
(HPS) are endemic zoonotic infectious diseases caused by hantaviruses that belong to the
Family Bunyaviridae containing negative-sense tripartite RNA genomes. Hantaviruses
pose a critical emerging public health threat, with up to 200,000 clinical cases reported
annually worldwide with 1–36% case fatality rates. In humans, hantavirus-borne diseases
are contracted by the inhalation of viruses aerosolized from rodent excreta. However,
there is no effective therapeutic or vaccine to prevent from the disease. Whole genome
sequences of Hantaan virus (HTNV) were acquired from lung tissues of Apodemus agrar-
ius captured in HFRS-endemic areas of the Republic of Korea (ROK). Phylogenetic analy-
ses demonstrated that sequences of the HTNV tripartite genomes clustered
geographically, showing broad diversity of HTNV throughout the areas surveyed. Reas-
sortment analysis first suggested a natural occurrence of the HTNV genetic exchange in
the ROK. These observations contribute to a better understanding of the genetic diversity
and molecular evolution of hantaviruses in HFRS-endemic regions. The complete
sequences of HTNV genomes will provide a database for the phylogeographic analysis and
surveillance of endemic hantavirus-borne diseases.
Introduction
Viruses in the Hantavirus genus of the family Bunyaviridae are negative-sense single-stranded
RNA virus containing Large (L), Medium (M), and Small (S) segments [1]. Hantaviruses pose
an emerging public health threat, with about 200,000 cases of human disease annually world-
wide and fatality rates of 1–36% [2, 3]. Old World hantaviruses, e.g., Hantaan virus (HTNV),
Puumala virus (PUUV), Seoul virus (SEOV), and Dobrava-Belgrade virus (DOBV), are etio-
logic agents of Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFRS) in Eurasia [4]. In America,
Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS) results from infections with New World hantaviruses,
e.g., Sin Nombre virus (SNV) and Andes virus (ANDV) [5]. In humans, HFRS and HPS are
contracted by inhaling aerosolized infectious particles from rodent salvia, urine, and feces [6].
Hantavirus infections are highly endemic and cause severe diseases in humans. However, there
are no effective therapies or vaccines against these viruses.
HTNV is harbored by striped field mice (Apodemus agrarius), which constitute about 70%
of the wild rodent population in the Republic of Korea (ROK) [7]. HFRS incidences increase
during the spring and fall, due to the dynamics of rodent populations [8]. Observance of HFRS
cases for military personnel and civilians near the demilitarized zone (DMZ) led to an investi-
gation of the geographic distribution and molecular epidemiology of HTNV in Gangwon and
Gyeonggi provinces [9–11]. Over decades, our studies have demonstrated the molecular simi-
larities and diversity of hantaviruses using viral genomic sequences identified from HFRS
patients and rodents where the patients were exposed in Gyeonggi province, the highest

endemic area in the ROK [8, 9, 12–15]. However, the molecular prevalence of hantaviruses in
Gangwon province remains unknown.
Reassortment is a genetic event that results in the exchange of genome segments, and it is a
major molecular mechanism to confer genetic diversity [16]. Influenza virus, a negative-sense
segmented RNA virus, frequently generates reassortants by switching genomes of viruses from
different hosts. Reassortment can play an important role in viral fitness, transmission, and
pathogenesis of segmented RNA viruses [17]. The genetic reassortment of hantaviruses has
been reported naturally and experimentally [18, 19]. A natural reassortment of SNV within
deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) occurred with the exchange of the M segment. Genetic
exchange of the M segment of DOBV was observed between low pathogenic DOBV-Aa and
highly pathogenic DOBV-Af in vitro. In addition, HTNV strains appeared to be highly diver-
gent in the limited region of Guizhou in China, with the generation of S segment reassortants
[20].
In this study, A. agrarius was collected in Gangwon and Gyeonggi provinces from 2003–
2014. To investigate the molecular epidemiology and distribution of HTNV, serological and
molecular screening of HTNV was performed from lung tissues of the rodents. Using 34 of
complete sequences of HTNV tripartite genomes, phylogenetic analyses show well-supported
geographic clusters of the L, M, and S segments in the ROK. Reassortment analysis first dem-
onstrated that HTNV in Dagmar North (DN), Paju, consists of the heterogeneous L segment
and homogeneous M and S segments, suggesting that the reassortment of HTNV may occur in
nature. This study provides a better understanding of the genetic diversity and molecular evo-
lution of HTNV tripartite genomes in the ROK. The whole genome sequences of HTNV will
establish a database for the phylogeographic analysis and surveillance of endemic outbreaks of
hantavirus infection.
Methods
Ethics statement
Trapping of rodents was approved by US Forces Korea (USFK) in accordance with USFK Reg-
ulation 40–1 “Prevention, Surveillance, and Treatment of Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syn-
drome”. Wild rodents were euthanized by cardiac puncture and tissues were dissected under
isoflurane anesthesia. All procedures and handling of rodents were conducted under an
approved protocol by the Korea University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(KUIACUC, #2010–212).
Rodent trapping
Rodents were captured in Gangwon and Gyeonggi provinces of the ROK, from 2003–2014
using live-capture Sherman traps (7.7 cm by 9 cm by 23 cm; H. B. Sherman, USA). A total of
100 traps were placed at intervals of about 4 m to 5 m at various US military training areas and
ROK civilian sites in Cheorwon, Chuncheon, Hwacheon, Inje, Pyeongchang, Yanggu, and Yan-
gyang in Gangwon province, and Dongducheon, Paju, Pocheon, Phyeongtaek, and Yeoncheon
in Gyeonggi province each day over 2–3 consecutive days for each trapping period (Fig 1).
Immunofluorescence assay (IFA) test
Rodent sera, diluted 1:32, were placed into duplicate acetone-fixed wells of Vero E6 cells
infected with HTNV, and the wells incubated at 37°C for 30 min. After incubation, the slides
were washed with Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS) and then fluorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (ICN Pharmaceuticals,Inc., USA) added to each well and

incubated at 37°C for 30 min. Following washes, the slides were examined for virus-specific
fluorescence, using an Axioscope fluorescent microscope (Carl Zeiss AG, Germany).
RNA extraction and RT-PCR
Lung tissues were mechanically homogenized using a FastPrep-24 5G Instrument (MP Biome-
dicals, USA) with TRI Reagent Solution (Ambion, USA). Total RNA was extracted from lung
tissues using a Hybrid R Kit (GeneAll, Korea) according to the manufacturer’s specifications.
cDNA was synthesized using M-MLV (Promega, USA) with random hexamers or O     (5'-
TAGTAGTAGACTCC-3') [21]. First and nested PCR were performed in 25 μl reaction mix-
tures containing 200 μM dNTP (Elpis Biotech, USA), 0.25 U of Super-Therm Taq DNA poly-
merase (JMR Holdings, UK), 1.5 μl of DNA, and 5 pM of each primer. Oligonucleotide primer
sequences for the first and nested PCR were specifically designed for HTNV. For the first and
nested PCR, the initial denaturation was performed at 94°C for 4 min, followed by six cycles of
denaturation at 94°C for 30 sec, annealing at 37°C for 30 sec, elongation at 72°C for 1 min, fol-
lowed by 32 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 sec, annealing at 42°C for 30 sec, elongation
at 72°C for 1 min, and then elongation at 72°C for 5 min. PCR products were extracted using a
PCR Purification Kit (Cosmo GENETECH, Korea), and DNA sequencing performed in an
Automatic Sequencer, Model ABI 3730XL DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, USA).
Whole genome sequencing
Viral cDNA was synthesized with random hexamers or O    . PCR was performed using
specific primer sets covering the whole tripartite genome of HTNV. The PCR program was as
follows: a cycle of 95°C for 5 min, 6 cycles of 95°C for 15 sec, 35°C for 30 sec, and 72°C for 20
sec, 30 cycles of 95°C for 15 sec, 42°C for 30 sec, and 72°C for 20 sec and then a cycle of 72°C
for 3 min.
Phylogenetic analysis
The nucleotide sequences of HTNV L, M, and S segments were determined from virus-infected
lungs of A. agrarius. Sequences were aligned and compared with HTNV sequences available in
GenBank, using the ClustalW tool in the Lasergene program, version 5 (DNASTAR, USA). For
the phylogenetic analysis, the Neighbor-Joining (NJ), Maximum Likelihood (ML), and Bayes-
ian methods (MrBayes 3.2.2 Program) were used. Topologies were evaluated by a bootstrap
analysis of 1000 iterations.
Reassortment analyses
Alignments of HTNV sequences were analyzed using RDP, GENECONV, MAXCHI, CHI-
MAERA, 3SEQ, BOOTSCAN, and SISCAN in the Recombination Detection Program 4
(RDP4) [22], with concatenated L, M, and S segments. P-values under 0.05 were considered
statistically significant. All parameters were left at the default RDP settings. The whole genome
sequences of HTNV from reassortants, parents, and in- and out-groups were aligned and used
to construct maximum likelihood trees of the individual segment in MEGA 5.2 [23].

seropositive for anti-HTNV IgG. Among the 774 samples, 36 (4.7%) and 738 (95.3%) of the
rodents were captured in Gangwon and Gyeonggi provinces, respectively. Fig 2 showed the
number of A. agrarius which was positive for anti-HTNV IgG from trapping sites. Anti-HTNV
IgG in A. agrarius from Chuncheon and Dongducheon was not detected. Total RNA was
extracted from the lung tissues of seropositive samples and determined for the presence of
HTNV RNA by RT-PCR. A 393-nucleotide partial sequence of HTNV M segment was recov-
ered from 544/774 (70.3%) of the seropositive samples; including 18 (3.3%) and 526 (96.7%) A.
agrarius in Gangwon and Gyeonggi provinces, respectively (Fig 2).
Whole genome sequencing
To obtain the whole tripartite genome sequences of HTNV, conventional PCR was performed
using multiple primer sets. The whole genome sequencing of the HTNV L, M, and S segments
was accomplished for 34 HTNV strains, including 3 strains from Cheorwon, 2 strains from
Hwacheon, 6 strains from Yanggu, 6 strains from DN in Paju, 8 strains from TBTA-N and -S

Gyeonggi province. The percent of nucleotide and amino acid sequence homologies of HTNV
newly acquired was shown in S1–S3 Tables.
Reassortment analysis
Phylogenetic analyses showed that the 7 group (DN, Paju) contained heterogeneous L segment
which was clustered with the L6 group (Hwacheon) (Fig 3). However, the M7 and S7 segments
of HTNV formed homogeneous clusters with the M2 and S2 groups (TBTA-N, Paju), respec-
tively (Figs 4 and 5). To evaluate the possibility of a reassortment event in the HTNV genomes,
the concatenated HTNV tripartite genomes from Gangwon and Gyeonggi provinces were
aligned and analyzed using RDP4 software package. Fig 6A shows P-values ranging from
1.632E-02 to 1.114E-17 based on the various recombination/reassortment analysis programs.
The RDP recombination consensus score (RDPRCS) of the 7 group (DN, Paju) is 0.522. Fig 6B
shows high percent of bootstrap support for a grouping of the HTNV M and S segments from
the 7 group (DN, Paju) and the 2 group (TBTA-N, Paju), whereas the L segment shows a high
similarity between the 7 group (DN, Paju) and the 6 group (Hwacheon). Eight HTNV stains
representing reassortants, parents, and in- and out- groups were used to generate maximum
likelihood trees of the HTNV L, M, and S segments, respectively (Fig 6C). These results suggest
that the 7 group (DN, Paju) were reassortants in nature based on the heterogeneity of the L seg-
ment, as the L segment formed a lineage with the 6 group (Hwacheon) in Gangwon province,
while the M and S segments clustered with the 2 group (TBTA-N, Paju) in Gyeonggi province.
Discussion
HFRS is highly endemic in Gangwon and Gyeonggi provinces, ROK, affecting both military
personnel and civilians. For decades, we conducted epidemiological and phylogeographic anal-
yses of HTNV in Gyeonggi province. Recent clinical cases of HFRS in Gangwon province,
including one deceased patient in 2013, prompted us to investigate the geographic distribution
and diversity of HTNV in Gangwon province [24].
A total of 5,929 A. agrarius were collected in the endemic areas of Gangwon and Gyeonggi
provinces from 2003–2014. IFA tests showed that 774 (13.1%) A. agrarius were seropositive for
anti-HTNV IgG. HTNV-specific RT-PCR showed that 544/774 (70.3%) A. agrarius were posi-
tive for a partial HTNV M segment. Based on the serological and molecular tests, there was a
lower prevalence of HTNV infections among A. agrarius in Gangwon province than in
Gyeonggi province. Although the number of A. agrarius was much lower for Gangwon prov-
ince, these data suggest that Gyeonggi province poses significantly higher HFRS health risks

provinces. The full-length sequences of the HTNV L segment were obtained from lung tissues of A. agrarius in
Gangwon and Gyeonggi provinces. A phylogenetic tree was generated by the ML method. Topologies were evaluated
by bootstrap analyses of 1000 iterations. The      (Tamura-Nei)+G model of evolution was used, based on an
alignment of the entire nucleotide sequence of the L segment, including strains HTN 76–118 (X55901) and HTN     4
(    3393).

than Gangwon province [8, 9, 14, 15]. To support this, the incidence of HFRS patients in Gang-
won province was lower than that in Gyeonggi province, demonstrating a correlation between
rodent seroprevalence and human disease data [25].
Using the complete genomic sequences of 34 HTNV strains newly obtained from eight dif-
ferent trapping sites, the phylogenetic trees of HTNV L, M, and S segments demonstrated well-
supported geographic clusters and showed the genetic diversity in the restricted areas. Diversi-
fication of HTNV, the Old World hantavirus, has been observed in China, a high HFRS-
endemic area [20]. In Guizhou, high level of the molecular diversity of HTNV strains were
observed. The ADNV, a New World hantavirus from southern South America, also exhibited
high molecular diversity of the M segment, resulting in five different lineages based on their
geographic origins in Argentina and Chile [26, 27]. Consistent with these observations, HTNV
strains in the restricted areas of the ROK showed a high molecular diversity representing geo-
graphic distinct clusters.
Reassortment, recombination, and genetic drift are molecular genetic mechanisms that con-
fer the genetic diversity in RNA viruses in nature [28]. Segmented RNA viruses preferentially
give rise to genetic reassortment rather than recombination. A reassortment event predicted by
RDP4 was considered significant if it satisfied at least 2 criteria with a P-value (p) <0.05 and
the RDPRCS was >0.6 [29]. When P <0.05 and the RDPRCS was between 0.4 and 0.6, the
genetic event was considered possible. An RDPRCS under 0.4 with P <0.05 was a cause to
reject the genetic event. The HTNV strains (the 7 group) from DN were likely reassortants
since these strains showed P <0.05 and an RDPRCS of 0.522 (HTNV from Hwacheon, 0.322;
HTNV from TBTA-N, 0.156).
The genetic reassortment of bunyaviruses in nature has been previously reported [30, 31].
Reassortments of SNV have more commonly been described in M segments than S or L seg-
ments in nature and in vitro [18, 31]. The L, M, and S segments of hantaviruses encode the
viral RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (the L protein), two surface glycoproteins (Gn and
Gc), and the nucleocapsid (N), respectively [32]. The less common reassortants of L or S seg-
ments than M segment might be associated with the function of these viral proteins. The main-
tenance of L and S segments might be beneficial for replication, transcription, and assembly,
resulting in the production of the progeny possessed appropriate viral fitness. Still, given our
limited understanding of this genetic mechanism, the existence of reassortants that contain dif-
ferent combinations of segments should not be ignored. Infection with Guaroa virus generated
the L segment reassortant, whereas the S segment reassortant was observed between Bunyam-
wera and California encephalitis viruses [33]. In this study, the reassortment analysis demon-
strated that HTNV (the 7 group) from DN in Paju showed heterogeneous L segment, but
homogeneous M and S segments. Whether the exchange of L segment is a determinant of the
fitness and pathogenesis of HTNV remains to be studied.
In conclusion, we report the phylogeographic analysis of full-length HTNV sequences from
A. agrarius collected in HFRS-endemic areas of Gangwon and Gyeonggi provinces, ROK.
These results demonstrate the geographic diversity and a possible reassortment of HTNV in
nature. This study greatly increases our understanding of the genetic diversity and molecular
evolution of HTNV in the hantavirus-endemic areas. The whole sequences of HTNV tripartite
Gangwon and Gyeonggi provinces. A phylogenetic tree was generated by the ML method. Topologies were evaluated
by bootstrap analyses of 1000 iterations. The T92 (Tamura 3-parameter)+G model of evolution was used, based on an
alignment of the entire nucleotide sequence of the M segment, including strains HTN 76–118 (M14627) and HTN
    4 (    3394).
