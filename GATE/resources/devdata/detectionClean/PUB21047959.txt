An influenza pandemic caused by swine-origin influenza virus A/H1N1 (H1N1pdm) spread worldwide in
2009, with 12,080 confirmed cases and 626 deaths occurring in Argentina. A total of 330 H1N1pdm viruses
were detected from May to August 2009, and phylogenetic and genetic analyses of 21 complete genome
sequences from both mild and fatal cases were achieved with reference to concatenated whole genomes. In
addition, the analysis of another 16 hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), and matrix (M) gene
sequences of Argentinean isolates was performed. The microevolution timeline was assessed and resis-
tance monitoring of an NA fragment from 228 samples throughout the 2009 pandemic peak was performed
by sequencing and pyrosequencing. We also assessed the viral growth kinetics for samples with replace-
ments at the genomic level or special clinical features. In this study, we found by Bayesian inference that
the Argentinean complete genome sequences clustered with globally distributed clade 7 sequences. The HA
sequences were related to samples from the northern hemisphere autumn-winter from September to
December 2009. The NA of Argentinean sequences belonged to the New York group. The N-4 fragment as
well as the hierarchical clustering of samples showed that a consensus sequence prevailed in time but also
that different variants, including five H275Y oseltamivir-resistant strains, arose from May to August 2009.
Fatal and oseltamivir-resistant isolates had impaired growth and a small plaque phenotype compared to
oseltamivir-sensitive and consensus strains. Although these strains might not be fit enough to spread in
the entire population, molecular surveillance proved to be essential to monitor resistance and viral
dynamics in our country.
Despite the worldwide countermeasures against the circula-
tion of emerging viruses, an influenza pandemic caused by
swine-origin influenza virus A/H1N1 started in Mexico City,
Mexico, on 18 March 2009 (33). The virus then spread world-
wide, affecting more than 213 countries and with 425,650 lab-
oratory-confirmed cases and at least 16,813 deaths occurring
(34). In Argentina, the virus was first detected on 17 May 2009.
Since then, 12,080 confirmed cases and 626 deaths have been
reported (21). In Buenos Aires, Argentina, the number of
cases of influenza-like illnesses and pneumonia widely ex-
ceeded that in the preceding years, and 742 H1N1 cases were
reported in 2009 (10).
The molecular signature of the 2009 H1N1 virus (H1N1pdm)
has revealed that a reassortant probably arose from the North
American H3N2 and H1N2 swine viruses and led to the emer-
gence of a new epidemic virus through host switching, transform-
ing an underestimated zoonosis into a pandemic threat that rap-
idly spread from human to human (7, 9). Phylogenetic analyses
have revealed the multiple origins of H1N1pdm, which comprises
genes derived from the avian lineage (polymerase basic 2 [PB2]
and polymerase A [PA]), the human H3N2 lineage (polymerase
basic 1 [PB1]), and the classical swine lineage (hemagglutinin
[HA], nuclear protein [NP], and nonstructural [NS]). In addition,
the neuraminidase (NA) and matrix (M) gene segments have
their origin in the Eurasian avian-like swine H1N1 lineage (30).
Amino acid signatures that were relevant for host speci-
ficity and virulence for the three different pandemic H1N1
influenza viruses from 1918, 1977, and 2009 have previously
been mapped at the genome level (28). Moreover, prelimi-
nary analyses have described the H1N1pdm viruses as sen-
sitive to neuraminidase inhibitors and resistant to adaman-
tanes (23).
Phylodynamics merges evolutionary analysis methods with
the investigation of viral dynamics. Viral genomes constitute
an important and independent source of information about
epidemiological processes that support and confirm the find-
ings of standard surveillance methods (25). A recent study
based on concatenated coding regions of available whole-ge-
nome H1N1pdm has shown that at least seven different clades
of viruses have been circulating globally (22).
In this report, we describe the analysis of the complete
genome sequences from 21 Argentinean isolates from both
mild and fatal cases and the analysis of another 16 HA, NA,
and M gene sequences from Argentinean isolates in order to
identify the origin of H1N1pdm in Buenos Aires. We also
analyzed the viral growth kinetics in strains with clinical rele-
vance. Furthermore, we describe the microevolution timeline
and resistance monitoring of an NA fragment from 228 sam-
ples throughout the 2009 pandemic peak by direct sequencing
and pyrosequencing.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Samples and viral isolation. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were referred
to the Virology Laboratory of the Dr. Ricardo Gutie
´rrez Children's Hospital,
Buenos Aires, Argentina, within the first days after the onset of symptoms to
ensure viral recovery. Diagnosis of H1N1pdm infection was carried out for all
samples by following the CDC real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR
(qRT-PCR) protocol for detection and characterization of swine influenza virus
(materials were kindly provided by the Influenza Branch, CDC) (4).
Viral isolation was performed by inoculating filtered NPAs into the amniotic
cavity of pathogen-free embryonated hen eggs (kindly provided by Immuner,
Entre Ríos, Argentina). Allantoic fluid was harvested after incubation for 5 days
at 37°C, following biosafety level 3 good laboratory practice. Viral RNA was
obtained with a PureLink viral RNA/DNA minikit (Invitrogen Life Technolo-
gies, Carlsbad, CA).
Molecular characterizations. (i) Polymorphism and phylogenetic analyses.
Sequences of the full-length genomes and HA, NA, and M gene segments were
obtained from the isolated viruses following the WHO-recommended protocol
(23) in an Applied Biosystems 3500 genetic analyzer (Foster City, CA). The
sequences were submitted to GenBank. Nucleotide alignments were obtained
with the ClustalX program (version 2.012) (15) and manually edited with the
BioEdit program (version 7.0.5.3) (11). For further analyses, all sequences avail-
able up to February 2010 were downloaded from the NCBI Influenza Virus
Resource (1). Because of the vast number of highly similar sequences, we de-
termined the optimal data set using a preliminary neighbor-joining analysis with
1,000 bootstraps performed with the MEGA program (version 4.0) (31). The
final data sets for genomic analysis included defined strains for the seven clades
described by               in 2009 (22).
Nucleotide substitution models were evaluated with the Jmodeltest program
(24). Bayesian consensus phylogenetic trees were inferred using Mr Bayes soft-
ware (version 3.1; 20,000,000 ngen, 5,000 samplefreq, 4 nchains, 5,000 burnin)
(27). Other phylogenetic inferences were estimated with algorithms available at
the Mobyle@Pasteur web server (http://mobyle.pasteur.fr). To infer the evolu-
tionary relationships and the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) for the HA
and NA Argentinean sequences, a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) method was applied using a strict molecular clock, as implemented in
the BEAST program (version 1.4.8). Trees were visualized and edited with the
FigTree program (version 1.2.3) included in the BEAST software package (6).
Amino acid sequences were inferred using the universal code, and polymor-
phisms were determined with Seqscape software (version 2.7; Applied Biosys-
tems) by comparing the sequences with the sequence of H1N1pdm reference
strain California/04. A hierarchical clustering of samples was performed for
visualization of the replacement changes.
Nonsynonymous changes were further classified as conservative or nonconser-
vative according to their polarity. The  ratio was calculated as number of
nonsynonymous substitutions versus the number of synonymous substitutions
(dN/dS). Recombination and the overall, gene-specific, and site-specific selection
pressures acting upon the viruses were determined using the procedures avail-
able in the HyPhy package and accessed through the Datamonkey web server
(13, 14).
(ii) Oseltamivir resistance monitoring. A 620-bp fragment (N-4) from the NA
gene ranging from amino acids 255 to 440 and including the codon positions 275
and 295 codons was obtained directly from NPAs following the WHO-recom-
mended sequencing protocol (23). Purified DNA fragments were sequenced
using the DYEnamic ET terminator cycle sequencing kit in an automated cap-
illary sequencer (MegaBACE 1000; GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ).
Pyrosequencing was performed by following the WHO protocol for influenza
A virus (H1N1) NA-H275 (4) using the PSQ     MA platform (Biotage AB,
Uppsala, Sweden). The relative proportions of sensitive and resistant variants
were determined with Pyromark ID software (version 1.0), following allele quan-
titation analysis.
Susceptibility of influenza viruses to oseltamivir was assessed by chemilumi-
nescence using an NA-Star influenza virus neuraminidase inhibitor resistance
detection kit (Applied Biosystems), following the manufacturer's instructions.
Prior to the assay, oseltamivir phosphate (50 M; kindly provided by Sidus S.A.,
Buenos Aires, Argentina) was activated by incubation with rat plasma at 37°C for
30 min and then diluted in half-log series (range, 0.03 to 1,000 nM) (16). The
tests were performed directly on NPA dilutions. In cases when the original
aspirate was no longer available or suitable for analysis, viral isolates were used.
Viral replication kinetics. For assessment of growth properties, MDCK cell
monolayers (kindly provided by INEI ANLIS Dr. Malbra
´n, Buenos Aires, Ar-
gentina) were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 0.001 plaque-forming units
(PFU/cell). Supernatants were collected at 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 h postin-
fection for viral titration by standard plaque assays. Plaque area was measured at
48 h after infection, using Quantity One software (version 4.6.8; Bio-Rad, Her-
cules, CA).
Nucleotide sequence accession numbers. The GenBank accession numbers for
the viruses obtained in this study are listed in Table S1 in the supplemental
material.
RESULTS
Viral detection. A total of 3,476 NPA specimens were re-
ferred to the Virology Laboratory of the Dr. Ricardo Gutie
´rrez
Children's Hospital between May and August 2009 and tested
for human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), influenza A and
B viruses (FluAV and FluBV, respectively), human parainflu-
enza virus (HPIV), and human adenovirus (HAdV). None of
the samples tested positive for HPIV type 1 or 2 or FluBV.
Three HRSV-FluAV coinfections without major clinical dif-
ferences were detected in June. A total of 330 out of the 367
FluAV-positive samples were typed as H1N1pdm by qRT-
PCR. Most cases were males (n  190, 63.3%), and the cases
were mainly less than 1 year old (n  143, 47.66%). The results
are summarized in Fig. 1.
In our laboratory, H1N1pdm detection began in May (first
case, 27 May 2009), had its peak in June (243 cases), decreased
in July (84 cases), and ended in August (2 cases). Sixteen
patients did not survive (4.84%); among them, the viruses from
11 patients were isolated and studied.
We also included in the analysis virus from a sporadic fatal
case from January 2010.
Genetic analyses. A total of 105 viruses were inoculated, and
62 were isolated after the first passage in the allantoic fluid of
embryonated hen eggs. From the 62 isolates, 37 HA, NA, and
M gene sequences were selected for genetic analyses. The
complete genome sequence was accomplished for 21 of those
isolates, including 12 viruses from mild cases and 9 viruses
from fatal cases. Details of the samples and GenBank acces-
sion numbers are listed in Table S1 in the supplemental ma-
terial.

served in all Argentinean samples. The exceptions were the
nonconservative change in PB2 S199A and the H1N1 (1918)
marker NP I100 (28). All the isolates presented a nonfunc-
tional PB1-F2 protein due to stop codons, as in all H1N1pdm
viruses described.
Replacements in HA (S220T), NP (V100I), NS1 (I123V),
and NA (V106I and N248D), known as specific gene markers
for clade 7, were present in all analyzed sequences (22). Ac-
cording to the first reports, three NA variants were identified
among the H1N1pdm viruses: the                      group
with variants V106 and N248, the                  group
with I106 and N248, and the                    group with
I106 and D248. All the samples analyzed belonged to the last
group (9, 12).
The 37 HA, NA, and M polymorphisms as well as compar-
isons of the 21 complete genomes are shown in Fig. 2.
The hierarchical clustering showed that there was a common
genetic signature in all samples, apart from the ones that be-
longed to clade 7 and H1N1pdm that could represent the
consensus sequence or genetic backbone for our data set (HA,
P100S, T214A, and I338V; NA, V106I; PA, P224S) and many
replacements that arose during the period but that did not
persist.
Unique replacements in HA, NA, and M were present in
viruses from severe and fatal cases without a common pattern.
Two isolates carried the N    5Y oseltamivir resistance mu-
tation (HN     and HN    ), and the alignment of the 37
Argentinean M genes showed that all samples were adaman-
tane resistant (S31N, I43T).
In summary, the replacements found in the HA and NA
proteins (11/15 and 7/14, respectively), as well as in the NS
(2/3) and PA proteins (2/4), were mostly nonconservative,

whereas those in the M1, M2, NP, PB1, and PB2 proteins were
more conservative.
The sequences derived from NPAs and chicken embryo iso-
lates were 100% identical for the N-4 fragment. Most of the
mutations described for adaptation in embryonated hen eggs
were absent (8).
Selection analysis. For selection analysis, nucleotide sites
were explored using the H     model of selection (1668,
1404, and 498 for HA, NA, and N-4, respectively). Duplicated
sequences (21/181, 36/213, and 151/180 for HA, NA, and N-4,
respectively) were excluded from this analysis.
According to at least one of the assay methods used (SLAC
[single likelihood ancestor counting], FEL [fixed effects likeli-
hood], IFEL [internal fixed effects likelihood], and REL [ran-
dom effects likelihood]), at the specified significance levels
(P  0.1 and Bayes factor  50), the per gene per site dN/dS
analyses revealed that two NA sites were under positive selec-
tion and 75 were under purifying selection (negatively se-
lected), with an overall dN/dS of 0.18, whereas for the N-4
fragment, 11 negatively selected codons with an overall dN/dS
of 0.24 were found.
A total of 73 nonneutral codons, 6 positively selected and 67
negatively selected, with an overall dN/dS of 0.3 were found in
HA (see Table S2 in the supplemental material).
No evidence for recombination was detected when the se-
quences were assessed by GARD (generic algorithm recombi-
nation detection) and SBP (single breakpoint recombination)
from the HyPhy package.
Phylogenetic analyses. Whole genomes of viruses from 12
mild and 9 fatal Argentinean cases were associated with clade
7 by Bayesian inference with high posterior probability (PP)
values (Fig. 3). Noteworthy, oseltamivir-sensitive and -resistant
isolates taken from the same patient a week apart clustered
together (isolates HN     and HN     and isolates
HN     and HN    ). The isolates from one of the fatal
cases of the outbreak (HN    ) and the 2010 fatal sporadic
case (HN    2) clustered alone, whereas the others (HNRG
isolates 3, 5, 21, 104, 105, 106, and 107) merged with the ones
from mild cases.
Similar topologies and statistical support were obtained by
neighbor-joining, maximum-parsimony, and maximum-likeli-
hood analyses (data not shown).
FIG. 3. Phylogenetic tree of concatenated complete genomes of Argentinean samples. Phylogeny was inferred with representative sequences
retrieved from GenBank using Mr Bayes software (version 3.1; settings, 20,000,000 ngen, 5,000 samplefreq, 4 nchains, 5,000 burnin). Clades are
indicated as 1 to 7, according to               (22). Argentinean strains are clustered in clade 7. The tree was rooted with H1N1pdm reference strain
California/04 (clade 1).

Phylogenetic analysis of the HA gene revealed that Argen-
tinean strains were further spread among four subclades in
clade seven (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). The
first subclade was composed of 18 identical sequences from
May to July 2009 (HNRG isolates 8, 13, 14, 17, 18, 20, 30, 31,
33, 41, 45, 48, 72, 83, 84, 91, 105, and 107). Only full-length HA
sequences were included in the tree. These strains were related
to previous isolates from the northern hemisphere, New York/
3209 from April 2009 and Stockholm/33 from May 2009, and to
subsequent strains, Norway/3036 from August 2009 and Mex-
ico City/    12N from September 2009. The second subclade
was composed of isolates HN    , -42, and -44 (PP  0.73)
and was 99.8% identical to subclade 1. The third subclade was
composed of isolates HNRG isolates 15, 82, and 23 (PP 
0.76), taken from the same patient 2 and 7 days after the first
sample. In this patient we observed the intratreatment emer-
gence of oseltamivir resistance by pyrosequencing, showing the
transition of the viral population from sensitive to resistant
(32). The last subclade was composed of the isolate from the
sporadic case, HN    2, from January 2010, which was
closely related to Taiwan/143 from September 2009 and Nor-
way/3797 from October 2009 (PP  0.63), as well as to New
York/6806 from December 2009 (not included in the tree).
Phylogenetic analysis of the NA gene showed that the Ar-
gentinean samples were distributed in the same clade repre-
senting the                    group with I106 and D248
(data not shown).
Phylogenetic analysis of the N-4 fragments showed that
there were 27 different nucleotide variants circulating during
the period analyzed and that they were represented by the
oldest sequence in the group (data not shown). The main
group was represented by isolate HN    01 from 27 May
2009 and had 125 identical sequences, and variants from this
group were still detected 87 days after the end of the outbreak
(27 August 2009). The second group had 10 identical se-
quences, and variants from this group were detected from 19
June 2009 to 10 July 2009 (22 days); the third group had 9
identical sequences, and variants from this group were de-
tected from 20 June 2009 to 8 July 2009 (19 days); the fourth
group had 6 identical sequences, and variants from this group
were detected from 22 June 2009 to 30 June 2009 (8 days); the
fifth group had 2 identical sequences, and variants from this group
were detected only on 24 June 24 2009; the sixth group had 2
identical sequences, and variants from this group were detected
from 25 June 2009 to 10 July 2009 (10 days); and the seventh
group had 3 identical sequences, and variants from this group
were detected from 26 June 2009 to 30 June 2009 (4 days). There
were 19 other unique variants that were detected once during the
peak of the outbreak (June and July). Among these, the virus in
five samples showed oseltamivir resistance (Fig. 4).
The MRCA of Buenos Aires H1N1pdm, calculated from the
HA full-length sequences, was detected from 9 May to 26 May
2009 (95% highest probability density [HPD]), 2 weeks before
our first local detection of isolate HN     (27 May 2009), and
had a mean nucleotide substitution rate of 3.58  105
nucle-
otides (nt)/site/day. When the same analysis was performed
with 174 sequences of the N-4 segment from the NA gene, the
MRCA was detected from 17 May to 9 June 2009 (95% HPD).
These results suggest that the virus was circulating in our
country only 1 or 2 weeks prior to our first detection. In
addition, the mean substitution rate of the last region was
4.35  105
nt/site/day, on the same order as that for the HA
gene.

NA H275Y oseltamivir resistance screening. A total of 291
out of the 330 H1N1pdm-positive samples were suitable for re-
sistance screening by Sanger sequencing, pyrosequencing, or
both.
Oseltamivir-resistant variant H275Y was found in five pa-
tients. The 50% inhibitory concentration values for these re-
sistant samples were measured, rendering mean values of
61.54  32.89 nM (range, 13.82 to 97.93 nM), while sensitive
samples showed values of 0.27  0.04 nM.
Mutation N295S, also known to alter oseltamivir suscepti-
bility, was found in the direct sequencing of N-4 from sample
HN    02 (5).
Viral replication kinetics. On the basis of the whole-genome-
sequence polymorphism analysis detailed above, we analyzed if
there were phenotypic differences between oseltamivir-resistant
and oseltamivir-sensitive strains, as well as between strains from
mild and fatal cases, by assessing the viral replication kinetics.
As regards the growth of oseltamivir-sensitive and oseltami-
vir-resistant strains, we observed that the titer of the resistant
strain (HN    ) was 100-fold lower than that of the sensitive
one (HN    ) in the first 24 h postinfection. Nevertheless,
after 36 h both growth curves reached the same titers. With
regard to this point, we verified that the resistant strain main-
tained the H275Y replacement at 72 h postinfection in MDCK
cells. Moreover, the plaque area of the resistant strain was
smaller than that of the sensitive one (Fig. 5).
In the case of mild versus fatal cases, we compared four
strains: three from fatal cases (HNRG5, HN    , and
HN    2) and one from a mild case (HN    ). Strains
HN     and HNRG5 showed a pattern of increased growth
compared to that of strains HN     and HN    2. Whole-
genome analysis of the strains from fatal cases showed major
changes in PA, PB2, PB1, and NEP (nuclear export protein
[NS2]). Besides, the plaque area of the strains from fatal cases
was smaller than that of the strain from the mild one (Fig. 5).
In addition, we performed a viral growth assessment of
strains which represent the outbreak timeline (HNRG isolates
14, 42, 49, 66, and 72) without major clinical distinctive char-
acteristics. Although minor genetic differences were found
among them (Fig. 2), all the strains had a similar increased
viral growth pattern in relation to the pattern from strains from
fatal cases, which showed impaired growth and a small plaque
phenotype (data not shown). Some of these, including the
resistant strains, arose once and did not persist over time in the
N-4 timeline distribution (Fig. 4).
DISCUSSION
Given the time course of the pandemic and due to the high
seasonality and transmissibility of influenza viruses, Argentina
might have played an important role in raising and spreading
strains. As the emergence of H1N1pdm overlapped with the
southern hemisphere annual peak of respiratory virus infec-
tions, climate and social conditions might have been an optimal
source to generate new variants without restraints. In fact, in
our hospital, H1N1pdm predominated over other viruses that
regularly occur in winter, such as HPIV and HAdV. Neverthe-
less, in children under 5 years of age, bronchiolitis caused by
HRSV remained predominant both in our setting and in the
entire country (73.54% for HRSV versus 21.25% for other

other viruses, respectively) (21).
Our study mainly focused on pediatric cases with different
outcomes from the most populated city in Argentina and one
of the hospitals in Buenos Aires where patients are most often
referred. This is relevant, considering that children less than 5
years of age were the age group most affected by fatal or severe
H1N1pdm infection in Argentina (rate, 76.41/100,000 citizens)
(21). We found that 16/330 patients with confirmed H1N1pdm
infection died, regardless of their underlying condition. Other
research groups in our country have analyzed the situation in
pediatric intensive care units and reported mortality rates
ranging from 5 to 50% (3, 17). Considering our previous
records for seasonal FluAV infection in the last 5 years, there
was a marked increase in the rate of mortality from H1N1pdm
infection in the 2009 season (P. R.               , unpublished
data).
We analyzed three main components of the viral particle,
namely, the HA, NA, and M genes, in 37 isolates. This com-
bination was found to be essential when an attempt was made
to evaluate multiple sources of diversity. We detected some
discordance in diagnostic procedures that might be relevant in
the viral landscape. A total of 14 discordances were found at
the qRT-PCR level by evaluating the NP gene for universal
swine virus and the HA gene of swine H1 virus. Although these
changes might have affected the NP or HA gene, other com-
pensatory mutations cannot be ruled out. As an example, we
found a nonconservative change in the polymorphic site D239
in an isolate with a nonconclusive result by qRT-PCR
(HNRG8). These findings have to be monitored closely in
order to have up-to date diagnostic tools and to rapidly eval-
uate newly emerging variants.
The complete-genome phylogenetic analysis of the 21 Ar-
gentinean H1N1pdm isolates revealed that they were clustered
together and had sequences that defined them to be members
of clade 7, a globally distributed group of isolates. Therefore,
the possibility of multiple introductions before local dissemi-
nation cannot be ruled out. In addition, two coupled oseltami-
vir-sensitive and -resistant strains clustered together, and two
strains from fatal cases clustered alone, while the rest of the
strains from fatal cases were mixed into the data set.
The phylogenetic analyses of the full length of the HA and
NA genes also related Argentinean sequences to clade 7 se-
quences from the rest of the world. The HA analysis revealed
that the Argentinean strains, isolated mostly in July 2009, clus-
tered with samples from the northern hemisphere autumn-
winter from September to December 2009, thus suggesting
evolutionary convergence or exportation of viruses and show-
ing that viruses might be circulating in waves chasing winters,
as suggested by                in 2008 (26). Moreover, we
found that strain HN    2 from a sporadic case from January
2010 was also related to similar strains, probably suggesting a
new introduction of the virus in our country without evidence
of local spread.
Genetic and phylogenetic analyses of the N-4 fragment
showed that a major consensus sequence dominated the viral
landscape from the beginning to the end of the outbreak,
probably as a result of previous selection phenomena. Never-
theless, many other attempts to generate new variants have
been detected, but they lasted for only a short period and were
discarded by purifying selection. That was the case for the
oseltamivir-resistant variants that arose at least three times in
different locations but that may have not been fit enough to
spread in the entire population. In this study, we showed that
there were fixed replacements that appeared in all samples as
well as diversity attempts that did not persist by means of
hierarchical sample clustering and direct sequencing of N-4
from NPAs.
The MCRAs for HA and N-4 were dated 6 and 17 May 2009,
respectively, and clearly overlapped the date when local circu-
lation was first reported, on 17 May 2009 (20). As far as we
were able to test, the HA and NA genes seem to have highly
similar mutation rates and might be coevolving, thus minimiz-
ing the possibility of emergence of new reassortants.
The switch from low-circulation imported cases to high-
circulation local cases resulted in a change in palliative regu-
lations and practices on 24 June 2009, at the peak of the
epidemic. At that time, empirical treatment with oseltamivir
was indicated for every hospitalized child with influenza-like
symptoms, groups at higher risk, and close contacts of con-
firmed cases (20). Nevertheless, it seems that the massive an-
tiviral therapy application leads to the advent of resistant
strains in both at-risk and previously healthy patients. It is
noteworthy that we found that five patients presented with
oseltamivir-resistant variant H275Y and that one patient pre-
sented with the N295S mutation. These mutants might have
been favored by the high degree of selective pressure and thus
resulted in virus more fit to survive in this modified environ-
ment over a short period (32). However, to the best of our
knowledge, these resistant strains did not show person-to-per-
son transmission; therefore, compensating mutations occurring
elsewhere in their genomes that might improve their fitness
and transmissibility need further study.
The growth differences between the oseltamivir-sensitive
and oseltamivir-resistant strains in cell culture were mainly
found in the first 24 h, when the initial setting of the natural
infection occurs, and might show that sensitive strains have a
clear advantage over resistant ones, as the former are the
viruses occurring most frequently in the natural environment.
This might explain the lack of spread of resistance to the whole
population so far. Furthermore, we showed that the resistance
was maintained in cell culture in the absence of oseltamivir
pressure, as is known to occur for seasonal H1N1 influenza
virus strains with an adequate genetic backbone (2). In addi-
tion, the smaller plaque phenotype of the resistant strain might
show that it has an impaired neuraminidase activity that dis-
abled the normal spread of the resistant viruses to the vicinity.
Our study shows that two different strains that were isolated
from the same patient (namely, oseltamivir-sensitive and osel-
tamivir-resistant strains) had markedly different growth kinet-
ics and plaque phenotypes. This might be supported by re-
placements at the whole-genome level that improve and/or
impair viral growth or function as compensative changes to
restore or reinforce their fitness. In our example, the sensitive
strain had HA A232S and PB1 H47N, whereas the resistant
strain had only HA S457L at HA2 position 108.
Except for strain HNRG5, strains from fatal cases also
showed impaired growth and the small plaque phenotype. In
particular, HNRG5 showed the unique NEP replacement
N92S. Changes in this residue have been shown to make H1N1

human virus highly virulent in pigs (29) and have been associ-
ated with increased resistance to interferon (18). The isolate
from a sporadic fatal case, HN    2, had the highly virulent
K22R mutation in PA in association with HA D239G and
E391K. The former HA replacement has been related to se-
vere outcomes in Europe and Asia, whereas the latter has been
associated with increased spread and H1N1pdm vaccination
failure, as it is located in HA2 position 47, known to strength
the interaction between the HA monomers and to bear a
highly conserved epitope recognized by antibodies that neu-
tralize the closely related 1918 H1N1 virus (19).
As the first detected case of local spread, the nonfatal
HN     virus had the unique PA R531K replacement that
was not conserved over time. For HN    , there were no
additional mutations; therefore, whether the severity of the
disease was related to host immune failure has to be further
evaluated.
The recent H1N1 pandemic was not only a threat but also a
challenge both for the scientists and for the community, in
terms of preparedness of human resources, detection tools,
and awareness to investigate and fight emerging viruses appro-
priately. In Argentina, H1N1pdm circulation decreased and
ceased in spring and summer, and the molecular surveillance
system is prepared to monitor resistance and viral dynamics in
the following winter.
