Each year, influenza viruses cause epidemics by evading pre-existing humoral immunity through
mutations in the major glycoproteins: the haemagglutinin (HA) and the neuraminidase (NA). In
2004, the antigenic evolution of HA of human influenza A (H3N2) viruses was mapped (Smith
et al., Science 305, 371­376, 2004) from its introduction in humans in 1968 until 2003. The
current study focused on the genetic evolution of NA and compared it with HA using the dataset
of Smith and colleagues, updated to the epidemic of the 2009/2010 season. Phylogenetic trees
and genetic maps were constructed to visualize the genetic evolution of NA and HA. The results
revealed multiple reassortment events over the years. Overall rates of evolutionary change were
lower for NA than for HA1 at the nucleotide level. Selection pressures were estimated, revealing
an abundance of negatively selected sites and sparse positively selected sites. The differences
found between the evolution of NA and HA1 warrant further analysis of the evolution of NA at the
phenotypic level, as has been done previously for HA.
INTRODUCTION
Influenza epidemics affect approximately 5­15 % of the
world population, resulting in an estimated 3­5 million
hospitalizations and between 250 000 and 500 000 deaths
annually (Sto
¨hr, 2002; WHO, 2003). Influenza type A
viruses can be divided into subtypes based on the antigenic
properties of the major surface glycoproteins, haemagglu-
tinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). To date, 17 HA
(Fouchier et al., 2005; Tong et al., 2012) and nine NA
(Schild et al., 1980) subtypes have been found in nature.
Subtypes A (H1N1) and A (H3N2) are currently the
causative agents of influenza A virus epidemics in humans,
of which the influenza A (H3N2) viruses are the most
recurring and virulent (Barr et al., 2010; Taubenberger &
Morens, 2006) and show the strongest antigenic drift
(Rambaut et al., 2008).
HA, a homotrimeric type I integral membrane protein,
mediates viral entry into the cell by binding to sialic acids
(Sauter et al., 1989). NA, a tetrameric type II integral
membrane protein with sialidase activity, allows virus
release from the cell (Liu et al., 1995; Palese & Compans,
1976; Palese et al., 1974). Both HA and NA are located on
the surface of the viral membrane and are the main targets
for antibodies. Antibodies against influenza viruses result
in protective immunity, but mutations in HA and NA
allow the virus to escape host immunity. This process,
known as antigenic drift (Schild et al., 1974), is responsible
for the recurrence of influenza epidemics almost every
winter.
Vaccines have proven effective but need to be updated
frequently due to antigenic drift. Since 1999, the influenza
A (H3N2) virus component has been updated six times
(Barr et al., 2010). Thorough surveillance by the National

Influenza Centers and WHO Collaborating Centers within
the World Health Organization's Global Influenza Surveil-
lance Network is required to identify the most suitable
strains to use in vaccines for the next epidemic (Barr et al.,
2010; Russell et al., 2008). Vaccine strain selection depends
on three aspects: epidemiological information, HA and NA
gene sequence phylogeny and serological analysis using an
HA inhibition assay. The main focus of genetic and
antigenic surveillance is on HA, and official influenza
vaccine formulations prescribe the amount of HA (Fiore
et al., 2010).
Although antibodies against NA do not prevent infection,
numerous pre-clinical and clinical studies indicate a role of
NA immunity in reducing the severity of influenza virus
infection (Brett & Johansson, 2005; Couch et al., 1974;
Johansson et al., 1993; Kilbourne, 1976; Murphy et al.,
1972; Schulman et al., 1968). Early crystallographic studies
of NA have shown that antigenic regions surround the
enzyme's highly conserved active site (Colman et al., 1983,
1987). Antigenic sites A, B and C (Air et al., 1985) have
been shown to be highly variable, probably due to antigenic
drift (Laver et al., 1982; Luther et al., 1984). Studies
comparing the antigenic drift of HA and NA using limited
numbers of viruses have revealed that their evolution
differs and is often asynchronous (Kilbourne et al., 1990;
Sandbulte et al., 2011; Schulman & Kilbourne, 1969).
Given these factors, understanding the patterns of evolu-
tion in NA is important.
In 2004, Smith et al. (2004) mapped the antigenic evolu-
tion of HA of human influenza A (H3N2) virus from its
introduction in humans in 1968 until 2003. The study was
based on an extensive dataset, comprising influenza virus
isolates obtained within each influenza season. Here, we
focused on the genetic evolution of NA and compared it
with HA1 (the immunogenic section of the HA) using the
dataset of Smith et al. (2004), updated to the epidemic
of the 2009/2010 season. Reassortment events, rates of
evolutionary change and selection pressures were analysed
over 40 years of influenza A (H3N2) virus evolution. The
differences found between the evolution of NA and HA1
warrant further analysis of the antigenic properties of NA.
RESULTS
Dataset background
Virus isolates obtained between 1968 and 2003 and used in
the study of Smith et al. (2004) were combined with 19
influenza A (H3N2) viruses isolated between 2003 and
2009 into a single updated dataset consisting of 291 virus
isolates. The new isolates included seven vaccine or
reference strains and 12 isolates from epidemics in the
Netherlands, of which the latter were chosen based on
divergent placement in the updated influenza A (H3N2)
antigenic map (de Jong et al., 2011). All NA gene segments
of these 291 viruses were sequenced. For the study by Smith
et al. (2004), only the HA1 coding regions were sequenced,
as this is the immunogenic section of the HA protein
(Wiley et al., 1981; Wilson & Cox, 1990). To obtain a
similar dataset for HA and NA, the HA1 coding regions of
the 19 recent influenza viruses were sequenced. Deduced
amino acid sequence alignments showing only positions
with at least one mutation are available in Figs S1 and S2
for NA and HA1, respectively (available in JGV Online).
Both alignments were colour coded according to the
antigenic clusters of HA (Smith et al., 2004).
Genetic evolution of NA and HA1
Maximum-likelihood (ML) phylogenetic trees were con-
structed to observe the genetic evolution of NA and HA1,
updated from 2004, at the nucleotide level (Fig. 1). The
general topology of the NA tree was similar to that of
the HA1 tree, showing the typical `ladder-like' gradual
evolution with rapid replacement of old strains by newer

ones. NA had fewer nucleotide substitutions over 40 years
of evolution compared with HA1; overall, the genetic
distance from the root of the tree to the most recent cluster
of CA04 strains was roughly 1.5-fold greater for HA1 than
for NA. Although we did see that variants on the trunk
were the ancestors of all variants in future years (Fitch et al.,
1997), the HA1 phylogeny did have some variants that
clustered away from the trunk in an evolutionary terminal
or dead-end clade, most notably for the VI75- and the
BE89-like viruses. Compared with HA1, such dead-end
clades were less obvious in the NA tree. For NA, the most
obvious ­ yet relatively small ­ evolutionary dead-end
clades included a number of the SY97- and BE92-like
viruses. Whilst the HA genes of the VI75-like and BE92-like
viruses clustered continuously in the ML tree, the NA genes
appeared as two separate lineages for both groups of
viruses. Notably, the NA genes of HK68-like viruses were
more genetically divergent than HA1 (0.044403 vs 0.03556
nucleotide substitutions per site, respectively). Larger
genetic distances were found between BK79- and SI87-like
viruses and within the SY97-like viruses for NA compared
with HA1. In contrast, the distances between EN72- and
VI75-, between TX77- and BK79-, and between SY97- and
FU02-like viruses were greater for HA1.
Genetic maps were generated to visualize the genetic
evolution of NA at the amino acid level (Fig. 2a). The HA1
genetic map was updated with the newly added isolates
(Fig. 2b). In Fig. 2(c), the two maps are compared with
arrows that point from the position of a virus in the HA1
map to the position of the corresponding virus in the NA
map. Overall, the genetic map of the NA appeared less
clustered and more gradual compared with the HA1
genetic map. Although the genetic clustering of strains
based on HA1 amino acid sequences was in good agree-
ment with the antigenic properties of the HA proteins as
described previously (Smith et al., 2004), the NA amino
acid sequences did not strictly follow the same pattern of
clustering. Other features of the NA genetic map, including
the less pronounced evolutionary dead ends (yellow and

the HA1 and NA maps was chosen to match the orientation of the antigenic map of human influenza A (H3N2) viruses (Smith
et al., 2004). The colour coding of viruses is based on the antigenic clusters of HA and is consistent among all maps (see

differences in genetic distance within and between clusters
compared with HA1, were in agreement with the ML trees.
Reassortment events
In 2005, Holmes et al. (2005) demonstrated for a limited
number of influenza seasons that multiple lineages of
influenza A (H3N2) viruses co-circulate, persist and rea-
ssort in epidemiologically significant ways. By applying the
antigenic cluster colours of HA (Smith et al., 2004) to both
the HA1 and NA trees, it was noted that the clusters of NA
sequences did not strictly coincide with those of HA (Fig.
1). The HA1 and NA trees shown in Fig. 1 were used in
TreeMap to generate a tanglegram. A tanglegram enables
visualization of the location of particular isolates within
both ML trees. In the absence of reassortment, the twines
should connect both trees, in theory, in a seamlessly
horizontal way. This was not the case for the isolates used
in this study, suggesting frequent reassortment between the
NA and HA gene segments. However, this was based on
only one phylogeny per gene segment, with clades and
branches ordered by branch length in a fixed fashion. To
improve on this, the computational software package
Graph-incompatibility-based Reassortment Finder (GiRaF)
was used to identify reassortments in multiple trees per
gene segment (Nagarajan & Kingsford, 2011). This method
compares large collections of Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC)-sampled trees for groups of incompatible splits
to identify sets of taxa with differential phylogenetic
placement, whilst accounting for uncertainties in the
inferred phylogenies. We performed 100 independent
GiRaF analyses on ten independent MrBayes HA runs
compared with ten independent MrBayes NA runs. Each run
consisted of two independent tree files each with 1000
MCMC-sampled trees. GiRaF removed the first 500 of these
trees as burn-in, and the remaining 500 were used for the
actual analysis. All reassortment events are reported in Table
S1 and those with a support value of ¢50 % of the GiRaF
runs are depicted on the tanglegram made from the ML trees
as bold twines (Fig. 3). A 50 % cut-off was chosen arbitrarily.
For the HK68-like viruses, two possible reassortment
events were reported with 58 and 52 % support of the
GiRaF runs (Fig. 3 and Table S1; events 1 and 2, respec-
tively). There was no evidence for reassortment during the
circulation of the EN72-like viruses with support from
GiRaF of ¢50 %. The VI75-like viruses in the HA1 tree
formed one clade, which descended from EN72-like
viruses, and this clade formed the common ancestor to
TX77-like viruses. In the NA tree, the VI75-like viruses
were divided into two clades. The two different clades
represented two different influenza seasons. The first clade,
comprising viruses isolated in 1975 and early 1976, was
directly descended from EN72-like viruses, similar to the
HA tree. In contrast, the second clade, consisting of strains
isolated in early 1977, originated, together with the TX77-
like viruses, from late EN72-like viruses. The viruses
containing the NA of the second clade were reassortants,
with a reported support of 71 % of the GiRaF runs (event
3). GiRaF provided no support for reassortment between
HA and NA during circulation of the TX77-like viruses.

Evolution of human H3N2 virus NA
http://vir.sgmjournals.org 1999
The BK79-like strain A/Philippines/2/1982 was a reported
reassortment event with 93 % support (event 4). Two
strains with very different HAs, one BK79- and the other
SI78-like, both contained a closely related NA and were
identified as reassortants in 80 % of the runs (event 5). A/
Hong Kong/1/1989, with an intermediate SI87-like HA and
an NA that clustered with early SI87-like viruses, was also
reported as a reassortant (event 6, 90 %). Multiple rea-
ssortment events included BE92-like viruses, and five out
of 14 were supported by ¢50 % of the GiRaF reports
(events 8 and 10­13). The most notable observation was
that the BE92-like viruses were divided into two clades in
the NA tree, one descending from SI87-like viruses and the
second one from BE89-like viruses. The upper clade
included viruses circulating from late 1991 until mid-
1993, whilst the second clade contained viruses circulating
from late 1992 until early 1996.
The first isolate of the second BE92 clade and everything
descending from it were all reported as a single reassort-
ment event supported by 98 % of the GiRaF runs (event 7).
A similar event was reported for a more recent BE92-like
virus and all its descendants, although with weaker support
(event 9, 80 %). Both reports suggest that, at some point
during the influenza season of 1992/1993, an NA was
introduced by reassortment that represents the common
ancestor of the more recent NAs.
Multiple reassortment events were reported by GiRaF with-
in and between the BE92 and WU95 clusters. Clustering of
BE92- and WU95-like viruses appeared scattered in both
trees, but when comparing these scattered clades between
the NA and HA tree, a number of clades positioned dif-
ferently. Three reassortment events that were supported by
¢50 % of the runs included a mixture of BE92- and
WU95-like viruses (events 14­16). During circulation of
the more recent WU95-like viruses, four reassortment
events were supported by ¢50 % of the GiRaF runs (events
17­20). One reassortment event involving SY97-like
viruses was supported by GiRaF ¢50 % (event 21, 89 %).
For FU02-like viruses, only one reassortant was reported
(event 22, 81 %). Reassortment of HA and NA of CA04-
like viruses was not supported at ¢50 % by GiRaF.
Thus, visual inspection of a single NA tree and a single HA1
tree within the tanglegram suggested numerous reassortment
events. Inference from multiple MCMC-sampled trees
provided support for a portion of these events, using an
arbitrary cut-off of 50 %. Overall, these data indicated that,
although mostly singular, reassortment events have occurred
throughout the evolution of human influenza A (H3N2)
viruses, especially during the periods of circulation of BE92-
and WU95-like viruses. Most reassortment events were
within antigenic clusters, rather than between antigenic
clusters. There were 13 reassortment events within the same
HA antigenic group (events 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10­13 and 17­20).
There were six reassortment events involving strains from
different HA groups (events 5, 7, 9 and 14­16). Event 3
included only VI75-like strains, but the NAs originated from
late EN72-like viruses instead of descending from VI75-like
viruses. Event 21 contained an NA derived from WU95-like
viruses and an HA descending from SY97-like viruses.
Reassortment event 22 was a FU02-like strain, although the
NA of this virus originated from SY97-like viruses. Whereas
most reassortants were not detected during prolonged
periods, possibly suggesting that the reassortment events
were neutral or detrimental, two reassortment events (events
7 and 9) persisted in the population.
Evolutionary rates
Rates of nucleotide substitution and time of the most recent
common ancestor (MRCA) for NA and HA1 were estimated
using BEAST version 1.6.2 with the relaxed log-normal clock
and the Bayesian skyride time-aware model (Table 1).
The mean rates of nucleotide substitution for NA and
HA1 were 3.1561023
(HPD 2.8161023
­3.4961023
) and
5.1561023
(HPD 4.6261023
­5.7061023
) nucleotide sub-
stitutions per site per year, respectively. The time of MRCA
was 1965.10 (HPD, 1962.82­1967.10) for NA and 1967.00
(HPD, 1966.18­1967.73) for HA1.
Selection pressures
The degree of natural selection acting on NA and HA1 was
estimated by looking at the mean number of amino acid-
changing (non-synonymous or dN) and silent (synonym-
ous or dS) substitutions per site (dN/dS ratio) using
Codeml. The overall dN/dS and the mean dN/dS ratios for
the internal and external branches were estimated (Table
2). Both genes were under strong selection (NA dN/dS

50.249 and HA1 dN/dS50.362); however, HA1 was less
constrained. The dN/dS values for the internal and external
branches were similar for NA (0.250 and 0.248) and HA1
(0.350 and 0.371), suggesting no difference between
selection pressures on NA and HA1. In theory, a higher
dN/dS value for the external relative to the internal branches
indicates an excess of non-synonymous mutations that are
eventually removed from the virus population by purifying
selection, suggesting that these mutations are deleterious
(Pybus et al., 2007). This was not the case for NA and HA1.
To determine the positively and negatively selected sites
along internal branches only, where advantageous muta-
tions are more likely to fall, the internal fixed effects
likelihood (IFEL) method was used (Kosakovsky Pond
et al., 2006). IFEL detected three positively selected sites in
NA: codons 43, 267 and 370 (Table S2). In HA1, nine
positively selected sites were reported, all located in anti-
genic sites (Table S3).
Sites subject to episodic diversifying selection were iden-
tified using mixed effects model of evolution (MEME)
(Kosakovsky Pond et al., 2011). MEME detected five sites
(codons 43, 148, 199, 338 and 465) in NA (Table S2) and
14 in HA1 (Table S3), of which all but two (codons 31 and
185) were found in antigenic sites.
Directional positive selection was detected with the direc-
tional evolution in protein sequences (DEPS) test imple-
mented in the HyPhy package (Kosakovsky Pond et al.,
2005). The DEPS test identifies directional evolution
towards residues at sites within an amino acid alignment
in combination with a nucleotide tree and is particularly
useful for the detection of selective sweeps (Kosakovsky
Pond et al., 2008). For NA, 11 sites (Tables S2 and S4) were
identified to be involved in this directional evolution (see
Table S4 for the inferred amino acid substitution pat-
terns). For HA1, nine sites were involved (Tables S3 and
S5). In contrast, this method detected more sites under
directional selection in NA compared with HA1 (11 and
nine sites, respectively).
The positively selected sites within HA1 (Table S3) were
found mainly in the antigenic sites of HA1 (with two
exceptions). One site, namely 145, was detected by all three
methods. Residues 31, 133, 135, 137, 159, 186, 193, 226 and
262 were found by two of the methods. For the positively
selected sites found by the IFEL, MEME and DEPS
analyses, it was noted that only a few were within antigenic
sites of NA (Table S2, residues 199, 328, 334, 338, 367 and
370). All positively selected sites are indicated in the NA
monomeric and tetrameric protein diagrams shown in Fig.
4(a) and (b), respectively. Fig. S3 depicts ML trees coloured
by each positively selected site found by at least two
methods.
The transition of codon 43 from an aspartic acid to a serine
occurred around the time of the cluster transition from
TX77 to BK79. The change of serine to an asparagine at
position 43 corresponded with the emergence of the BE89
cluster and all descending viruses. The change of arginine
to leucine at position 338 correlated roughly with the
transition from BE92 to WU95. The changes at position
370 from leucine to serine and from serine back to leucine
did not correspond with antigenic cluster transitions for
HA, as they occurred during the continued circulation of
the HK68-like and BK79-like strains, respectively. The late
leucine-to-serine substitution correlated roughly with the
FU02 to CA04 transition.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we compared the genetic evolution of NA of
291 human influenza A (H3N2) viruses sampled between
1968 and 2009 with that of HA1. Although similarities were
apparent, the main observation was that HA and NA
exhibited clear differences in evolutionary genetics.
The general topology of the NA and HA1 trees were
similar, showing the typical `ladder-like' gradual evolution
with rapid replacement of old strains by newer ones, as
described previously for HA1 (Fitch et al., 1997). NA
evolved more slowly at the nucleotide level and more
gradually, with overall shorter branches and fewer and
smaller evolutionary dead-end clades. The genetic distances
between clades in the ML trees and in the genetic maps
for NA and HA1 were often discordant, suggesting an
asynchronous genetic evolution of the two genes. This
observation is in agreement with the reported asynchron-
ous evolution at the phenotypic level, with discordant
patterns of antigenic drift of HA and NA, as measured by
serological assays (Kilbourne et al., 1990; Sandbulte et al.,
2011; Schulman & Kilbourne, 1969).
Reassortment is a common feature in influenza viruses
(Webster et al., 1992). The Asian, Hong Kong and 2009
swine flu pandemics of 1957, 1968 and 2009, respectively,
all emerged following reassortment of swine, avian and/or
human influenza viruses (Scholtissek et al., 1978; Smith
et al., 2009). In addition to the emergence of pandemic
strains, it has been suggested that the emergence of
new virus lineages during seasonal epidemics of the past
decade may have been associated with reassortment events
(Holmes et al., 2005), perhaps resulting from improved
matching of the activity of HA and NA in relation to HA
antigenic change (Kaverin et al., 2000; Mitnaul et al., 2000;
Wagner et al., 2002). However, when amino acid substitu-
tions in the active sites of HA and NA were analysed, no
evidence for a `matched' evolution of HA and NA was

the catalytic site of NA (specifically at position 151) that
seemed to provide no increased fitness as their occurrences
were transient.
For our influenza A virus dataset spanning .40 years of
influenza A (H3N2) virus epidemics, differences in clu-
stering of HA and NA gene segments within phylogenetic
trees indeed suggested that reassortment events had
occurred relatively frequently over time. The large genetic
distances between NA sequences of the HK68-like viruses,
shown in both the phylogenetic ML tree (Fig. 1a) and the
genetic map (Fig. 2a), could be explained by a reassort-
ment event involving an early influenza A (H3N2) virus, in
which a heterologous N2 gene of H2N2 virus origin was
reintroduced (Lindstrom et al., 2004). Indeed, in an ML
tree generated with NA genes of all early influenza A
(H3N2) viruses and additional H2N2 strains, the NA of the
late H2N2 viruses clustered together with HK68-like
viruses of 1969 and 1970 (data not shown). GiRaF analyses
provided further support that several HK68-like strains
(A/Bilthoven/17938/1969, A/Bilthoven/2668/1970 and A/
Bilthoven/93/1970) were reassortants. Apart from these late
HK68-like strains, GiRaF provided evidence for reassort-
ment events between 1971 and 1977. Co-circulation of
antigenically distinct viruses has been reported in this
period (Kendal et al., 1978; Pereira & Chakraverty, 1977;
Schild et al., 1973), providing opportunities for such
reassortment events. In agreement with a previous study
(Xu et al., 1996), there was also support for reassortment
events between BE89- and BE92-like viruses. GiRaF analyses
further suggested that reassortment events between HA and
NA of influenza A (H3N2) viruses occurred particularly
frequently during the circulation of BE92- and WU95-like
viruses. It remains unclear whether the frequency of
reassortment events over time is significant and whether
these reassortment events have been of epidemiological
significance. Analyses with all genomic sequences would
provide us with a better insight into reassortment patterns.
Some concerns arise from the use of GiRaF in the intra-
H3N2-evolution context. The evolutionary distances sam-
pled in the present dataset are not the same as those GiRaF
was originally benchmarked against, and the performance
of GiRaF was shown to depend on the distance distri-
bution. Moreover, GiRaF seemed to perform slightly better
for single-taxa reassortments compared with larger events.
It should further be noted that the low false-positive rate of
GiRaF was only estimated on synthetic datasets assuming
neutral evolution models (Nagarajan & Kingsford, 2011).
Here, we used a tanglegram based on robust HA and NA
ML trees to visually inspect the results reported by GiRaF

as an independent test. The reassortment events reported
by GiRaF with .50 % support could all be confirmed by
visual inspection of the tanglegram. To test whether the
small genetic distances between the sets of HA and NA
sequences were problematic for GiRaF, we also ran GiRaF
on HA trees only (comparing one set of HA trees with
another set of HA trees) and on NA trees only, and using
alignments in which the HA and NA sequences were split
into half. One would not expect to detect any reassortment
events in these runs. GiRaF analysis reported only three
events for the 59HA­39HA analysis, and no reassortment
events for the analysis of 59NA­39NA, HA­HA and NA­
NA trees. Thus, we concluded from this that the 22 HA­
NA reassortment events reported in the present work are
supported by GiRaF and visual inspection.
The evolutionary rates of NA and HA1 were high (Hanada
et al., 2004; Jenkins et al., 2002) and of the expected level
for influenza viruses (Bhatt et al., 2011). The evolutionary
rate of NA of 3.15610­3
nucleotide substitutions per site
per year was slightly higher than a previously reported
rate (2.361023
; Xu et al., 1996). Although the rate of
nucleotide substitution of NA was lower than that of HA
(5.15610­3
nucleotide substitutions per site per year), it is
important to note that only HA1 was analysed here. As
HA1 is the most variable part of the HA gene, this part
would probably yield higher evolutionary rates than the full
HA gene (Bhatt et al., 2011).
The coalescent analyses revealed that the time of circula-
tion of the MRCA of both HA1 and NA of influenza A
(H3N2) viruses was around 1965 and 1967, respectively
(Table 1). As the 95 % HPDs for the MRCAs of both NA
and HA1 overlapped, it is likely that there was a single
seeding event for the 1968 pandemic, possibly prior to the
first recognition in 1968.
The overall mean dN/dS values of 0.249 (NA) and 0.362
(HA1) estimated by the PAML program (Table 2) were in
agreement with previously reported values (Chen &
Holmes, 2008). There was an abundance of negatively
selected sites and a limited number of positively selected
sites in both HA1 and NA (Tables 2, S2 and S3). Generally,
the number of positively selected sites was lower in NA
compared with HA1. In contrast, DEPS detected more sites
under directional selection in NA compared with HA1,
which suggests that positive selection in HA1 is more
random, or it could reflect toggling of antigenic sites due to
antibody pressure.
The positively selected codons 43, 46 and 52 are all located in
the highly variable stalk region (Blok & Air, 1982). Residue
199, detected by MEME, was reported previously as an
antigenic site (Gulati et al., 2002). Residue 267, detected by
IFEL, is not an antigenic site but has been reported pre-
viously as being positively selected (Kosakovsky Pond et al.,
2008). Two documented antigenic sites, 328 (Air et al., 1985)
and 334 (Air et al., 1985; Laver et al., 1982), were detected by
DEPS. Residue 370, a reported antigenic residue (Air et al.,
1985; Laver et al., 1982; Lentz et al., 1984), was found by
IFEL and DEPS as being positively selected. By IFEL, MEME
and DEPS, the number of positively selected sites found to
be within antigenic sites in NA was lower than in HA1.
In summary, we have analysed the evolutionary genetics of
NA of influenza A (H3N2) viruses isolated from 1968 to
2009 and compared them with those of HA. High-level
similarities were observed between the evolution of HA
and NA, although notable differences were apparent.
Future research on the evolution of NA should focus at
the phenotypic level, using serological tests and antigenic
cartography methods, as described recently (Kilbourne
et al., 1990; Sandbulte et al., 2011; Schulman & Kilbourne,
1969), on extensive virus datasets. Such analysis would
allow not only the side-by-side comparison of HA and NA
evolution at the genetic level as carried out here but also
its relationship with immune escape, the major driver of
evolution of the surface glycoproteins of influenza A virus.
Such analyses, along with full virus genome data,
ultimately may lead to a better understanding and
increased predictability of the evolution of influenza A
(H3N2) virus.
METHODS
Viruses. Human influenza A (H3N2) viruses, isolated over 35 years
of influenza virus surveillance between 1968 and 2003 that were used
in the study of Smith et al. (2004), served as the basis for this study.
Two viruses within this dataset were no longer available (A/Victoria/
7/87 and A/Netherlands/440/93) and were thus excluded from the
dataset. The dataset was updated with 19 influenza A (H3N2) viruses
circulating between 2003 and 2009, including seven vaccine or
reference strains and 12 isolates from epidemics in the Netherlands.
The latter 12 isolates were chosen based on divergent placement in the
updated A (H3N2) antigenic map (de Jong et al., 2011). This led to a
total of 291 human influenza A (H3N2) viruses. Human influenza A
(H3N2) viruses were propagated in Madin­Darby canine kidney
(MDCK) cells or, if unsuccessful, in 11-day-old embryonated chicken
eggs.
Sequence analysis. MDCK supernatant or allantoic fluid was used
for RNA extraction, using a High Pure RNA Isolation kit (Roche
Applied Science) and cDNA was synthesized with SuperScript III
reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The complete NA and HA1 gene
segments were amplified by PCR using AmpliTaq Gold DNA
polymerase (Applied Biosystems) and purified by gel extraction with
a QIAquick Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen). Sequencing was performed
with NA- or HA-specific primers using a BigDye Terminator Version
3.1 Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems) and a 3130 XL Genetic
Analyzer (Applied Biosystems), according to the instructions of the
manufacturer.
Nucleotide sequences of the NA ORFs and HA1 coding regions were
aligned using the CLUSTAL W program running within the BioEdit
software package, version 7.0.9.0 (Hall, 1999). Seven HA1 and 14 NA
sequences contained one or more degenerate nucleotide positions. In
all HA1 and ten of the 14 NA sequences, the degenerate nucleotide led
to degenerate amino acid positions. One NA sequence contained an
insertion of 3 nt between codons 221 and 222, and one sequence had
a 3 nt deletion at codon 154. Newly sequenced and previously
published NA and HA1 domain accession numbers are provided in
the Supplementary data.

Phylogeny. Nucleotide sequence alignments with or without an
additional outgroup (A/Duck/Hokkaido/33/80 for HA1 and A/Japan/
305/1957 for NA) were generated. With these nucleotide sequence
alignments, the best-fit models of nucleotide substitution were
determined by jModelTest (Posada, 2008). In all cases, the preferred
ML-optimized model of nucleotide substitution was TVM+I+C4
(transversion model with the proportion of invariant sites and the
gamma distribution of among-site rate variation with four categories
estimated from the empirical data) with GTR+I+C4 (general time-
reversible model) as second best based on the Akaike information
criterion (AIC).
As seven HA1 and ten NA nucleotide sequences contained degenerate
amino acid positions, either a B (aspartate or asparagine) or an X (any
amino acid) was applied at these positions. The best-fit models of
protein evolution were determined with ProtTest (Darriba et al.,
2011). The preferred ML-optimized model was HIVw+C4 (human
immunodeficiency virus within) for HA1 and HIVw+I+C4+F
(equilibrium amino acid frequencies estimated from the empirical
data) for NA based on the AIC.
Phylogenetic analysis. With the nucleotide sequence alignments,
initial ML trees were inferred using the PhyML package version 3.0
(Guindon & Gascuel, 2003), by means of a full heuristic search and the
subtree pruning and regrafting (SPR) method. As the TVM+I+C4
model of nucleotide substitution was not an option within the PhyML
package, the GTR+I+C4 model was chosen for all datasets. GARLI
version 0.951 (Zwickl, 2006) was run on the best nucleotide tree from
PhyML for 2 million generations to optimize tree topology and
branch lengths. Additionally, ML trees were estimated using the
TVM+I+C4 model of base substitution in combination with tree-
bisection-reconnection (TBR) searches using the PAUP* version 4.0b10
package (Swofford, 2003). For each of the trees, the reliability of all
phylogenetic groupings was determined through a non-parametric
bootstrap resampling analysis: either 500 replicates of ML trees using
the GTR+I+C4 model and the SPR method using PhyML, or 1000
replicates of neighbour-joining trees estimated under the ML
substitution model using PAUP*. All trees are available from the
authors upon request. Trees were visualized with the FigTree program
version 1.3.1 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/). Trees were
rooted on the outgroup strains (A/Duck/Hokkaido/33/80 for HA1
and A/Japan/305/1957 for NA) or on the 1968 pandemic strain (A/
Hong Kong/1/1968).
Amino acid alignments were used in combination with the
HIVw+C4 (HA1) or HIVw+I+C4+F (NA) model of protein
evolution to infer ML trees using the PhyML package version 3.0
(Guindon & Gascuel, 2003) by means of a full heuristic search and the
SPR method.
Genetic maps. Amino acid sequence alignments were used to
calculate a distance matrix with the number of amino acid sub-
stitutions between pairs of strains to produce `genetic maps', as
described previously (Smith et al., 2004). Genetic mapping is a way to
facilitate a quantitative analysis and visualization of genetic data. In a
genetic map, the distance between isolates A and B corresponds to the
number of amino acid substitutions between the amino acid
sequences of a particular protein-coding region of isolates A and B.
Thus, each difference in an amino acid alignment can be thought of as
specifying a target distance for the points in a genetic map. Modified
MDS methods are then used to arrange the points between two
isolates in a genetic map to best satisfy the target distances specified
by the amino acid alignment distance matrix. The result is a map in
which the distance between points represents the number of amino
acid substitutions in a particular protein-coding region between
isolates. To avoid underestimating genetic distances due to sequential
mutations at the same location, a threshold needs to be applied. For
example, when a threshold of 30 is applied to the alignment, the
software is free to use a distance of at least 30 aa between two points
that have a 30 aa difference in order to retrieve the lowest error
function. For HA1, the previously determined threshold of 30 was
used (Smith et al., 2004). Threshold considerations for NA were based
on adequate correlation between observed distances and genetic map
distances and sufficient correlation between ML amino acid tree
distances and genetic map distances. The threshold that approached
both considerations best for NA was 20 (data not shown). The
correlation between the number of amino acid substitutions and the
corresponding distances between strains in the genetic map was 0.93
(data not shown), indicating that the two-dimensional genetic map is
a reasonable representation of the target amino acid distance matrix.
For software, see http://www.antigenic-cartography.org.
Detection of reassortment. ML trees of NA and HA1 were used in
TreeMap version 1.0 (http://taxonomy.zoology.gla.ac.uk/rod/treemap.
html). TreeMap, originally designed for comparing host and parasite
trees, was applied solely to display a tanglegram between the HA and
NA phylogenies. The twines were colour coded according to the HA
antigenic clusters (Smith et al., 2004).
Reassortment events were identified by the GiRaF program
(Nagarajan & Kingsford, 2011). Nucleotide alignments of HA1 or
NA were used as input for MrBayes (Huelsenbeck & Ronquist, 2001;
Ronquist & Huelsenbeck, 2003) to sample 1000 unrooted candidate
trees with the GTR+I+C4 substitution model, a burn-in of 100 000
and sampling every 200 iterations. These trees were subsequently used
to model the phylogenetic uncertainty for each segment with the
GiRaF program under default settings. This procedure was repeated
100 times with ten independent MrBayes runs for NA and ten
independent MrBayes runs for HA1.
Estimation of nucleotide substitution rates and times of
divergence. To identify potential errors in sequence data annotation
that might affect the clock estimation, the ML nucleotide HA1 and
NA trees were exported to Path-O-Gen version 1.3 (http://tree.bio.ed.
ac.uk/software/pathogen; Drummond et al., 2003) and a linear
regression plot for the years of sampling versus root-to-tip distance
was generated (Fig. S4). No anomalies were seen in the NA and HA1
datasets, which both behaved in a clock-like manner (R2
50.977 and
R2
50.967, respectively).
Overall rates of evolutionary change (nucleotide substitutions per site
per year), MRCA in years and relative genetic diversity were estimated
using the BEAST program version 1.6.2 (http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/;
Drummond & Rambaut, 2007). For all analyses, the uncorrelated log-
normal relaxed molecular clock was used to accommodate variation
in molecular evolutionary rate among lineages in combination with
the SRD06 codon position model, with a different rate of nucleotide
substitution for the first plus second versus the third codon position,
and the HKY85 substitution model (Shapiro et al., 2006).
Isolation dates were added to calibrate the molecular clock. This
analysis was conducted with a time-aware linear Bayesian skyride
coalescent tree prior (Minin et al., 2008) over the unknown tree space,
with relatively uninformative priors on all model parameters. Two
independent Bayesian MCMC analyses, performed for HA1 and NA
for 100 million states, sampling every 1000 states, were performed.
Convergences and effective sample sizes of the estimates were checked
using Tracer version 1.5 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/)
and the first 10 % of each chain was discarded as burn-in. Uncertainty
in parameter estimates is reported as values of the 95 % HPD.
Selection pressures. To determine the degree of natural selection
acting on HA1 and NA, the mean number of dN and dS substitutions
per site (dN/dS ratio or v) was estimated using the `one-ratio' model
of the Codeml program implemented in the PAML package (Yang,
K. B. Westgeest and others
2004 Journal of General Virology 93
2007). Codeml uses the codon substitution model of Goldman &
Yang (1994) for protein-coding DNA sequences and was used in
combination with the ML tree rooted on A/Hong Kong/1/68.
Selection pressures on the internal and external branches of the
HA1 and NA ML tree were estimated with the `two-ratio' model of
the Codeml program.
To determine the positively and negatively selected sites along internal
branches, the IFEL method was used (Kosakovsky Pond et al., 2006).
Sites subject to episodic diversifying selection were identified using
MEME (Kosakovsky Pond et al., 2011). Both methods were accessed
through the Datamonkey interface (http://www.datamonkey.org) and
the GTR (HA1) or TVM (NA) nucleotide substitution model was
used. Sites with a P value ,0.05 were reported as positively selected
sites.
Directional positive selection was detected with the DEPS test
implemented in the HyPhy package (Kosakovsky Pond et al., 2005).
For this procedure, the ML trees with the A/Hong Kong/1/68
pandemic strain as outgroup were used in combination with the
amino acid alignment and the HIVw model of protein evolution.
Positively selected sites were show on the monomeric and tetrameric
NA structure constructed using MacPyMOL (PyMOL Molecular
Graphics System, version 13) on subtype N2 (PDB code 2BAT;
Varghese et al., 1992).
