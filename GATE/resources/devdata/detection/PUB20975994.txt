Abstract
Background: In Finland, the first infections caused by the 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus were identified on May
10. During the next three months almost all infections were found from patients who had recently traveled abroad. In
September 2009 the pandemic virus started to spread in the general population, leading to localized outbreaks and peak
epidemic activity was reached during weeks 43­48.
Methods/Results: The nucleotide sequences of the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes from viruses
collected from 138 patients were determined. The analyzed viruses represented mild and severe infections and different
geographic regions and time periods. Based on HA and NA gene sequences, the Finnish pandemic viruses clustered in four
groups. Finnish epidemic viruses and A/California/07/2009 vaccine virus strain varied from 2­8 and 0­5 amino acids in HA
and NA molecules, respectively, giving a respective maximal evolution speed of 1.4% and 1.1%. Most amino acid changes in
HA and NA molecules accumulated on the surface of the molecule and were partly located in antigenic sites. Three severe
infections were detected with a mutation at HA residue 222, in two viruses with a change D222G, and in one virus D222Y.
Also viruses with change D222E were identified. All Finnish pandemic viruses were sensitive to oseltamivir having the amino
acid histidine at residue 275 of the neuraminidase molecule.
Conclusions: The Finnish pandemic viruses were quite closely related to A/California/07/2009 vaccine virus. Neither in the
HA nor in the NA were changes identified that may lead to the selection of a virus with increased epidemic potential or
exceptionally high virulence. Continued laboratory-based surveillance of the 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) is important
in order to rapidly identify drug resistant viruses and/or virus variants with potential ability to cause severe forms of
infection and an ability to circumvent vaccine-induced immunity.

Introduction
In September 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO)
recommended to include the 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1)
virus as the H1N1 component of the trivalent, seasonal influenza
vaccine for the 2010 influenza season in the southern hemisphere.
In February 2010, the same recommendation was made for the
2010/2011 influenza season in the northern hemisphere. This
indicates that the world-wide circulation the 2009 pandemic
influenza A(H1N1) virus has not yet undergone significant antigenic
and genetic changes. This stability may be attributed to the lack of
pre-existing immunity in large segments of the global human
population. In serosurveys, particularly elderly individuals were
found to have pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies to the novel
pandemic virus that were likely derived from previous infection with
an antigenically related virus such as the Spanish influenza and its
immediate descendant viruses that were circulating in the early
decades of the 20th
century [1,2]. Continued surveillance for the
emergence of viruses with significant mutations is essential. Only a
few months into the pandemic, viruses resistant to oseltamivir had
been detected. In addition, a study from Norway indicated that an
amino acid change at residue 222 of the hemagglutinin molecule
may be associated with severe forms of disease [3].
The novel influenza A(H1N1) virus of swine-origin emerged in
humans in spring 2009. After initial reports from Mexico and the
United States (USA) the virus spread rapidly to many countries. In
Finland the first two infections caused by the 2009 pandemic
influenza A(H1N1) virus were identified on May 10 from two
individuals returning from Mexico. Between May and July 2009
nearly 90% of infections, and in August approximately 60% of
infections, the 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus was found
in individuals who had recently returned from abroad. During
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 October 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 10 | e13329
September the first local outbreaks were recorded in garrisons and
in schools in different parts of the country. In the beginning of
October, the virus started to spread efficiently in the general
population. Peak epidemic activity was reached late October and
early November in northern, and two weeks later in southern parts
of the country. Mid-December 2009 the first epidemic caused by
the novel H1N1 pandemic virus was practically over in Finland
(Figure 1).
Swift and open sharing of information on genetic and antigenic
characteristics of the novel virus enabled rapid development of
diagnostic procedures and laboratory-based surveillance throughout
the world. Even minor changes in the hemagglutinin molecule may
affect receptor binding specificity of the virus, and a single point
mutation in the neuraminidase may render the virus resistant to
oseltamivir. Continued surveillance and characterization of circulat-
ing viruses is crucial in order to identify the possible emergence of
drug resistant viral strains and viruses that show significant evolution
and may require the selection of future vaccine viruses. Here we
present data of the genetic characteristics of viruses circulating in the
Finnish population during the period from May 2009 until early
February 2010, when the so far latest single infections were found.
Results
A total of 141 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) viruses from 138
patients were analyzed in order to reveal genetic variation among
viruses that were identified in Finnish patients who either had
preceding travel history in countries where the 2009 pandemic
influenza A(H1N1) viruses were circulating (imported infections)
or who had been infected in Finland (domestic infections). Out of
the 141 viruses, 48 samples were imported infections from the
different continents including samples from North America
(n = 23), Europe (n = 13), South America (n = 5), Asia (n = 4) and
Australia and Oceania (n = 3). The remaining samples (n = 93)
were chosen from domestic infections. The imported strains
represented the early phases of the pandemic (May to July 2009),
while the domestic infections were mainly contracted at times
between August 2009 and February 2010.
Phylogenetic and molecular analysis of the
hemagglutinin (HA)
Based on the amino acid and the nucleotide sequence, the
Finnish pandemic viruses were closely related to each other and to
the A/California/07/2009 vaccine virus. In the HA1 region,
which contains all the major antigenic epitopes of the HA
molecule, the Finnish pandemic viruses differed from each other
by 0 to 6 amino acids (0 to 12 nucleotides). The difference between
Finnish pandemic viruses and the A/California/07/2009 virus
was from 2 to 5 amino acids (3 to 10 nucleotides). The
corresponding differences in the entire HA molecule were 0 to 8
amino acids (0 to 19 nucleotides) between Finnish pandemic
strains, and 2 to 8 amino acids (5­14 nucleotides) as compared to
the California vaccine virus.
The phylogenetic tree of HA1 nucleotide sequences of the
Finnish pandemic strains and the vaccine strain is shown in
Figure 1. Surveillance data from May 4, 2009 to June 20, 2010 in Finland. The weekly numbers of laboratory confirmed infections of the
2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) viruses reported to the National Infectious Disease Registry from week 19 in 2009 to week 24 in 2010.

Figure 2. The majority of the early, obviously imported viruses
appear at the base of the tree. The domestic strains evolved further
from the early imported strains and clustered into four groups
numbered as I to IV (Figure 2). No clear distribution of viruses
according to geographical or temporal occurrence could be
observed. Group II included, together with domestic strains,
viruses from the early phases of the pandemic, imported by
individuals with recent travel to Cyprus, Greece, Turkey and
Spain. Also viruses identified in patients suffering from severe or
fatal infections were scattered throughout the phylogenetic tree.
One of the characteristic differencies between the epidemic viruses
and the A/California/07/2009 vaccine virus occurred at residue
203, where only 10 of the analyzed viruses had this serine (S)
residue conserved. All other viruses had a change to threonine (T)
at this residue. In the HA1 region at residue 69, a change from
serine (S) to leucine (L) was identified in 3 viruses. The amino acid
change from aspartic acid (D) to glycine (G) at residue 222 was
found in two viruses and a corresponding change from aspartic
acid (D) to tyrosine (Y) at the same residue was found in one
additional virus. All these three changes, however, occurred as a
mixture of the new amino acid and conserved aspartic acid (D). In
16 viruses a change from aspartic acid (D) to glutamic acid (E) was
observed at residue 222, and these viruses form the group II in the
phylogenetic tree (Figure 2). A change from glutamine (Q) to
histidine (H) at residue 293 was found in three viruses identified in
patients who had returned from New York, Mexico, and
Thailand, respectively. Group III consisted of 14 viruses that
had an amino acid change from leucine (L) to methionine (M) at
residue 314. The majority of analyzed viruses (110/137) had an
amino acid change from isoleucine (I) to valine (V) at residue 321.
Viruses that have retained the isoleucine (I) at residue 321 form
group IV. In addition, an amino acid change from glutaminic acid
(E) to lysine (K) at residue 374 in the HA2 region was detected in
three viruses. Table 1 lists amino acid changes that may be
associated with severe disease outcome observed by us and others
[3,4,5,6]. The phylogenetic tree based on the entire HA gene
region is presented in supporting materials (Figure S1).
Figure 3 illustrates the amino acid changes between the Finnish
pandemic viruses and the vaccine virus in a three-dimensional
model of the HA molecule. Almost all amino acid changes on the
HA molecule were located on the surface of the molecule. Some of
the changes accumulated in antigenic sites, Ca1, Ca2, Cb, Sa and
Sb [7] and these viruses were derived from patients suffering both
mild or severe infections.
Phylogenetic and molecular analysis of the
neuraminidase (NA)
The NA of Finnish pandemic viruses differed from each other
by 0 to 7 amino acids (0­15 nucleotides), and from the A/
California/07/2009 virus by 0 to 5 amino acids (3­12 nucleo-
tides). In the phylogenetic tree of the NA gene (Figure 4), the
Finnish viruses cluster into the same four groups (Groups I­IV) as
in the HA tree. The only two exceptions were A/Finland/604/
2009 (imported from Bulgaria) and A/Finland/616/2009 (im-
ported from the United Kingdom). Both viruses were located in
Group IV of the NA phylogenetic tree, while they were at the basis
of the HA tree together with other viruses identified from early
imported infections. Viruses obtained from severe infections were
scattered throughout the phylogenetic tree of the NA gene. None
of the analyzed viruses had the amino acid change from histidine
(H) to tyrosine (Y) at residue 275, which would render the virus
resistant to oseltamivir. All 15 viruses of Group III had an amino
acid change from serine (S) to asparagine (N) at residue 95. Five

viruses clustered closely with the A/California/07/2009 virus,
which had a valine (V) at residue 106. This valine was changed to
isoleucine (I) in all other viruses. In addition, four of these five
viruses had asparagine (N) at residue 248 as in the vaccine virus,
while in all other viruses this amino acid was changed to aspartic
acid (D). Group I was characterized by a change from arginine (R)
to lysine (K) at residue 257.
In Figure 5, amino acid changes between the Finnish viruses
and the vaccine viruses are shown in a three-dimensional model of
the NA molecule. As in the HA, most amino acid changes were
located on the surface of the NA molecule and these changes cover
a considerable surface area of the molecule. Only three changes
were found in antigenic sites [8].
Glycosylation sites of the HA and NA molecules
Since glycosylation can potentially affect the antigenic proper-
ties of influenza A virus we analyzed the changes in the potential
N-linked glycosylation sites of the pandemic virus strains. Eight
potential N-glycosylation sites are found in the HA molecule of the
A/California/07/2009 virus, six of which reside in the HA1 and
the remaining two in the HA2 region. All but one of the Finnish
pandemic viruses had retained all the potential 8 N-glycosylation
sites. The one exception (A/Finland/583/2009) had lost a
glycosylation site with a change at amino acid residue 87 from
asparagine (N) to tyrosine (Y).
The A/California/07/2009 vaccine virus has 8 potential
glycosylation sites in its NA molecule. Altogether three viruses
showed changes in their potential N-glycosylation sites of the NA
molecule. A/Finland/659/2009 virus had lost a glycosylation site
(residues 68­70) by replacing a serine (S) at residue 70 by
asparagine (N) which, in turn, lead to the formation of a novel
potential N-glycosylation at residues 70 to 72 by changing the
sequence from SNT to NNT. Another virus (A/Finland/5/2010)
has lost a glycosylation site at residues 386­388, and in one
additional virus (A/Finland/636/2009) a ninth potential N-
glycosylation site was formed at position 364­366.

are shown in yellow and in the HA2 region in gold. Changes in antigenic sites are illustrated by the amino acid residue number, the amino acids that
have changed, and in addition, the number of viruses found to contain the respective amino acid (numbers in red denote severe infections).

Evolutionary rates of the HA and NA
Next we calculated the evolutionary rates of the HA and NA
genes. Figure 6 shows the number of nucleotide and amino acid
changes in the HA1 (Figure 6A) and NA (Figure 6B) as a function
of time. Viruses identified between May 2009 and February 2010
showed several nucleotide changes in their HA1 and the NA genes
as compared to the A/California/07/2009 vaccine virus. The first
viruses identified in Finland already showed 3 to 6 nucleotide
changes in the HA1 gene, and 3 to 4 nucleotide changes in the NA
gene as compared to the A/California/07/2009 virus. Thereafter
in Finnish strains nucleotide changes occurred linearly as a
function of time. The HA1 region accumulated 3­10 and the NA
gene 3­12 nucleotide changes, respectively. Since most of the
nucleotide changes in the HA1 and NA genes were silent, the rate
of amino acid changes was clearly lower than the changes at
nucleotide level. Data of the entire HA gene is presented in
supporting materials (Figure S2).
Characteristics of viruses from three severe clinical cases
Two subsequent clinical specimens were available from each of
three patients suffering from a severe form of infection due to the
pandemic virus. For two of these patients the outcome was fatal,
while one suffered from a severe pneumonia that required
intensive care and respirator treatment and lead to the recovery
of the patient. The two samples (A/Finland/624/2009 and A/
Finland/709/2009) from the first patient were taken 11 days
apart. In the HA1 region, the two viruses were identical, but they
differed by amino acid change from phenylalanine (F) to
phenylalanine/serine (F/S) mix at residue 397 in the HA2 region.
The two viruses from the second case (A/Finland/670/2009 and
A/Finland/671/2009) were taken 5 days apart from each other
and had identical HA1 and NA sequences. The specimens from
the third case (A/Finland/675/2009 and A/Finland/676/2009)
were taken 11 days apart and the viruses differed by two amino
acids in the HA, one of them in the signal peptide (N16T) region
and the other one in the HA1 region at residue 270 with a change
from threonine (T) to alanine (A).
Discussion
Based on nucleotide sequence data, viruses circulating in
Finland during the first 9 months after the emergence of the
novel 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus differed relatively
little from each other and from the A/California/07/2009 vaccine
strain. In the globular head region of the HA, the most varying
part of the molecule, homology at the amino acid level between
the Finnish pandemic strains ranged from 98.3% to 100%. In the
same region of the HA molecule, similarity between the Finnish
pandemic viruses and the California vaccine strain were between
98.5% and 99.4%. Corresponding homologies for the entire HA
region were 98.6%­100% among Finnish viruses, and 98.6%­
99.6% between Finnish pandemic viruses and the vaccine strain.
Also NA molecules were highly conserved. The Finnish pandemic
viruses were 98.5%­100% identical, and homologies between the
Finnish pandemic viruses and the California vaccine strain were
98.9% to 100%.
Some of the observed amino acid changes were located in the
critical antigenic sites (Figures 3 and 5) of the HA and NA
molecules. For some of the amino acid changes detected by us and
others [3,4,5,6] an association with severe illness may be assumed
(Table 1). The amino acid change from aspartic acid (D) to glycine
(G) at residue 222 of the HA1 was first reported for pandemic
H1N1 viruses from Norway [3]. This amino acid is located in the
antigenic site Ca2 in the immediate vicinity of the receptor binding
pocket and it may influence binding preferences of the virus
[9,10]. It has been speculated that the binding preference of the
2009 pandemic virus may change from the cells of the upper
respiratory tract to those found in lower parts of the lungs [10]. In
previous reports [3,11,12] as well as in our samples, this amino
acid change presented as a mixture between wild type virus and
mutated viruses. This amino acid change has previously been
associated with severe infection [3]. Similarly, in our study the two
viruses with D222G change and the virus with the D222Y change
were linked to severe or even fatal illness. Viruses with HA
molecule D222G, D222N, and D222E changes have been found
in many countries [13], but to our knowledge the D222Y amino
acid change has not yet been reported by others. Thus, the two
viruses with the D222G change represented 8.7% of the 23 severe

infections in the present study. As in the study by Kilander et al.
[3] this frequency reaches statistically significant level (p = 0.028).
Glinsky as well as Melidou and coworkers have found that
viruses with an amino acid change from glutamine (Q) to histidine
(H) at residue 293 may increase disease severity [4,5]. This
mutation was seen in viruses obtained from three of our patients.
However, all three patients suffered from a mild form of infection,
thus our analysis does not support the concept that Q293H
mutation is readily associated with a more severe form of infection.
The majority of viruses in our study (80.3%) had an amino acid
change from isoleucine (I) to valine (V) at residue 321 in the HA1.
This mutation has also frequently been observed in viruses isolated
in northern Greece where this change has been found in 93% of
the viruses analyzed [5]. In their study, some of the viruses that
retained the isoleucine were associated with severe influenza
infection. Accordingly, in our study eight of the 27 viruses that
exhibited isoleucine (I) at residue 321 were identified in patients
who had a severe illness. These viruses represent 34.8% of patients
who had severe or even fatal outcome of the illness, which,
however, does not quite reach statistical significance (p = 0.083).
The amino acid change from serine (S) to threonine (T) at residue
203 in the antigenic site Ca1 of the HA1 was found in over 90% of
the Finnish pandemic viruses, slightly more often as compared to
the Greek viruses [5]. Viruses identified in Singapore and
elsewhere showed an amino acid change from glutamic acid (E)
to lysine (K) at residue 374 in the HA2 region and this change was
associated with a more severe clinical picture in some patients. In
the same study it was speculated that this change could influence
the fusion properties of the HA molecule and thus may affect the
pathogenicity of the virus [6]. We found this mutation in 3 out of
127 viruses for which the entire HA sequence was obtained, one of
which was identified in a patient suffering from ARDS. In our
study, significant associations to severe illness could only be
demonstrated for the amino acid change to glycine at residue 222,
which is in agreement with the findings of Kilander et al [3].
During the first year of the pandemic, neuraminidase inhibitors
were liberally used especially in pregnant women or in patients
who suffered from a severe form of infection or who had an
underlying medical condition. Also in Finland oseltamivir was
actively used to treat influenza patients. None of the viruses
described in the present study had the amino acid change from
histidine (H) to tyrosine (Y) at residue 275 of the NA molecule, a
change that is commonly associated with resistance to oseltamivir.
The assumed three-dimensional structures of the HA and NA
molecules enabled us to map the amino acid changes found in our
viruses to the putative antigenic sites of the viral surface
glycoproteins. The HA structure of the Spanish influenza virus
A/South Carolina/1/18 and the NA structure of A/Brevig
Mission/1/1918 were used, since the corresponding HA and
NA genes are genetically the closest ones to the present pandemic
viruses [1]. The antigenic sites of H1 type HA molecule have been
well identified [7] (Figure 3A) and based on this data some of
mutations found in circulating Finnish pandemic influenza A virus
strains accumulated in the major antigenic sites. At present we do
not know which of the amino acid changes located in different
antigenic sites influence the formation of neutralizing or
hemagglutinin inhibiting antibodies. This is evidently a topic of
future analysis so that the immunological consequence of each
mutation on the surface of the HA molecule could be analyzed.
Similar structural analysis of the NA molecule revealed that some
of the amino acid changes we observed in the NA molecule were
located near the catalytic site of the neuraminidase (Figure 5). Of
the mutations found on the surface of the NA molecule, at least 3
amino acid changes were located in antigenic sites [8] (Figure 5).
At present, the antigenicity of NA is less well characterized as
compared to HA molecule and the contribution of neuraminidase-
specific antibodies in virus neutralization is still a topic of further
studies.
The relatively high number of virus strains characterized in our
study enabled us to estimate the evolutionary rates of HA and NA
genes. During the 9 month observation period, when pandemic
viruses were identified in Finland, the evolution rate at the amino
acid level was estimated to be approximately 1.5% for the HA1
molecule and 1.1% for the NA molecule, respectively (Figure 6).
This observed evolutionary speed is somewhat higher than what
has previously been calculated for seasonal H3N2 viruses [14].
However, during the first year of circulation, mutations in the
surface glycoproteins of the pandemic virus may accumulate at
random until a most fit variant has established itself and further
evolution takes a more linear rate. None of the mutations thus far
detected in Finnish pandemic viruses gave rise to a dominant
strain with high epidemic potential or replication advantage, and
the evolutionary rate in the viruses was relatively low. The future
years will show whether the evolutionary speed of the 2009
pandemic virus will increase from that seen during the first
pandemic year. An additional interesting finding was that a novel
glycosylation site was introduced in the NA molecule of one of our
viruses. Similar changes could also occur in the HA which could,
in turn, lead to alterations in the antigenicity and immunogenicity
of the virus.
Vaccines and antiviral drugs play an important role in the
prevention and treatment of influenza virus infections. In order to
select suitable vaccine strains and to detect possible emergence of
drug-resistant viruses the characterization of circulating viruses
must be continuously performed. Considering the number of
amino acid changes and their sites within the structures of the HA
and NA molecules of the 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus,
it is likely that vaccination with the A/California/07/2009 or
infection with the pandemic virus will provide protective immunity
at least for some time to come. However, forthcoming antigenic
analyses of the pandemic viruses and clinical vaccination studies
by us and others will provide more information on the evolution of
the pandemic virus and the protective efficacy of the present
pandemic virus vaccine.
Materials and Methods
Clinical samples and epidemic data
The first infections of the 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1)
were identified in Finland on May 10, 2009. During the period
from May 4, 2009 and June 20, 2010, (weeks 19/09­24/10) a total
of 7,669 laboratory confirmed infections of the 2009 pandemic
influenza A(H1N1) viruses were reported to the National
Infectious Disease Registry coordinated by the National Institute
for Health and Welfare (THL). Clinical samples from suspected
cases as well as some laboratory confirmed infections were sent to
the National Influenza Centre at THL Helsinki for confirmation
and detailed analysis. The clinical samples have been collected for
Figure 6. Evolutionary rates of the HA1 and NA genes. The number of nucleotide and amino acid changes between the HA1 (panel A) and NA
(panel B) of Finnish pandemic viruses and the vaccine strain A/California/07/2009 are shown as a function of time. The trend lines in both pictures
have been drawn using Microsoft Office Excel 2003. The numbers of nucleotide changes are shown in blue and in amino acid changes in green.

routine virological laboratory diagnosis, requested by physician
examining and treating the patients. Based on national laws ethical
permissions are not required for specific microbiological diagnos-
tics, treatment of the patients and further characterization of the
viruses. All samples were coded and tested anonymously and
further antigenic and genetic characterization of circulating
influenza viruses was carried out at Viral Infections Unit at
THL, which also functions as a National Influenza Centre. Patient
information is stored according to national regulations and access
to such data is restricted.
The detection of the 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus was
carried out by standard real-time RT-PCR procedures with specific
primers for HA and NS genes. Primer sequences for real-time RT-
PCR are available on request. For the present study 141 positive virus
samples collected from 138 patients were chosen. They represented
both mild (n = 115) and severe (n=23) infections (pneumonia with or
without acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and patients
requiring intensive care that lead to recovery or to fatal outcome).
Also geographic origin and temporal distribution of samples were
considered in the selection of the samples that were included in the
analysis. From 48 of the 138 patients previous travel history was also
known. To study the genetic variation of the 2009 pandemic
influenza A(H1N1) viruses since its emergence and during the first
wave in Finland, the nucleotide sequences of the complete HA gene
(1701 nucleotides, 567 amino acids) from 127 viruses and the HA1
region (1032 nucleotides, 344 amino acids) from additional 10 viruses
were generated. The NA gene sequences (1401 nucleotides, 467
amino acids) from 137 viruses were also obtained. The sample
collection date of the strains selected to the phylogenetic and
molecular analysis covered the period from May 10, 2009 to
February 2, 2010. The GenBank accession numbers of the HA
sequences are GQ183633, GQ283488, GQ283493, GU292341,
HQ228025­HQ228147 and HQ234707­HQ234716 and those
of NA sequences are GQ183634, GQ283487, GQ283492 and
HQ247604­HQ247737. The GenBank hemagglutinin and neur-
aminidase gene accession numbers for A/California/07/2009
vaccine virus were FJ966974 and FJ984386, respectively.
Gene sequence analysis and phylogenetic analysis
RNA was isolated from a 100 ml aliquot of combined nasal and
throat specimens using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden,
Germany) with QIAcube automated purification instrument
according to the manufacturer's instructions. In three occasions,
total cellular RNA was isolated from viruses cultured in MDCK
cells or embryonated hen's eggs. The viral RNA was reverse
transcribed into cDNA with SuperScriptTM
III reverse transcrip-
tase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. The resulting DNA was amplified using nested PCR.
The amplified products were purified with QIAquick PCR
Purification Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany). Sequencing
of both DNA strands was carried out using an ABI Prism Big Dye
Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit with an ABI
3730 automated DNA sequencer (Perkin Elmer Applied BioSys-
tems, Foster City, CA). Primer sequences for HA and NA
amplification and for sequencing are available on request.
Sequence data was analyzed and fragments were assembled using
Sequencher version 4.7 (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor,
USA). Mega software version 4 [15] (Molecular Evolutionary
Genetics Analysis) was used in sequence comparisons of HA and
NA and for the construction of the phylogenetic trees. The
phylogenetic trees were generated using the Neighbor-joining
method [16] with the maximum composite likelihood model [17].
Bootstrapping was performed with 1000 duplicates [18]. All HA
residues are numbered omitting the signal peptide sequence. In the
numbering of NA residues, the signal peptide sequence was
included.
Structural analysis of HA and NA molecules
The three-dimensional structures of the HA and NA were used
to locate the amino acid differences between the Finnish 2009
pandemic viruses and the A/California/07/2009 vaccine strain.
Because the HA and NA of the 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1)
virus resembles more those of the Spanish influenza virus [1] than
of recent seasonal human H1N1 viruses, the three-dimensional
structures of HA of A/South Carolina/1/18 (RCSB Protein Bank
accession number 1ruz) and NA of A/Brevig Mission/1/1918
(RCSB Protein Bank accession number 3beq) were selected for the
structural comparisons. The molecular models presented here
were constructed using RasMol Molecular Graphics software
version 2.7.3 [19].
Statistical analysis of disease association with certain
amino acid changes on the hemagglutinin molecule
Certain amino acid changes in the hemagglutinin molecule
observed in the present study and by others [3,4,5,6] have been
found in severe cases (Table 1). Statistical power of such an
association has been calculated by Fisher's exact test (http://www.
graphpad.com/quickcalcs/contingency1.cfm).
