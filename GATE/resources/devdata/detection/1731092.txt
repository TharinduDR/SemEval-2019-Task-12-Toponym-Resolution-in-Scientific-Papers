The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of 40 influenza virus hemagglutinin genes of the H3 serotype from
mammalian and avian species and 9 genes of the H4 serotype were compared, and their evolutionary
relationships were evaluated. From these relationships, the differences in the mutational characteristics of the
viral hemagglutinin in different hosts were examined and the RNA sequence changes that occurred during the
generation of the progenitor of the 1968 human pandemic strain were examined. Three major lineages were
defined: one containing only equine virus isolates; one containing only avian virus isolates; and one containing
avian, swine, and human virus isolates. The human pandemic strain of 1968 was derived from an avian virus
most similar to those isolated from ducks in Asia, and the transfer of this virus to humans probably occurred
in 1965. Since then, the human viruses have diverged from this progenitor, with the accumulation of
approximately 7.9 nucleotide and 3.4 amino acid substitutions per year. Reconstruction of the sequence of the
hypothetical ancestral strain at the avian-human transition indicated that only 6 amino acids in the mature
hemagglutinin molecule were changed during the transition between an avian virus strain and a human
pandemic strain. All of these changes are located in regions of the molecule known to affect receptor binding
and antigenicity. Unlike the human H3 influenza virus strains, the equine virus isolates have no close relatives
in other species and appear to have diverged from the avian viruses much earlier than did the human virus
strains. Mutations were estimated to have accumulated in the equine virus lineage at approximately 3.1
nucleotides and 0.8 amino acids per year. Four swine virus isolates in the analysis each appeared to have been
introduced into pigs independently, with two derived from human viruses and two from avian viruses. A
comparison of the coding and noncoding mutations in the mammalian and avian lineages showed a significantly
lower ratio of coding to total nucleotide changes in the avian viruses. Additionally, the avian virus lineages of
both the H3 and H4 serotypes, but not the mammalian virus lineages, showed significantly greater conservation
of amino acid sequence in the internal branches of the phylogenetic tree than in the terminal branches. The
small number of amino acid differences between the avian viruses and the progenitor of the 1968 pandemic
strain and the great phenotypic stability of the avian viruses suggest that strains similar to the progenitor strain
will continue to circulate in birds and will be available for reintroduction into humans.
Influenza viruses of the H3 serotype appeared in humans
and caused a major pandemic in 1968. Subsequently, it was
found that antigenically related viruses had been present in
ducks and horses for a minimum of 5 years earlier (27). It is
now known that H3 serotype viruses are widely distributed
in waterfowl and have also been associated with occasional
outbreaks of swine influenza. Serologic archaeology studies
have suggested that antigenically related viruses circulated
in humans during the 1890s, leading to the hypothesis that
this and other serotypes may periodically recycle through
the human population (28).
Previous studies with isolates of the human H3 viruses (5,
6, 14, 43) showed the progressive accumulation of mutations
in the prevalent circulating strains and correlated these
mutations with the progressive antigenic changes seen in the
human strains. Antigenic characterization of H3N2 swine
influenza viruses isolates (40, 41) suggested that these vi-
ruses had been derived from early human H3N2 viruses and
had maintained antigenic characteristics that had been lost in
later human virus isolates. Kida et al. (24, 25) analyzed a
series of Asian avian and swine viruses and found some of
the avian H3 hemagglutinin closely related to both the swine
and human H3N2 viruses. The interrelationships of the H3

equine influenza viruses have been studied by Daniels et al.
(10) and Kawaoka et al. (22).
We initiated this study to define the detailed evolutionary
relationships among the H3 influenza viruses, to determine
the mutational characteristics of the virus in different hosts,
and to investigate the characteristics of the virus strain
proposed to be the progenitor of the human pandemic strain.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Virus strains and nucleic acid sequencing. The nucleic acid
sequences of 40 HA genes from influenza viruses of the H3
serotype and 9 of the H4 serotype were analyzed in this
study. The sources of the virus isolate sequences are sum-
marized in Table 1. Those not previously published were
obtained from the repository ofSt. Jude Children's Research
Hospital. Virus was grown and purified, and virion RNA was
prepared as described previously (3). Sequencing was either
directly from virion RNA as described previously (4) or from
full-length clones in the pATX vector as described by
Kawaoka et al. (22). Of the sequences taken from the
literature, 17 reported only the nucleotides coding for the
mature peptide. For these strains (Table 1), the sequence
coding for the signal peptide was obtained from virion RNA.
An aligned compilation of the 40 H3 sequences will be
provided on request.

a The published sequence reported only the sequence coding for the mature polypeptide. The sequence of the signal peptide region was determined from viral
RNA as described in Materials and Methods.
Phylogenetic analysis. Phylogenetic analysis was primarily
performed by using the program PAUP (Phylogenetic Anal-
ysis Using Parsimony), version 2.4 (David L. Swofford,
Illinois Natural History Survey, Champaign, Ill.). Searches
for the most parsimonious topologies for the nucleotide and
amino acid sequences of the entire data set (49 taxa) were
done using the MULPARS and global swap options. De-
tailed studies of specified regions of the tree to determine
optimal and alternative topologies were done by using the
branch and bound algorithm with the BBSAVE options.
Phylogenetic analyses of the nucleic acid sequence in which
coding substitutions were weighted more heavily than non-
coding changes was done by appending each amino acid
sequence to its nucleotide sequence and submitting the
combined sequence to maximum parsimony analysis. This
effectively doubled the weight of each coding substitution.
Greater weights for the coding changes were obtained by
applying the WEIGHTS option of PAUP to the characters
representing the appended amino acids. Hypothetical ances-
tral sequences were generated as described by Fitch (13).
Statistical analysis. The amino acid change to nucleotide
change ratio was estimated for the internal and terminal

EVOLUTION OF THE INFLUENZA VIRUS H3 HEMAGGLUTININ 1131
branches of the phylogenetic tree for the different host
species by regressing amino acid changes on nucleotide
changes. Because the variance of amino acid changes for a
given branch is proportional to nucleotide changes (binomial
theory), the data were weighted by 1/nucleotide change,
which is a standard method for assigning weights. Differ-
ences in the mutation rates of the HAl and HA2 domains for
different lineages were assessed by using the chi-square test.
Nucleotide sequence accession numbers. The nucleotide
sequences for the strains not previously published are avail-
able from GenBank under accession numbers M73771
through M73776.
RESULTS
The deduced amino acid sequences for the entire coding
regions of the hemagglutinins of the 40 H3 influenza virus
strains and that of a hypothetical avian virus ancestor are
shown in Fig. 1. The 13 equine virus isolates are 1 amino acid
shorter than those from other species, and the alignment
used by Daniels et al. (10) is shown. Of the 566 amino acids,
351 are invariant, and 68 others are invariant in all except
one of the isolates. The most conserved of the amino acids is
tryptophan. Of the 12 tryptophans in the sequence of the
ancestral avian virus, 10 are invariant, followed by tyrosine
(16 of 20), methionine (7 of 9), histidine (8 of 11), and
cysteine (13 of 18). These five conserved amino acids are
also among the least abundant. The least conserved amino
acid is valine. Of 33 valines in the ancestral sequence, 14 are
invariant.
For the estimation of evolutionary relationships among the
virus isolates, only the nucleotide sequence of the coding
region (nucleotides 30 to 1730) was used in this analysis,
because the sequences of the noncoding 3' and 5' ends,
although highly conserved where they are known, are not
available for many of the strains studied. Insertions and
deletions of codons were recorded for this analysis to
assume that each occurred as a single mutational event
rather than as three mutations. The H4 hemagglutinin was
previously shown by Air (1) to be more closely related to the
H3 hemagglutinins than that of any of the other subtypes.
Therefore, nine H4 influenza virus gene sequences were
included in these analyses as an outgroup to provide a
hypothetical origin for the H3 lineage and to provide further
information on the genetic conservation of the avian viruses.
Their alignment with the H3 sequences is that used by Donis
et al. (11).
The shortest path connecting the 49 nucleotide sequences
required 2,817 steps. This pathway split the H3 taxa into
three major lineages: one containing only avian viruses; one
containing avian, human, and swine virus isolates; and one
containing all of the equine virus isolates. Several ap-
proaches were used to test the robustness of the topology.
Since the number of taxa was too great to allow an exhaus-
tive search of all possible topologies, alternative topologies
and shorter paths were searched for by' reanalyzing the data
after dividing the tree into major sections. The data set was
also analyzed by using the amino acid sequences. This
resulted in a tree with the same general topology as the tree
based on the nucleic acid sequences, but the presence of
several short and zero-length internal branches connecting
the avian virus isolates resulted in a large number (>50) of
equally parsimonious solutions. This problem was elimi-
nated by including the entire RNA sequence and applying
greater weight to the coding changes. This allowed the
junctions affected by amino acid changes to be studied while
preserving those supported only by silent mutations. The
coding changes supported a phylogenetic tree differing from
that supported by all nucleotide changes at two ofthe branch
points. These are labeled A and B in Fig. 2 and are detailed
in Fig. 3. One of these (node B) significantly affects the
interpreted origin of the equine lineage and is discussed
below. The other has a minor effect on the Asian avian
lineage near the origin of the human virus but does not affect
the interpretation of the avian-human virus junction. The
only other significant ambiguity was at the joining of the two
1968 human virus strains (Aichi and NT/60) with the rest of
the tree. In the topology shown, a 3-nucleotide, 0-amino-acid
branch joins these two strains with the trunk of the tree. An
equally parsimonious solution branches each separately
from the same point on the trunk. Analysis of the H3
nucleotide data using the Neighbor Joining Method (36) gave
a topology nearly identical to that obtained when all nucle-
otides were used with the maximum parsimony method. The
only difference was that Swine/Ukkel/84 branched from the
main trunk immediately before the branch containing Vic/75
and Swine/Col/77, rather than immediately after this branch.
The significance of this difference is not known.
The remarkable features of the phylogenetic tree are the
close linkage of the human virus lineage to the avian viruses,
the rapid divergence of the human viruses from their origin,
the great separation of the equine viruses from those of other
species, and the strong conservation of the amino acid
sequence in the avian lineages.
Analysis of the avian-human junction. The phylogenetic
tree indicates that the human virus of the H3N2 serotype
originated from a lineage closely related to a series of avian
virus isolates from Asia described by Kida et al. (24). To
identify the changes that occurred in this virus during its
transition from an avian pathogen to a human pandemic
strain, the hypothetical ancestral sequences of the last avian
and first human strains (Fig. 2, nodes A and C) were
determined (13) and their differences were studied in detail.
The transition required 13 nucleic acid changes, 7 of which
affect the amino acid sequence. The locations of these
changes are shown in Fig. 1. One change is not part of the
mature protein but is at a highly variable site in the signal
peptide; the others are all in the HAl peptide and in the head
of the molecule. These locations are detailed in Fig. 4, and
their significance is discussed below.
Rates of accumulation of mutations. The mutation rate of
the human sublineage was estimated by plotting the year of
isolation against the evolutionary path distances from node
A to each isolate (Fig. 5, top). Regression analysis gave
mutation rates of 7.9 nucleotides and 3.4 amino acids per
year for the coding region (1,701 nucleotides, 566 amino
acids). Two swine influenza virus isolates derived from the
human virus lineage (Swine/Col/1/77 and Swine/Ukkel/84)
were included in these calculations, but the calculated
mutation rate is not significantly affected when they are
excluded. Extrapolation of the nucleotide regression lines
gives dates of 1967 and 1965 for nodes C and A, respectively.
Similar analysis of the equine virus lineage (Fig. 5, bot-
tom) gives substitution rates of 3.1 nucleotides and 0.8 amino
acids per year. The date of origin for the lineage (node D,
Fig. 2), extrapolated from the nucleotide regression, is 1952.
The approximately linear relationship between the number
of mutations and the isolation date is valid for the topology
shown in Fig. 2 but not for the alternative topology (Fig. 3,
top right). With the alternative topology, the 1971 and 1972
isolates are farther from the origin (node B) than are the 1986
strains, and the four earliest isolates appear to form a

and amino acid branch lengths for each branch type and
range from 0.46 for the internal human virus isolates to 0.074
for the internal branches of the H4 virus strains. The ratios
of coding to total changes of the human internal branches are
greater than those for the human terminal branches. The
opposite is the case for the equine viruses; none of the
differences among the mammalian virus branches is statisti-
cally significant. However, the ratios for the internal
branches of the avian virus lineages are significantly lower
than those for the terminal branches, and the differences
between the avian and mammalian branches are also signif-
icant.
To allow examination of the distribution of coding and
noncoding mutations on the H3 hemagglutinin polypeptide,
the hypothetical ancestral sequences of the H3 strains were
reconstructed as described by Fitch (13) and each variable
position in the RNA sequence was examined. Figure 6
shows each mutation plotted according to its position in the
protein sequence, its host lineage, and whether it is coding or
noncoding.
The paucity of coding changes in the avian virus lineage
and their concentration between amino acids 50 and 300 in
the human strains are readily apparent. The partition of the
coding and noncoding changes between HAl and HA2 in the
various species and branch types of the H3 strains was
analyzed in detail (Table 3). The coding changes for each of
the mammalian lineages show a significant deviation from a
random distribution, whereas the mutations in the avian
virus lineages do not. No coding regions were found notably
lacking in silent mutations.

DISCUSSION
FIG. 3. Alternative topologies for two ambiguous junctions of
the phylogenetic tree. Differences between the most parsimonious
trees calculated from the nucleotide sequences and slightly longer
trees requiring fewer amino acid changes are shown. (Top) Equine-
avian junction (Fig. 2, node B). The shortest tree is shown on the
right. With this topology, the four earliest equine viruses share a
common divergence from the main lineage and require 2,817 nucle-
otide changes for the 49 taxa. With the topology on the left,
Eq/Tokyo/71 and Eq/Algeria/72 branch from the main lineage before
the two 1963 isolates. This topology requires two fewer amino acid
changes but five additional nucleotide changes. The topology on the
left is used in Fig. 1 and was chosen because it provides a consistent
relationship between the date of virus isolation and distance from
the origin ofthe equine virus lineage. (Bottom) Four avian taxa near
the avian-human junction (Fig. 2, node A). The joining on the right
requires three additional nucleotide substitutions but one less amino
acid substitution. The topology on the left was used in Fig. 1.
This study was initiated to define the source and charac-
teristics of the progenitor of the hemagglutinin of the current
H3 human viruses and to provide a better understanding of
the genetic interrelationships and mutational constraints of
the virus strains in different hosts. The H3 hemagglutinin
phylogeny calculated from the sequence data clearly shows
that there is a remarkably close relationship among the first
human H3 viruses and some of the virus strains still circu-
lating in avian species. The results indicate that the human
hemagglutinin gene was very recently introduced into the
virus infecting humans and that it underwent only a few
mutations in its transition from an avian virus to a human
pandemic strain. One of these mutations (position 226) has
been previously implicated in host specificity (30). Of the
others, three (positions 62, 144, and 193) are among the most
variable in the molecule, each having three or four different
amino acids at the site within the human lineage. These
locations have been shown to be affected by antigenic drift
or host range selection (5, 6, 20, 21, 44). One of the sites
(position 193), which changes from Asn to Ser during the
transition, later reverts to the ancestral form. The changes at
these positions may not have been part of the adaptation of
the avian virus to humans but may have been the early stages
of antigenic drift that occurred before the virus had been
detected.
The calculated date of 1965 for the introduction of the H3
gene into a human virus is made on the basis of assumptions
that the mutation rate ofthe virus has been constant, that the

introduction occurred at node A on the phylogenetic tree,
and that there were no intermediate hosts. The assumption
that the introduction occurred at node A rather than at node
C (Fig. 2) is based on the high ratio of coding to noncoding
changes in the branch linking nodes A and C which is
characteristic of the virus in humans rather than in birds.
The evolutionary record provides no evidence for an
intermediate host between the avian and human sublineages,
but it cannot be ruled out that one may have existed, and the
possibility of swine intermediaries in the generation of
human influenza virus strains has been previously consid-
ered (15, 19, 26, 31, 32, 37-39, 45). Of the four swine virus
isolates included in this analysis, two were introduced into
swine from the human virus lineage and two are recent
introductions from avian viruses. This finding and previous
evidence for the transmission of virus between birds and
swine (19, 34), as well as documented transmissions of
influenza virus from swine to humans (18, 35), leaves open
the possibility that a swine intermediate could have been
involved. The ratios of the coding changes to mutations in
the four swine virus isolates included in this study were
similar to those of the human strains. Thus, the data are
consistent with a transfer of the hemagglutinin from the
avian reservoir into swine at node C and then into humans at
node A. Regardless of the initial mammalian host, if the
amino acid substitutions during this period were selected by
antibody pressure, the virus is likely to have been the

detection.
In contrast to the progressive changes of both the nucle-
otide and amino acid sequences of the mammalian virus
lineages, the avian viruses show far less variation and no
clear relationship between the position on the phylogenetic
tree and the date of isolation. Additionally, most of the
coding changes in the avian lineages have occurred in the
terminal branches, whereas in the mammalian lineages the
terminal and internal branches have similar ratios of coding
and noncoding changes. This fundamental difference in the

evolution of the avian viruses suggests that their long-term
survival favors those that have maintained the original
phenotype. If survival favors those that have not changed,
then virus populations in environments that undergo rela-
tively few replication cycles would be more likely to yield
progeny that do not have deleterious mutations. Those
replicating in other environments or mutants in the original
population might have a temporary selective advantage in a
particular host or environment, but the accumulation of
mutations in these subpopulations would be deleterious in
other circumstances. Thus, the original population (perhaps
often in a very small minority) would have a selective
advantage as hosts or environmental conditions change.
The striking difference in the topologies of the H3 and H4
avian lineages in comparison with the human virus lineage is
apparently due to a heavy positive selective pressure on
viruses replicating in humans that is not seen when replicat-
ing in birds. Fitch et al. (14) have studied the unusual
"cactuslike" topology of the human influenza A viruses and
have shown that the proportion of amino acid changes
affecting antigenic regions of the hemagglutinin (HA1) is
greater on the main trunk than on the side branches of the
tree. This provided convincing evidence for positive Darwin-
ian selection on the HAl molecule, mediated by immune
pressure. They calculated the age of the nonsurviving side
branches (the distance from the main lineage trunk to the
branch tips) to be 1.6 years. The present study, using a very
different data set and the entire coding sequence, gives a
very similar value of 1.5 years. The increased mutation rate
seen in the hemagglutinin when transferred from an avian to
a mammalian host is paralleled by smaller increases in the
mutation rates of other genes (9, 14, 16).
The topology of the avian virus lineages resembles that
described for the human influenza C virus (7, 8, 47), with
multiple cocirculating lineages and little correlation between
tree position and date of isolation. In both cases this may
reflect a long-established equilibrium between the virus and
the host. The influenza B viruses show a regular relationship
between tree position and isolation date but a slower rate of

change than the human influenza A strains and cocirculating
branches that survive much longer than the short side
branches of the influenza A viruses (14, 47). Air et al. (2)
have analyzed the proportion of silent and nonsilent muta-
tions in the human A and B viruses and have proposed that
the evolution of the B viruses is not primarily driven by
immune selection.
In the present study, the only internal avian branches with
a large proportion of coding changes on the phylogenetic tree
are the long links connecting the H3 equine viruses and the
H4's with the rest of the taxa. However, these lengths and
their connection points to each other must be interpreted
with caution. The large number of silent mutations, particu-
larly in the link to the H4 viruses, make it likely that the total
number of mutations is underestimated, since any of them
could have mutated multiple times. Lacking evolutionary
intermediates and with no information on what selective
pressures or time periods were involved in the separation of
the HA subtypes, we cannot estimate the actual lengths of
these branches with any certainty.
The stability of the avian strains suggests that the virus has
reached an adaptive optimum in birds that has not been
achieved in humans. There are several possible explanations
for this difference. One obvious possibility is that because
this gene was only recently introduced into the human virus,
it has not had time to reach an optimal configuration.
Another possibility is that when the virus is in humans there
is sufficient flexibility in the interaction of the hemagglutinin
with the host that no single configuration is optimal and that
mutations selected by antibody may not significantly affect
other properties or functions of the protein. This implies that
in an immunologically naive population, the viruses derived
by continued immunological selection would not be at a
selective disadvantage if placed in competition with the
original strain. A third possibility, and perhaps the most
likely, is that the H3 hemagglutinin was already in its optimal
configuration after its initial adaptation as a human patho-
gen. Subsequent mutations in response to antibody pres-
sures in the human population, while essential for the
continued survival of the virus lineage, would put the virus
at a disadvantage ifforced to compete with the original strain
in an immunologically naive population. This question re-
mains to be tested directly but is consistent with the ob-
served periodic replacement of influenza virus strains in the
human population with another serotype and the hypothe-
sized recycling ofinfluenza virus strains (28). If the recycling
of influenza virus serotypes is to occur, it requires a mech-
anism for maintaining the virus while it is not circulating in
humans, and the avian virus reservoir clearly provides one.
The highly conserved phenotype of the H3 hemagglutinin in
birds suggests that strains very similar to the progenitor of
the 1968 pandemic will continue to circulate in birds and will
be available for reintroduction into mammalian hosts in the
future.
