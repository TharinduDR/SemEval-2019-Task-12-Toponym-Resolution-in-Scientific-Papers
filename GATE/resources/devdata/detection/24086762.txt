Abstract
The swine-origin H1N1 virus which emerged in 2009 resulted in the first influenza pandemic of the 21st
century.
Although the majority of infections were moderate, a significant proportion of infections were severe and
characterized by acute respiratory distress syndrome and pulmonary edema. We compared two isolates from the
2009 H1N1 pandemic; A/California/07/09 (CA/07) and A/Netherlands/602/09 (NL/602) viruses that share greater than
99% sequence identity. Though genetically similar, these viruses exhibit contrasting pathological effects. Mice that
were infected with 800 plaque forming unit (PFU) of CA/07 virus rapidly lost weight, which was concurrent with
detection of high pulmonary concentrations of MCP-1, MIG, IP-10 and TIMP-1. Initially, severe bronchiolar epithelial
necrosis and acute respiratory distress was observed, followed by marked bronchiolar epithelial hyperplasia.
Mononuclear cell infiltration was initially localized to perivascular and peribronchiolar interstitium and then spread to
adjacent alveoli. Infiltrating cells were phenotypically CD11bhi
, F4/80lo
. In contrast, when mice were infected with 800
PFU of NL/602 virus, minimal weight loss was observed, and concentrations of cytokines in the lung were
significantly lower. Inflammation was primarily restricted to the bronchioles and perivascular interstitium with minimal
spread to alveoli. Infiltrating cells include foamy macrophages and surface markers were characterized as CD11blo/-
,
F4/80hi
. These two genetically similar viruses can be useful strains with which to investigate immune-regulatory
determinants of pathogenesis of influenza virus.

Introduction
Influenza A virus is an orthomyxovirus with eight negative
sense RNA segments. Emergence of influenza pandemics in
the human population occurs when gene segments of at least
two viruses reassort, creating a novel virus that expresses a
hemagglutinin (HA) and or neuraminidase (NA) gene that were
previously undetected in humans. Three influenza A virus
pandemics occurred in the 20th
century, each caused by a virus
with an antigenically distinct HA protein. The first and most
notable, known as the Spanish influenza occurred in
1918-1919 (H1N1), remains unprecedented for its high
mortality and attack rate [1]. The Asian virus emerged in 1957
(H2N2), followed by the Hong Kong virus (H3N2) in 1967 [2]. In
2009, a novel H1N1 swine-origin virus (pH1N1) was first
detected in Mexico and rapidly spread across the globe,
heralding the first influenza pandemic of the 21st
century.
In the US, influenza related illness is estimated to contribute
to 3,000-49,000 deaths annually (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/
disease/us_flu-related_deaths.htm), posing substantial
economic and health related burdens. Seasonal influenza
poses greatest risk to the elderly, young children and people
with health related complications, whereas infection in healthy
younger adults is typically cleared within one to two weeks. In
contrast, pandemic influenza viruses can pose an increased
relative burden of severe disease in healthy young adults
lacking preexisting immunity. Histological examination of lung
specimen from patients infected with 1918 or H5N1 viruses
revealed alveolar leakage, respiratory epithelial cell
destruction, edema, hyperplasia and development of acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [3-7]. Although the
majority of cases were mild to moderate in nature, pH1N1
caused sporadic cases of ARDS and death in some patients
[8,9]. Similar to the 1918 pandemic, severe pH1N1 infection
was found in patients 5-59 years of age [10,11]. The CDC data
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 September 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 9 | e76708
indicated that unlike seasonal influenza, cases and death
associated with pH1N1 weighed more heavily on young,
healthy adults ages 18-64 (http://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/
estimates_2009_h1n1.htm) during the 2009-2010 influenza
season.
Several viral gene products that play a central role in
determinacy of virulence have been described. These virulence
factors include the HA, NA, NS and PB1 gene products.
Reassortant virus that expresses the HA and NA genes of
1918 virus induces severe pathology and cytokine
dysregulation in nonhuman primates [3] and mice [12,13].
Moreover, the virus nonstructural protein 1 (NS 1) can interact
with cellular machinery and disrupt type 1 interferon (IFN-1)
pathways [14]. Expression of the alternate reading frame of the
polymerase basic protein 1 gene (PB1-F2) can induce
apoptosis of monocytes [15]. These strategies to evade
immune detection may contribute to enhancement of viral
replication. Unchecked prolific viral replication in lungs [4,13]
and dissemination to non-respiratory tract tissues may result in
increased mortality and severe pathogenesis [16]. It is thought
that that virulence is polygenic and primarily associated with
HA, NS1, PB1 and PB2 genes [17]. Mutations that correlate
with virulence such as PB1-317 and PB2-355 are strongly
associated with mutations in NS1 at positions 92 and 228.
Together these dramatically affect virulence. These studies
demonstrate that there are many viral mechanisms that
contribute to virulence; however, diversity of the viruses poses
challenges to identifying immune-modulators of pathology.
A hallmark feature of pathogenic influenza infection and a
correlate of disease severity is the exuberant production of
cytokines that are detected in the lung and systemically [18],
also referred as cytokine dysregulation or cytokine storm.
Compared to seasonal influenza virus, elevated concentration
of cytokines are detected in the lungs of cynomologus
macaques infected with H5N1 viruses or reassortants that
express the HA and NA of the 1918 virus [3]. This corresponds
to rapid and excessive pulmonary infiltration of macrophages
and neutrophils [13]. Human patients infected with highly
pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus exhibit elevated
cytokines and viral titers in lungs and nasal swabs compared to
seasonal H3 or H1 infected patients [4]. Airway epithelial cells
are primary targets of influenza virus and these cells
upregulate production of cytokines upon infection with H5N1
virus [19]. Alveolar macrophages can also be infected by
influenza virus and contribute to the cytokine cascade,
although reproductive infection and induction of cytokines can
vary greatly [19,20]. Severe pathology associated with the
1918 pandemic influenza infection disproportionately affects
healthy adults and the complications can arise early after
infection. This suggests that an excessive immune response
may be detrimental to the host [21].
During 2009, more hospitalizations were associated with
infection with the pH1N1 than with previous seasonal influenza
virus. Analysis of sequences derived from clinical isolates
revealed limited genetic heterogeneity, supporting the view that
the virus emerged in humans as a single event [22]. The limited
genetic diversity of pH1N1 suggests that these viruses may
share more similar biochemical features than viruses with
entirely distinct genomes. The range in pathogenicity
associated with viral infection and limited genetic diversity of
the 2009 H1N1 virus provide an opportunity to better evaluate
the immune-dependent modulators of pathogenesis. Lethal
infection of influenza virus correlates with lower respiratory
tract infection. Avian influenza virus binds to 2-3 sialic acids,
which can be found in the lower respiratory tract of humans
[23,24]. High viral titer is correlated with severe or lethal
infection; however, associated tissues are collected post-
mortem, when virus extraction is less reliable and difficult to
ascertain. To investigate if differences in viral tropism and viral
replication contribute to the range of pathology observed during
influenza virus infection, mice were infected with one of two
related type A influenza viruses from the 2009 pandemic H1N1.
A/California/07/09 (CA/07) was isolated during the summer of
2009 from a 54 year old man residing in southern California
and A/Netherlands/602/09 (NL/602) was the first laboratory-
confirmed case of the pandemic virus in the Netherlands
isolated from a three year old male [25]. We demonstrate that
maximum viral titer was detected two to four days post-
infection with more effective resolution of NL/602 virus.
Infection with CA/07 was accompanied by elevated cytokine
production and massive inflammation in the respiratory tract
that also resulted in acute respiratory distress. In contrast
infection with NL/602 was mild to moderate in severity. This
study describes a useful model to evaluate the immune
regulation of pathogenesis associated with influenza virus
infections.
Materials and Methods
Ethics Statement
This study was carried out in strict accordance with the
recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. Mice
were sterile housed and treated according to Emory University
(Atlanta, GA) guidelines and all animal studies were approved
by the Emory University Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee (Emory animal welfare assurance number
A3180-01).
Virus
CA/07 and NL/602 viruses were propagated in Madin-Darby
Canine Kidney (MDCK, American Type Culture Collection,
Manassas, VA) cells. Viruses were seeded at a multiplicity of
infection (MOI) of 0.01 in MEM. Culture supernatant was
collected after two days, cell debris was clarified by
centrifugation and culture supernatant containing virus was
stored at -80°C until further use. Virus titer was determined by
plaque titration as previously described [26]. 50% mouse lethal
dose (mLD50) was calculated for CA/07 virus (103.75
PFU) using
the method described by Reed and Muench [27]. Mortality was
not observed in mice infected with NL/602 virus.
Animals
Female Balb/c and DBA/2 mice ages 6-8 weeks, were
purchased from Harlan Laboratories (Indianapolis, IN). Mice

were lightly anesthetized under isoflurane gas and
administered 800 PFU of virus in 20 µl volume inoculum
intranasally (i.n.). Animals were monitored daily and humanely
sacrificed at the experimental endpoint which is defined as
weight loss exceeding 25% of the original body weight. For
Bronchoalveolar lavage, mice were sacrificed by intraperitoneal
injection with Ketamine (93 mg/kg body weight) and Dormitor
(1.25 mg/kg body weight) and BAL fluid was collected by
flushing 0.8 ml of PBS containing Complete EDTA-Free
Protease inhibitor (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) into the lungs of
naïve or virus-infected mice.
Real-Time PCR
Lungs were aseptically removed, weighed, placed in PBS at
a final concentration of 200 mg/ml and homogenized using a
Dounce homogenizer. One half of the homogenized lung
suspension was stored in -80°C and virus titer was determined
by plaque titration on MDCK cells. The remaining half of the
lung suspension was further homogenized in a FastPrep 24
bead beater using Lysing matrix D (MP Biomedicals, Santa
Ana, CA) and stored in RNAlater (Life Technologies) until RNA
purification. Total RNA was extracted using RNAqueous kit
(Life Technologies) following the protocol provided by the
manufacturer. cDNA was synthesized using random hexamer
primers and Multiscribe reverse transcriptase (Life
Technologies). Viral transcripts were detected by real-time
quantitative PCR using M gene specific primers; 5'-
ggactgcagcgtagacgctt-3' (forward), 5'-
catcctgttgtatatgaggcccat-3' (reverse) and 5' FAM-
ctaagctattcaactggtgcacttgcca-3' BHQ (probe, Integrated DNA
Technologies, Coralville, IA). Viral RNA was normalized to
GAPDH. A standard was prepared for CA/07 and NL/602 by
sucrose density gradient purification as described previously
[26]. Plaque titer was determined and translated to Relative
Transcript Units (RTU)
Histology
Tissues were prepared for immunohistochemistry and
immunofluorescence staining as previously described [28]. In
brief, blood was flushed from the lung by cutting the left atrium
and saline was injected into the right ventricle. The lung was
inflated by injecting 0.8 ml of 50% OCT compound into the
trachea. The trachea was ligated and lung was excised and
frozen in OCT compound chilled over liquid nitrogen. Eight µm
thick tissue sections were cut using a microtome (Leica
Biosystem, Buffalo Grove, IL). Tissues were air dried and
dehydrated in acetone. Non-specific binding was blocked by
incubating tissues with biotin blocking kit (Vector Labs,
Burlingame, CA) and 10% goat serum. Tissues were incubated
with rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific to influenza virus
nucleoprotein (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO) anti-CD11b-PE
(Becton Dickinson Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and anti-F4/80-
biotin (eBiosciences, San Diego, CA) followed by incubation
with goat anti-rabbit-horseradish peroxidase (Southern
Biotechnologies, Birmingham, AL), streptavidin-Alexa fluor 647
and tyramide signal amplification (Life Technologies). Lung
was inflated and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (Sigma
Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO) overnight then embedded in paraffin.
Paraffin embedded tissues were sectioned at 5 µm, and
stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Microscopic slides were
examined and pathology score generated by a doubled blinded
board-certified veterinary pathologist. The pathology score
consisted of a range of 0-4: 0 defined as unremarkable; 1
defined as minimal changes in bronchiolar epithelium with
minimal perivascular inflammation; 2 defined as mild multifocal
bronchiolar epithelial changes with perivascular and
peribronchiolar inflammation; 3 defined as moderate, multifocal
bronchiolar epithelial changes with perivascular,
peribronchiolar and alveolar inflammation; and 4 is defined as
marked, diffuse bronchiolar epithelial changes with
perivascular, peribronchiolar and alveolar inflammation.
Cytokine array and ELISA
Cytokine profiles from BAL fluid were obtained using
Proteome profiler (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Blots were
developed according to manufacturer's protocols and
luminescence was quantitated by Alpha-Inotech bio-imaging
instrumentation and software (Protein Simple, Santa Clara,
CA). Concentrations of MIG, MCP-1, IP-10 and TIMP-1 were
confirmed by ELISA using cytokine specific ELISA kits
(PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ).
Sequencing
RNA was extracted from sucrose purified virus and cDNA
was made using Multiscribe MuLV reverse transcriptase (Life
Technologies, Grand Island, NY) and gene specific primers
described in Table S1. PCR products were cloned using TOPO
cloning vector (Life Technologies). Ten colonies were picked
and submitted for sequencing (Eurofins MWG Operon,
Huntsville, AL). Sequences were submitted to GenBank under
the accession numbers; KF527476, KF52477 (CA/07 HA),
KF52478, KF52479 (NL/602 HA), KF527480, KF527481
(CA/07 PA), KF527482 (NL/602 PA) KF527483 (CA/07 NA),
KF527484 (NL/602 NA), KF5274 85 (CA/07 NP), and
KF527486 (NL/602 NP).
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was conducted using Graph Pad Prism
(GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). Weight and pathology
scores and cytokine ELISA were analyzed by performing Two-
Way (mixed model) ANOVA test with Bonferroni post-test to
analyze the interactions between viruses and time. P-
value<0.05 was considered significant.
Results
CA/07 influenza virus exhibits 100-1000-fold greater
virulence than NL/602 virus
To investigate the pathogenic effects induced by influenza
viruses, mice were infected (i.n.) with CA/07 or NL/602. Viruses
were passaged only in MDCK cells prior to infection. Balb/c
and DBA/2 mice were inoculated with 10-fold serial dilution of
virus inocula ranging from 1-100,000 PFU. As shown in Table
1, Balb/c mice exhibit greater resistance to infection, requiring
100-1000-fold greater inoculum dose of CA/07 virus than

DBA/2 mice to confer maximum weight loss of 25%. Balb/c
mice exhibited a mean mLD50 of greater than 5,600 PFU
following infection with CA/07, compared to mLD50 of 3.8 PFU
in DBA/2 mice. Infection with up to 40,000 PFU of NL/602 did
not result in lethality in Balb/c mice and the mLD50 was 80 PFU
in DBA/2 mice. The observation that DBA/2 mice were more
sensitive to influenza virus infection is consistent with previous
studies [29]. Moreover, infection of Balb/c or DBA/2 mice with
CA/07 virus caused rapid weight loss with a maximum weight
loss of greater than 25% body weight (Figure 1A). Lethality was
observed between 2-12 days post infection (Figure S1). By
contrast, Balb/c mice that were infected with NL/602 exhibited
maximum weight loss of 5-10% and fully recovered two weeks
post-infection. Since the range in virus titers necessary to
induce maximum weight loss and the range required to elicit
lethality were broader in the Balb/c mice than DBA/2, we
selected Balb/c mice for further studies. We next evaluated
how infection with CA/07 or NL/602 virus at comparable doses
affected disease state. We chose to infect Balb/c mice with 800
PFU of either CA/07 or NL/602, as this titer did not cause high
mortality in the mice. Consistent with our previous observation,
infection with 800 PFU of NL/602 caused weight loss ranging
from 5-10% of initial body weight. In contrast, infection with 800
PFU of CA/07 virus led to 20-25% body weight loss and
lethality in 5% of the animals (Figure 1A).
The CA/07 virus and NL/602 virus share greater than
99% sequence identity
Analysis of GenBank sequences revealed only six amino
acid differences between the two strains. To confirm this and to
determine if newly generated mutations may have contributed
to the differences in the observed pathogenesis associated
with the viruses, we sequenced the genomes of our MDCK-
passaged viruses. Our results indicated that only 19 single
nucleotide polymorphisms separate these two strains. Of
these, 11 resulted in changes to the amino acid sequence
(Figure 2). Four amino acid differences were observed in the
Polymerase Acidic (PA) protein, in which S at position 190 of
the NL/602 virus was replaced by P in the CA/07 virus
(S190P). Other amino acid changes observed in the PA gene
include S224P, G349E and L581M. S190P and S244P are
newly described mutations with S190P representing 5-10% of
the CA/07 virus subset. The predominant CA/07 subset
expressed S190. G349E and L581M are consistent with
GenBank sequences CY046942 and FJ969529. Four residue
differences were found in the HA gene, three new mutations
S100P, D173N, D239G, and one previously described V338I

(CY039527 and FJ981613). D173N and D239G represent a
minor subset of the CA/07 sequence. The nucleoprotein (NP)
gene differs at D101G and I373T. D101G is a newly described
mutation distinct from CY046943 and GQ338390. V108 and
I407 in the NA gene of NL/602 virus were previously described
to reduce NA activity [30]. Consistent with GenBank sequences
CY039528 and GQ377078, we observed a change in V108I in
the NL/602 and CA/07 NA gene, respectively, however; our
sequences revealed both viruses exhibited a V at position 407,
thus only a single amino acid difference at position 108 was
observed in the NA genes of CA/07 and NL/602 strains.
Although the difference in amino acid sequence is less than
0.3%, the CA/07 strain was more virulent than the NL/602
virus. The similarity in the genetic sequence combined with the
wide range of pathogenic effects observed in pH1N1 infection,
ranging from mild to severe respiratory infection that can lead
to acute respiratory distress, makes these strains ideal to
evaluate the immunological effects while constraining the viral
components to limited sequence variability.
Extensive damage of respiratory mucosa is associated
with CA/07 virus infection
To evaluate the pathogenic effects of influenza virus
infection, Balb/c mice were infected with 800 PFU of CA/07 or
NL602 intranasally (i.n.). At two days post infection with CA/07
virus, necrosis and attenuation of respiratory epithelial cells
were observed in bronchiolar epithelium. Peribronchiolar and
perivascular inflammation and edema were multifocal in
distribution and mild in severity. Alveoli were unaffected at this
time. These marked changes continued up to four (Figure 3E)
and six days post infection with inflammation spilling into
adjacent alveolar spaces (Figure 3F). NL/602 induced similar
but less severe pathology than CA/07 (Figures 1B, 3B-C).
Several features were distinct between CA/07 and NL/602.
Initially, inflammation was localized to bronchiolar epithelium
and perivascular spaces of mice infected with CA/07. By four to
six days post infection, inflammation spilled into the adjacent
alveolar spaces and the infiltrating cells were predominantly
neutrophils and mononuclear cells (Figure 3D-F). Periodic acid-
Schiff (PAS) staining revealed hyaline membranes lining
alveolar ducts by day six post infection (Figure 3D). The
presence of hyaline membrane in the lung strongly correlates
with acute respiratory distress syndrome previously described
associated with severe influenza virus infection of 1918 H1N1
[1,6], highly pathogenic avian H5N1 [3-5,7] and in some cases
of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus [8,9]. In contrast,
inflammation was restricted to the peribronchiolar and
perivascular interstitia in lungs of mice that were infected with
NL/602 virus (Figure 3B-C) with no inflammation observed in
alveoli and hyaline membranes were not detected. Moreover,
infiltration of foamy macrophage and mononuclear cells were
more prominent following infection with NL/602 virus.
CA/07 and NL/602 viruses replicate in murine
respiratory tract with more rapid clearance of NL/602
virus than CA/07
We demonstrated that the 2009 pandemic H1N1 CA/07
strain clearly induced severe pathology in murine models

following inoculation with 800 PFU of virus, while infection with
the closely related pH1N1 NL/602 virus induced mild to
moderate disease pathogenesis. To determine if the difference
in the severity of the disease state may be related to
differences in the replication rate of these viruses, mice were
infected with 800 PFU of either the CA/07 virus or the NL/602
virus and lungs were excised and evaluated for production of
infectious viral particles, or the presence of viral RNA. Lungs
were collected at days 2, 4, 6 and 8 and weighed prior to
processing the tissues. We evaluated virus lung titers by
plaque titration on MDCK monolayers. CA/07 virus produced
over 10 fold higher titers of viral progeny than NL/602 in the
lungs after 2 days post infection but by 4-6 days post infection
total viral lung titers were similar irrespective of viral strain
(Figure 4A). A trend of decreasing virus titer was observed
after 4 days post infection and the rate of decrease accelerated
after six days in the lungs of mice that were infected with
NL/602 virus. Interestingly, at days 2 and 4, total viral M
transcript levels were indistinguishable (Figure 4B). By 6 days
post infection there was clear evidence of control of NL/602
viral RNA levels while CA/07 transcript levels remained
elevated and the animals eventually succumbed to the
infection. Peak virus titers of 73 PFU/ml from mice infected with
CA/07 and 53 PFU/ml from animals infected with NL/602 were
detected in nasal washes two days post infection. Virus was
not detected in the spleen or liver. These data indicate that
both NL/602 and CA/07 viruses were localized to the
respiratory tract and did not disseminate to the spleen and
liver.
Inflammatory cytokines and chemokines are elevated
following infection by CA/07
Infection with highly virulent strains of influenza virus such as
the pandemic 1918 H1N1 or highly pathogenic avian H5N1
leads to infection that culminates in acute respiratory distress.
A signature of these pathogenic infections is the correlation
with cytokine dysregulation [4,21,31]. We evaluated cytokine
levels in the lungs of mice that were infected with either NL/602
or CA/07. Figure 5 highlights cytokines present in BAL at two
days post infection but which were not detectible or were
present at lower concentration in naïve mice. Infection with
influenza virus resulted in increased production of several
cytokines and chemokines above concentrations observed in
BAL fluid of naïve mice. Of the 33 cytokines evaluated, we
observed several significant differences in concentrations of
cytokines detected in BAL following CA/07 or NL/602 infection.
With the exception of sICAM-1, we observed that BAL from
mice infected with CA/07 virus exhibited higher overall
concentrations of chemokines that mediate monocyte and
neutrophil recruitment than BAL from mice infected with the
NL/602 virus. These chemokines include CXCL1, CXCL2,
CCL5, CCL2, and CXCL9. To further establish the validity of
the cytokine profile, we confirmed the cytokine concentrations
by ELISA. At two and four days post infection, infection with
CA/07 virus culminated in 2-4 fold higher concentrations than
NL/602 virus of several cytokines and monokines including
monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), tissue inhibitor
of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1), interferon gamma-induced
protein 10 (IP-10) and monokine induced by interferon gamma
(MIG) (Figure 6) that are involved in regulation of tissue repair,
recruitment of monocytes, macrophages, NK cells, T cells and
activation of inflammatory responses [32-36]. In addition to
Figure 2. CA/07 and NL/602 viruses share greater than 99% amino sequence identity. Viral genomes were sequenced and
the translated amino acid sequence of the polymerase basic (A), hemagglutinin (B), nucleoprotein (C) and neuraminidase (D) are
illustrated. 10 clones from each virus and each gene segment were submitted for sequencing. Heterogeneity in the sequence was
observed and designated as CA/07.1 and CA/07.2 or NL/602.1 or NL/602.2 with the dominant sequence designated as CA/07.1 or
NL/602.1. The consensus amino acid sequences are shown. Identical residues are depicted as dots and differences in amino acid
sequence are shown.

early induction of cytokines, CA/07 infection induced two to
three-fold greater concentrations of MCP-1, TIMP-1 and MIG at
four days post-infection and two to four-fold greater
concentrations of IP-10 at two and four days post-infection with
NL/602.
Localization of viral antigen expression
Early detection and elevated concentration of cytokines that
mediate recruitment of innate cells suggest that infection with
CA/07 may induce rapid influx of innate cells to the site of
infection. Alternatively, the high virulence of CA/07 compared
to NL/602 may be explained by differences in viral tropism. To
investigate if CA/07 and NL/602 viruses targeted similar cell
types in vivo, we evaluated the expression of viral antigens and
compared the localization patterns of NP in the lungs of mice
infected with CA/07 or NL/602 viruses. At two days post
infection, NP was prominently detected on bronchiolar
epithelium of both CA/07 and NL/602 infected mice (Figure 7A-
B). At four days post-infection, viral NP antigen spread to the
adjacent alveoli (Figure 7C). This is in agreement with
observations that similar levels of viral M gene transcripts were
Figure 3. CA/07 and NL/602 induced contrasting
peribronchiolar and perivascular inflammation and hyaline
membrane formation. Lungs from naïve (A), NL/602 (B-C),
and CA/07 (D-F) infected mice were collected 4 days (B and E)
and 6 day post infection (D, C, and F) and stained by H&E (A-
C, E-F). At 6 days post infection, hyaline membranes were
present in the lungs of CA/07 infect mice (D) as indicated by
PAS stain (arrow head). Inflammation of alveolar spaces was
observed following infection with CA/07 virus (arrow). Shown
are representative lungs from of each group. N=12.

detected in the lungs of mice infected CA/07 or NL/062 (Figure
4B). The data demonstrate that CA/07 and NL/602 viruses are
initially detected in bronchiolar epithelial cells and subsequently
spread to alveolar epithelial cells, and are consistent with the
observation that inflammation initiated in the bronchioles.
Infection with CA/07 virus induced infiltration of
myeloid cells that are distinct from NL/602 virus
Although localization of CA/07 and NL/602 NP were
indistinguishable at day two, CA/07 induced significantly
greater infiltration of myeloid derived CD11bhi
cells into the
bronchioles (Figure 7B, D) and later into the alveoli. This is
consistent with our finding of elevated concentrations of
cytokines associated with innate cell recruitment (Figure 6).
The CD11Bhi
cells were frequently clustered with NP+
pneumocytes but seldom colocalized with NP. In contrast,
infection with NL/602 virus induced moderate accumulation of
CD11bhi
myeloid cells when compared to infection with CA/07
virus. Moreover, F4/80hi
alveolar macrophages were found near
NP+
pneumocytes and often colocalized with the viral antigens
as well (Figure 7D). It is possible that the F4/80hi
alveolar
macrophages may help to reduce viral load by serving as a
reservoir for viral infection without producing infectious
progeny. Alternatively, these cells may take up the virus by
phagocytosis and thus contribute to the lower viral load of
NL/602 relative to CA/07 observed at day two. It is thought that
severe inflammatory responses associated with influenza virus
infection results in the rapid and robust recruitment of newly
infiltrating cells. Infection with CA/07 virus clearly resulted in
greater influx of cells to the respiratory tract than NL/602 virus.
We show that the infiltrating cells exhibit distinct phenotype.
Discussion
In the USA annually, it is estimated that influenza epidemics
contribute to 87 billion dollars in lost revenue associated with
direct medical expense, loss of earnings due to illness and
death [37]. Vaccines are the primary preventative measure to
curtail the health and economic burden associated with
influenza. Viruses such as highly pathogenic avian influenza
H5N1 can also negatively impact the production of vaccines.
As was demonstrated with 2009 swine-origin pH1N1 virus, a
sudden emergence of a novel virus that rapidly spread across
the globe highlighted a need to treat individuals that were not
protected by vaccinations. Severe complications associated
with influenza virus infection can occur abruptly and at early
stages of viral infection, suggesting that innate immune
mechanisms participate in the immunopathology. Moreover,
exuberant innate responses play an important role in
pathogenesis of influenza infections and more complete
understanding of the mechanisms that regulate these early
events after influenza virus infection may provide better
treatment options to individuals that are infected and where
vaccines are unable to prevent infections.
We demonstrated that A/CA/07/09 and A/NL/602/09 isolates
from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic are genetically related. Only
eleven amino acids differ between the two viruses yet infection
in murine models induced distinct pathogenic effects. Infection

bronchiolar epithelial cell necrosis, hyperplasia, and hyaline

infected with CA/07. In contrast, F4/80hi
cells that colocalized
with viral NP were observed at greater frequency in the lungs
of mice infected with NL/602 virus.
We demonstrated that CA/07 and NL/602 exhibit similar
levels of viral transcripts in the lung early upon infection.
Consistent with this finding, NP was prominently expressed on
bronchiolar epithelial cells at two days following infection with
CA/07 and NL/602 and at four days post infection, viral
antigens were observed in alveolar epithelial cells.
Measurement of infectious particles by plaque assay indicated
that NL/602 exhibited 10-fold lower titer at two days post-
infection than CA/07. This difference in viral transcript level and
viral load may be explained by differences in the ability of
NL/602 and CA/07 viruses to release infectious progeny
following infection. At eight days after infection with NL/602,
reduced viral load was observed. This is likely the result of
effective clearance of the virus. The CA/07 and NL/602 viruses
induced similar cytokine profiles; however, cytokines were
detected more rapidly and at greater concentrations in the
lungs of CA/07-infected mice. This is consistent with previous
observations that infections with virulent strains of influenza
virus coincide with high concentration of cytokines in the lungs
[4,21,31]. The early and exuberant level of cytokines in the lung
corresponds with the recruitment of CD11bhi
cells into the
lungs.
In cases of severe influenza virus infection, loss of
respiratory function, reduced blood oxygenation and
destruction of Type I and Type II pneumocytes can occur and

progress to acute respiratory distress [38]. Destruction of
respiratory epithelial cells occurs as the direct result of
influenza induced cell death and indirectly as monocytes and
macrophages induce apoptosis and eventual phagocytosis of
infected cells [39]. As a primary target of influenza virus, airway
epithelial cells produce inflammatory cytokines upon infection
[40]. These include IFN- and TNF- which can stimulate local
inflammatory response and activation of chemokines and
monokines such as MCP-1, MIP-1 and RANTES which recruit
monocytes, macrophages and neutrophils. Secretion of these
cytokines and chemokines is exacerbated upon infection with
H5N1 [19], and 1918 reassortant viruses [3]. Newly recruited
macrophage and monocytes to inflamed lungs are
subsequently infected by virus, further reinforcing the cytokine
cascade.
Monocytes and macrophages exhibit tremendous plasticity.
They exhibit pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory properties
and are characterized by expression of cell surface markers
including F4/80 and CD11b [41]. Depletion of phagocytes with
liposome encapsulated with chlodronate prior to infection with
non-virulent influenza virus leads to elevated viral load and viral
mediated damage of the respiratory epithelium [42]. In contrast,
excessive recruitment of alveolar macrophages to the lung also
leads to epithelial destruction [39]. These data demonstrate
that phagocytic macrophages are necessary for the control and
clearance of influenza virus but also are directly involved in the
destruction of the respiratory epithelium. Our data suggest that
CD11b+
cell recruitment correlates with severe
immunopathology observed following inoculation with CA/07
and F4/80+
cells correlate with moderate pathology associated
with NL/602.
Complications often arise as a result of highly robust
responses by innate cells leading to excessive destruction of
the infected tissues. In severe influenza respiratory infection,
this manifests as cytokine dysregulation. The damaging effects
of infiltrating cells can be reversed by reducing the
concentration of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. This
was demonstrated by inhibiting S1P1 receptors on endothelial
cells which dramatically reduces cytokine production resulting
in a marked reduction of mononuclear cell infiltration and
damage of the respiratory epithelium [43]. Although controlling
and preventing cytokine dysregulation can have beneficial
impact and alleviate pathology, cytokines are also critical for
the control and clearance of virus. BJx109; a reassortant virus
bearing the surface glycoproteins A/Beijing/353/89 and core
proteins derived from A/PR/8/34, readily infects peritoneal
cavity macrophages and induce greater production of cytokines
than infection with PR/8 virus. Peritoneal macrophages secrete
cytokines and recruit leukocytes that also mediate clearance of
BJx109 virus. Lower threshold levels of cytokine production
and leukocyte recruitment by PR/8 virus lead to uncontrolled
viral replication [44]. We have demonstrated that CA/07 and
NL/602 infection lead to infiltration of phenotypically distinct
cells of the myeloid lineage. While neutrophils are amongst the
infiltrating cells in the lungs of mice infected with CA/07 virus,
large subsets were monocytes and macrophages. These cells
may exhibit more pathogenic features following infection with
CA/07 while the recruitment of cells that mediate immune

regulation or suppression are more prominent following
infection with NL/602. Future studies will continue to investigate
how these cells interact with viruses and their roles in
regulating immunopathology.
Viral replication and virulence are multifaceted processes
and it is thought that high virus titers correlate with severe
pathogenesis. For example, reassortant viruses expressing the
HA and NA from the 1918 virus are highly virulent [13] and
exhibit high viral load in lungs of infected animals. However
viral titers were obtained from animals during the terminal
stage of infection. In contrast, reassortants with the NS1 gene
from 1918 virus are attenuated and exhibit lower viral load [45].
It is possible that differences in NS1 and or NEP protein
interaction with cellular, or other viral proteins, or reduced
protein stability contributes to the attenuation and reduce viral
load. H5N1 virus infects primary culture obtained from human
upper and lower respiratory tract including the nasopharynx,
adenoid and tonsil as opposed to seasonal influenza which is
primarily observed in the nasopharynx [16]. pH1N1 viruses
were also shown to infect human respiratory tract and
conjunctival epithelium while seasonal influenza viruses did not
exhibit replication in conjunctival tissues [46]. These data
suggest that high viral titers correlate with severe pathology.
Administration of neutralizing antibodies against TNF- [47]
and pharmacological agonist to S1P1 receptor [43,48] can
ameliorate immunopathology by reducing the damaging effects
of cytokine storm and tissue destruction without affecting viral
load. These data suggest that while controlling viral replication
is critical and can contribute to alleviating immunopathology, it
is possible that immune-mediated tissue destruction also
contributes to the pathology.
Pathogenesis is a multifaceted process that involves
immune-dependent processes and virus-dependent processes.
Viruses adapt to the immune system and host cell machinery
by sequential mutations that enhance viral replication and
transmission. Mutations in viral genes can also influence viral
tropism and interactions with cellular proteins to inhibit innate
and or cell mediated detection. Virus strains obtained during
the 2009 pH1N1 provide a useful model to evaluate immune-
modulators of pathogenesis while naturally constraining the
genetics of the virus to only 11 amino acid differences. This
study thus opens up new possibilities to evaluate viral genetic
determinants of pathogenesis. Similarly, the limited genetic
differences between CA/07 and NL/602 allows for further
definition of immune-determinants of pathogenesis.
