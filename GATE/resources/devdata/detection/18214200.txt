Possible Avian
Influenza (H5N1)
from Migratory
Bird, Egypt
To the Editor: Wild migratory
birds are reservoirs for low pathogenic
avian influenza (LPAI) viruses (1), but
their role in transmitting highly patho-
genic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses
is hotly debated and unclear (2­4). Be-
ginning in July 2005, a clade of HPAI
(H5N1) viruses rapidly expanded from
an apparent focus in western People's
Republic of China and spread to the
Middle East, Africa, and Europe (5).
Genetic analysis of HPAI virus iso-
lates from dead wild birds along major
flyways indicated that the strains were
closely related to the Qinghai H5N1
A/bar-headed goose/Qinghai/65 /2005
virus (clade II) (GenBank accession
no. DQ095622). In addition to trans-
mission to domestic poultry, HPAI
(H5N1)­infected mute swans have
been implicated in direct transmission
to humans in Azerbaijan (6).
The US Naval Medical Research
Unit No. 3 and the Ministry of Envi-
ronment of Egypt have collaborated
since 2003 in obtaining samples from
migratory birds to detect circulating
influenza viruses. During the 2005­06
migratory birds season, 1,304 migra-
tory birds were sampled from either
live bird markets or cage birds trapped
by fishermen in Port Said, Damietta,
Fayoum, Arish, and Sharm el Sheikh
(online Appendix Figure, panel A,
available from www.cdc.gov/EID/
content/13/7/1120-appG.htm).
A total of 203 cloacal swab sam-
ples were positive for influenzaAvirus
matrix gene when tested by real-time
PCR, and 2 were also positive for the
hemagglutinin 5 (H5) gene by using
specific primers (7). Of the 2 migra-
tory birds positive for the H5 gene, the
first was a common teal (Anas crec-
ca) captured in the Nile Delta region
of Damietta in October 2005 (online
Appendix Figure, panel A). Sequenc-
ing of the H5 gene showed that this
virus was an LPAI most closely re-
lated to strain A/mallard/Bavaria/1/
2005(H5N2) (GenBank accession no.
DQ387854 (2).
In January 2006, an influenza A
H5 virus (weak positive result) was
detected in another common teal
(trapped in a cage by a fisherman)
sampled from the Damietta region
in December 2005 (online Appendix
Figure, panel A). The low viral load,
coupled with the failure to isolate the
virus, precluded the laboratory from
conducting sequence analysis at the
time on the basis of insufficient tem-
plate material. After the outbreak of
influenza A (H5N1) in poultry and
humans in Egypt in February 2006,
additional retrospective attempts to
concentrate RNA were used to as-
sess potential introduction scenarios.
After multiple RNA extractions were
conducted and the RNA was concen-
trated, this specimen was found to be
positive for the neuraminidase 1 (N1)
gene by real-time PCR.
The hemagglutinin gene from
both teal strains was sequenced
(1,596 bp). Sequences were aligned
with other influenza A (H5N1) strains
from Egypt (9 from humans, 5 from
chickens). Twenty other strains with
high similarity and from different lo-
cations were selected by using a Gen-
Bank search algorithm and included in
the alignment.Aphylogenetic analysis
was conducted by using the Kimura
2-parameter model. The LPAI H5 vi-
rus strain was used as an outgroup in
a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree.
Bootstrap analysis with 500 replicates
of sequence data was also conducted
by using MEGA 3.1 software (8).
Phylogenetic analysis showed
clustering of the HPAI (H5N1) strains
collected from 1 geographic region
(country) (online Appendix Figure,
panel B). All HPAI (H5N1) strains
from Egypt from humans or chickens
analyzed clustered with a bootstrap
supportvalueof98%.Furthermore,the

(H5N1) strain (collected in December
2005; online Appendix Figure, panel
A) is an HPAI and is closely related
to the parent of the group of viruses
isolated in the early 2006 Egypt out-
break, with an average identity of
99.4% with all other strains from
Egypt and a bootstrap support value of
96% (online Appendix Figure, panel
B). Despite the rapid spread of this
clade (Qinghai-like strain) to many
countries, since late 2005, strains ana-
lyzed in this study showed low-level
genetic variation (<2%).
Brown et al. reported that spe-
cies can vary greatly in their response
to HPAI (9). At least in ducks, it ap-
pears that viral shedding is highest in
birds with clinical signs of infection,
and lowest, as seen in the common
teal infected with the HPAI strain in
this study, in birds with subclinical in-
fections. These subclinical infections
may be due to flock immunity from
previous exposure to LPAI H5 virus
or genetic factors. This suggestion is
conceivable in light of the LPAI H5
virus detected in the other teal a few
months earlier.
Such naturally resistant wild birds
might serve as vectors for introduction
of HPAI viruses into new locations.
Data presented herein suggest that an
HPAI virus may have been introduced
into Egypt through a migratory bird.
Whether poultry were infected before
mid-February or the teal was infected
with influenza A (H5N1) virus by a
domesticated species is not unknown.
The low degree of viral shedding in-
dicates that detection of any influenza
A (H5N1) virus in wild birds in a new
region should be immediately fol-
lowed up with efforts to characterize
the virus to control the spread of new
subtypes/strains of HPAI into new lo-
cations.

Community-

Producers,
United States
To the Editor: Extended-spec-
trum -lactamase (ESBL)­producing
organisms have become a common
problem for patients in hospitals and
other healthcare facilities (1). Com-
munity-onset ESBL infections have
recently been described in Spain, the
United Kingdom, Israel, and Canada
(2,3). Typically, the infections are uri-
nary tract infections (UTIs) with CTX-
M­producing Escherichia coli. These
organisms may be resistant to most
or all antimicrobial agents commonly
used to treat UTIs, such as ciprofloxa-
cin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole,
gentamicin, and ceftriaxone.
Although CTX-M­producing E.
coli have previously been found in the
United States (4), clinical descriptions
of community-acquired ESBL-pro-
ducing E. coli infections have not been
reported in this country. We describe 2
healthy young women in Pennsylvania
in whom UTI with CTX-M-15­pro-
ducing E. coli developed.
A 25-year-old woman was seen
in October 2006 at the emergency de-
partment of a hospital in Pittsburgh
reporting frequent urination, chills,
and bilateral back pain. She had no
relevant past medical history except
for previous UTIs. Results of a physi-
cal examination were unremarkable.
