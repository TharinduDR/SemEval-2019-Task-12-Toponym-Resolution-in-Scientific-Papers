Why was the cohort established?
For breast cancer, like most other common diseases, having a family history of the disease is associated with an
increased risk. There is large heterogeneity in absolute and
relative breast cancer risks associated with family history,
depending on the age of the woman, the age(s) at diagnosis
of her affected relative(s) and the genetic relationship(s).
Women with one affected first-degree relative are on average at 2-fold increased risk of breast cancer relative to
women with no first-degree family history, and this increases to 4-fold for women with three or more affected
first-degree relatives1.
Under a multiplicative risk model, the underlying risk
distribution must be highly skewed, and most women in
the population are well below average risk; see Figure 1,

which illustrates the difference between women unselected
for familial or genetic risk (blue line) and women enriched
for familial/genetic risk (dotted red line). Given that epidemiological studies make inference about risk for the controls, almost all existing knowledge about risk factors is
not relevant to ‘women at average risk’, but to women at
lower than average risk. It is not known if this knowledge
applies to women at increased, if not high, risk. To find
evidence relevant to women across the full continuum of
risk, with the potential for targeted risk modification and
prevention, we have established and genetically-characterised a large prospective family-based cohort enriched for
familial risk.
Over the past two decades, an increasing number of
genetic risk factors have been identified.2,3 Nevertheless,
the majority of women with a family history of breast

Figure 1. Comparison of the theoretical distribution of familial risk profile (FRP) for women from the general population (blue line) and for those affected with either early-onset breast cancer or unaffected but with a strong family history of breast cancer, equivalent to a 3-fold increased risk (dotted

cancer, even those with a strong family history, do not
have causal mutations in the known genes, and large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and now next-generation sequencing efforts are identifying additional
genetic risk factors.4–10
Epidemiological evidence suggests that some environmental factors modify breast cancer risk for women with a
family history. Most epidemiology studies, however, record only first-degree family history as a binary factor
(e.g.1,11,12), which does not capture the potential importance of disease in second-degree and more distant relatives,13–15 and rarely take into account the importance of
age at diagnosis of affected relatives. The few studies
that do16,17 suggest greater environmental and genetic
heterogeneity in risk.
One approach to studying gene-environment interactions is to consider a woman’s underlying familial risk
profile (FRP), representing her inherent lifetime risk due to
familial determinants. A woman’s FRP can be predicted
from her multi-generational family history including the
number of affected relatives and her relationship with each
affected relative, their age(s) at diagnosis, and if known,
her genetic risk status (including causal variants and
markers associated with risk) and the genetic risk status of
her relatives.
It is not well recognised that there must be very large
variation in FRP. Given the increased risks associated with
having a family history, mathematical models predict that,
as a group, women in the top 25% of FRP must be at least
20 times more likely to develop breast cancer than women
in the bottom 25% of FRP.18,19 Nevertheless, unlike
matching on age to control for its strong effect on cancer
risk, epidemiological studies rarely match well by design or

analysis on FRP, even though cases and controls differ
greatly by FRP, especially in the upper tail.
Environmental and genetic effects may have different effects in women with increased FRP. Studies of such ‘geneenvironment interactions’ for which controls are better
matched to cases for FRP, and even for mutations in specific genes—either by design or by analyses that use good
predictors of FRP—might be more informative, especially
if both cases and controls are over-sampled for increased
familial risk. They also have greater validity if they are prospective.18,19 Few prospective studies of families exist.
They include the Minnesota Breast Cancer Family Study
(544 families), established in the 1950s,20–23 and the USAbased Sisters Study (50 844 unaffected sisters of affected
women aged 35–74 years).24 Family-based cohorts are also
important for novel behavioural, psychosocial and health
care utilization research, such as attitudes and practices regarding screening and risk reduction, and for the translation of primary, secondary and tertiary prevention findings
into clinical practice.25–28
In the mid-1990s,when two major susceptibility genes,
BRCA1 and BRCA2, were discovered, the Breast Cancer
Family Registry (BCFR),29 and the Kathleen Cuningham
Foundation Consortium for research into Familial Breast
cancer (kConFab)30 (in 2001 the kConFab FUP started31)
were established. Importantly, both the BCFR and the
kConFab were designed from the outset so that they could
generate cohorts from which data could be pooled; they
used the same baseline questionnaire and have conducted
regular active follow-up of families. In mid-2014, a systematic follow-up of both the BCFR and kConFab FUP was
completed as part of an NIH-funded grant to study the
following aims using a prospective family study cohort

International Journal of Epidemiology, 2016, Vol. 45, No. 3

(ProF-SC) (CA159868): (i) estimate age-specific absolute
risks of breast cancer; (ii) estimate relative risks associated
with modifiable factors and test whether these associations
vary by FRP; and (iii) develop and internally validate comprehensive clinical breast cancer risk assessment models
for women across the spectrum of breast cancer risk.

Who is in the cohort?
The ProF-SC includes all female participants in the BCFR
or kConFab FUP who were enrolled before 30 June 2011
and completed a baseline questionnaire. A total of 31 640
women from 11 171 families, 11.4% of whom are
Ashkenazi Jewish, completed the same baseline
questionnaire.
The BCFR recruited families from six sites; one in
Australia, one in Canada and four in the USA. The
Australian, Canadian and Northern Californian sites recruited population-based case families using cancer registries. kConFab and the Australian BCFR recruited cases
unselected for family history, over-sampling for early age
at diagnosis, whereas the other two population-based sites
used a two-stage sampling scheme, over-sampling for early
age at diagnosis and/or having a family history or other
predictors of a genetic predisposition. The Northern
California site over-sampled racial/ethnic minority families. The New York, Philadelphia, Utah, Canadian and
Australian sites recruited multiple-case families through
family cancer clinics and community outreach.
kConFab recruited multi-generational, multiple-case
families through cancer family clinics in Australia and
New Zealand.30,31 The eligibility criteria for recruitment
of families evolved over time and were intended to maximise the number of living potentially high-risk women,
including known BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers,
whether or not they had been diagnosed with breast
cancer.
Although ascertainment issues sometimes require separate analyses of population-based and clinic-ascertained
families for retrospective studies, for prospective studies all
unaffected family members can be combined into a single
cohort because all families are being followed using the
same methods and their members have been studied using
the same protocol at baseline. A family cohort is in contrast to conventional cohort studies in which the vast majority of incident cases do not have a family history, at
least not for first- or second-degree relatives. A large proportion of the ProF-SC cohort was affected at baseline,
which also facilitates studies on risk factors for subsequent
primary breast cancer, including contralateral disease.
Table 1 describes the baseline characteristics of ProFSC, illustrating wide variation in demographics, family

history and other risk factors. Table 2 summarises the distribution of the incident breast cancer cases diagnosed
since baseline. There is a wide distribution in age at diagnosis, with cases diagnosed before age 50 years accounting
for 34% in the sub-cohort of women unaffected at baseline
and 28% in the sub-cohort of women affected at baseline,
respectively. For both these sub-cohorts, a high proportion
of incident cases have been confirmed through pathology
records (78% and 71%, respectively) and a high proportion have DNA available (88% and 95%, respectively).

How often have they been followed up?
The family-based design facilitates follow-up primarily
through tracing and updates of vital status using multiple
informants, thereby increasing the validity of the cohort’s
data on outcomes and family cancer history.32 Since baseline, there has been regular contact with families through
BCFR and kConFab newsletters and websites. Vital and
cancer statuses have been updated through phone interviews, mailed questionnaires, clinic visits and linkages to
cancer registries. In addition, there have been systematic
updates of risk factor and clinical outcomes data (see
below for details).
High participation at follow-up is a critical issue for the
validity of cohort studies, and we have demonstrated that
this can be achieved by using a family-based design with
multiple contacts typically available for each cohort member. Of the 31 640 women in the cohort, after an average
of 9 years of follow-up, 11% were no longer living, 5% no
longer wished to participate in follow-up and 14% have
been lost to follow-up. Table 1 shows that baseline characteristics are similar for those lost to follow-up or no longer
participating in active follow-up and those who have remained active. For those lost to follow-up and/or who
dropped out of active follow-up, we have information on
vital status, including cancer history, for 63% from their
participating relatives.

What has been measured?
For all ProF-SC members, the BCFR and kConFab have
collected detailed family history, demographic and risk factor data and biospecimens, regardless of their breast cancer
history. For all women with breast cancer, pathology records, archived tumour tissue and self-reported information on cancer treatment have been sought (Table 3).
Family history/pedigrees. Pedigree information includes
age at diagnosis of all cancers (except non-melanoma skin
cancer) and deaths for first- and second-degree relatives of
all participants (not just probands). This provides the most

comprehensive description of family history of any epidemiological breast cancer study.
Risk factor questionnaires. The BCFR and kConFab used
the same baseline questionnaire to collect data on menstrual
and reproductive history, medical history and behavioral
factors. The BCFR conducted a systematic follow-up beginning in 2007, and collected updated information on personal
and family history of cancer, breast and ovarian surgeries
and breast cancer risk factors collected at baseline. New
items of interest were added, including screening behaviours

such as use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), use of
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and
knowledge and understanding of genetic test results. The
most recent systematic follow-up of the BCFR, conducted in
2011–14, updated some risk factor data in addition to family history and pedigree information. kConFab FUP surveyed
participants every 3 years, using questionnaires that cover
the same content as the BCFR follow-up questionnaires,
with the exception of diagnostic radiation.
Biospecimen collection. At baseline, depending on relationship to the proband, most women were asked by the BCFR
and kConFab to provide either a blood or a buccal sample.
As a result, for 83% of ProF-SC there are banked DNA and
plasma samples, and for an additional 2% there is DNA
from buccal samples. There are no major differences between
women who gave blood and those who did not with regard
to the characteristics in Table 1 (data not shown).
BRCA1 and BRCA2 genotyping. Screening for germline
BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations and other known or putative susceptibility variations in other genes has been undertaken by the BCFR and kConFab, as previously
described.29,33,34 The cohort includes 1508 (844 BRCA1,
658 BRCA2, 6 both BRCA1 and BRCA2) female
carriers from the BCFR, and 1233 (670 BRCA1, 561
BRCA2, 2 both BRCA1 and BRCA2) female carriers from
kConFab.
Outcome information. We have collected pathology reports
for 74% of prospectively ascertained (incident) cases to date.
The BCFR collected self-reported treatment data using a validated questionnaire addressing stage and the type of initial
breast cancer treatments (surgery, radiation treatment, endocrine treatment and chemotherapy).35,36 The Australian,
Canadian and Utah sites of the BCFR regularly link to

688

population-based cancer registries to validate cancers
reported during follow-up. Linkage to death registries in
Australia and Canada has been used to update vital status
and related information (date and cause of death) as well as
the National Death Index for the USA-based sites.

What has it found?
To empirically evaluate the differences in breast cancer
risk estimates from different constructs of family history,

we compared standard ways of defining family history
with estimates using full family history pedigrees (Table 4).
For the more than 18 000 women unaffected at baseline,
we compared family history as typically defined by cohort
studies [any affected first-degree relative(s); yes/no] with
that of the number of affected first-degree relatives, and
with the more comprehensive family history measure
of FRP based on the Breast and Ovarian Analysis of
Disease Incidence and Carrier Estimation Algorithm
(BOADICEA)47 model (10-year predicted risk). We fitted

an age-adjusted proportional hazards model and found
that all measures predicted risk. As we compare binary categorical, ordered categorical and continuous constructs of
family history, the v2 statistics (based on the change in log
likelihood which allows comparisons across constructs)
showed that the BOADICEA score was clearly the best predictor of risk (v2 ¼ 523 for BOADICEA vs v2 ¼ 18 for
ever/never family history) in that it captures more information on risk. After fitting the BOADICEA score, the
strengths of the associations with the other two predictors
were approximately halved, whereas the association with
the BOADICEA score was virtually unchanged. Therefore,
there is also scope for the BOADICEA model to be
improved as a measure of FRP.
Figure 2 shows the predicted remaining lifetime risk
based on BOADICEA for the sub-cohort of women unaffected at baseline. This illustrates the large range in risk
and therefore why ProF-SC can be used to develop risk
models which consider modification of risk by underlying
FRP for women across the risk continuum.
These results suggest that the range of risk across ProfSC participants is large, which will be essential for prospectively validating many of the retrospective findings from our
families, including the importance of biomarkers that
change over the life course (such as DNA repair phenotype,
telomere length, oxidative stress and DNA methylation
markers) in high-risk women.37,38 We have also investigated
environmental modifiers of risk for carriers of BRCA1 and
BRCA2 mutations using retrospective data, and found a

positive association with smoking39 but no association with
alcohol intake,40 oral contraceptive use41,42 or medical diagnostic radiation.43 These studies suggest that it might be
misleading to extrapolate findings about cancer risk factors
from studying the general population to BRCA1 and
BRCA2 mutation carriers or other sub-populations of
women at increased familial/genetic risk. We are currently
working to prospectively validate these finding using ProFSC, with the aim of identifying modifiable risk factors for
women across the full spectrum of risk.44
A key goal of ProF-SC is to validate and extend risk
assessment models that predict breast cancer risk and are
used in clinics and elsewhere. Most models, such as the
BCRAT or Gail model,45 have been developed for average
risk populations and do not incorporate extensive data on
family history of breast cancer or BRCA1 and BRCA2
mutation status. Exceptions are the International Breast
Cancer Intervention Study (IBIS, or the Tyrer-Cuzick
model)46 and the BOADICEA.47 Using data from the
New York site of the BCFR, we have observed large
discordances across models,48,50 for example predictions
from the IBIS model were generally closer to the observed
number of events than predictions using BCRAT even
for the women considered to be at average risk (e.g. those
with no family history and no BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation).48 Using data from the Australian site of the BCFR,
we have shown that BOADICEA is well calibrated and
has good discrimination and accuracy at the individual
level.49

identified 1093 and 1252 women with incident breast

As shown above, a family-based cohort over-sampled for
increased familial risk has many strengths including: (i)
enrichment on outcome so that fewer individuals need be
followed, and/or for a shorter time, in order to have the
same statistical power as a cohort unselected for risk; (ii)
ensuring the cohort covers a large range of risk; (iii) ability
to identify environmental and genetic modifiers of risk for
women at higher than average risk; and (iv) better retention through having multiple family contacts. From a practical perspective, however, family studies can be
challenging because additional layers of protocol and privacy need to be considered. Care also has to be taken to
ensure that information is not inadvertently passed to other
family members. These issues, however, can be handled
through study protocols and training, and we strongly
believe that the benefits of a family cohort far outweigh its
limitations and that this design should be considered when
conducting aetiological research focused on environmental
modifiers across the risk spectrum.

Profile in a nutshell
• ProF-SC is a prospective cohort study of 31 640

women from 11 171 families ascertained through
population-based and clinic-based sampling and
who cover the full spectrum of familial risk. The
study is designed to use pedigree and genetic data
to predict the underlying familial risk profile (FRP) of
each participant and determine if risk associations
differ according to FRP, thereby informing targeted
risk modification and prevention.
• Recruitment commenced in 1992 and families were

from the USA, Canada and Australia. At baseline
this cohort of women over the age of 18 years
included 18 853 unaffected and 12 787 affected with
breast cancer, of whom 2741 are BRCA1 or BRCA2
mutation carriers.
• The most recent follow-up was completed in 2014

and included updating family cancer histories from
multiple sources; 5% have withdrawn and 14% were
lost to follow-up. Over on average 9 years, we have

cancers among those at baseline who were unaffected and affected, respectively.
• Multi-generational

cancer

family

histories

were

sought from all participants who were administered
the

questionnaire.

Blood samples have been collected from 83%, and
another 2% have DNA available through buccal samples, of participants and used for extensive genetic
characterisation.
