Advanced uracil DNA glycosylase-
supplemented real-time reverse
transcription loop-mediated
isothermal amplification (UDG-rRT-
LAMP) method for universal and
specific detection ofTembusu virus
Yi Tang, Hao Chen &Youxiang Diao
Tembusu virus (TMUV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus which threatens both poultry production and
public health. In this study we developed a complete open reading frame alignment-based rRT-LAMP
method for the universal detection ofTUMV.To prevent false-positive results, the reaction was
supplemented with uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG) to eliminate carryover contamination.The detection
limit of the newly developed UDG-rRT-LAMP forTMUV was as low as 100 copies/reaction of viral RNA
and 1 × 100.89
 − 1 × 101.55
tissue culture infectious dose/100 μL of viruses.There were no cross-reactions
with other viruses, and the reproducibility of the assay was confirmed by intra- and inter-assay tests
with variability ranging from 0.22–3.33%.The new UDG-rRT-LAMP method forTMUV produced the
same results as viral isolation combined with RT-PCR as the “gold standard” in 96.88% of cases for 81
clinical samples from subjects with suspectedTMUV infection.The addition of UDG can eliminate as
much as 1 × 10−16
 g/reaction of contaminants, which can significantly reduce the likelihood of false-
positive results during the rRT-LAMP reaction.Our result indicated that our UDG-rRT-LAMP is a rapid,
sensitive, specific, and reliable method that can effectively prevent carryover contamination in the
detection ofTMUV.
Tembusu virus (TUMV) belongs to the Ntaya virus group in the genus Flavivirus and family Flaviviridae1
. The
TMUV particle is approximately 50–60 nm in diameter and a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome is
packaged by the capsid protein into a nucleocapsid surrounded by a lipid envelope from host cells2,3
. The 5′​
capped TMUV genome is approximately 11 kb in length and has one open reading frame (ORF) encoding a
single 3410-amino acid residue polyprotein. ORF is flanked by approximately 145- nucleotide (nt) 5′​and 618-nt
3′​non-translated regions4,5
. The N-terminus of the genome encodes three structural proteins, namely capsid,
envelope (E), and precursor of membrane. Seven non-structural (NS) proteins, NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A,
NS4B, and NS54
, which are essential for viral replication, are encoded by the remainder of the genome6
. Among
these proteins, NS5 is the largest and most conserved protein and it plays essential roles in viral genome capping
and replication processes through its N-terminal methyltransferase domain and C-terminal RNA-dependent
RNA polymerase (RdRP) domain, respectively. NS5 has been popular for the universal detection of many other
flaviviruses7,8
.
TMUV was first reported and named during an arbovirus surveillance study in the 1970s in Malaysia, and
the main virus vector was found to be Culex mosquitoes9
. Humans and birds were considered to be infrequently
infected with TMUV at that time10
. Subsequently, a TMUV strain (designated as Sitiawan virus) was isolated
from sick broiler chicks in chicken embryos, and it was found to cause encephalitis, growth retardation, and

increased blood glucose levels in infected chickens11
. Since 2010, a highly contagious disease has spread through-
out most breeder, layer, and meat-type duck farms in China, causing significant economic losses in the Chinese
duck industry2
. In addition to ducks, TMUVs are commonly detected in other domestic and wild avian species
including geese12
, layer chicken13
, pigeons14
, and house sparrows3
. TMUV-infected birds exhibit various disease
conditions as documented in the literature; in particular, high fever, loss of appetite, severe reduction in egg
production, and/or severe neurologic disorders were commonly observed in TMUV-affected flocks1
. Our pre-
vious study indicated that TMUV-specific antibodies and viral RNA could be detected in duck farm workers
in China during the disease outbreak in ducks15
. Although TMUV has not been reported to cause illness in
humans, TMUV still has a high potential to evolve into a zoonotic pathogen that threatens public health as a
mosquito-borne flavivirus. Therefore, a rapid and accurate method for diagnosing TMUV infections is important
for disease control measures.
In general, TMUV is isolated using embryonated duck/chicken eggs4,16
, primary duck/chicken embryo cell
cultures2,17
, mammalian cell lines, and mosquito cell lines18
for initial virology diagnosis purposes. Serological
methods of virus neutralization19
, ELISA20–22
, and fluorescent antibody23
tests are also commonly used for the
detection of TMUV antigens or specific antibodies. These TMUV routine virology and serology tests are useful,
but they are time-consuming and have low-sensitivity issues. The nucleic acid amplification tests of conventional
RT-PCR (cRT-PCR)1,11
, nested RT-PCR, and semi-nested RT-PCR24
for specific TMUV genes have been effec-
tively used for the rapid diagnosis of TMUV infection since their development during the TMUV-related disease
outbreak in the late 1990s and in recent years. Furthermore, SYBR® Green and TaqMan® real-time RT-PCR
(rRT-PCR)25,26
and reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP)27,28
targeting spe-
cific TMUV genes were reported for more rapid and sensitive detection of TMUV infections. The advantages
of RT-LAMP assays for TMUV detection in field situations or poorly equipped laboratories were previously
reported by our group and other groups24,29
. However, there were two main limitations of the application of
RT-LAMP for TMUV detection: i) most of these developed RT-LAMP assays were based on the sequences of
historical TMUV strains, and thus, they were limited to TMUV reference strains of similar origin (duck, goose,
or chicken), making them unsuitable for detecting divergent TMUV strains from various hosts or genotyping
groups; and ii) the high sensitivity of RT-LAMP assays can easily lead to false-positive results due to carryover
contamination caused particularly by aerosol droplets generated during the assay process30
. Fortunately, carry-
over contamination in the nucleotide amplification reaction could be eliminated using uracil DNA glycosylase
(UDG) to process the dUTP-incorporated amplicons31–33
. However, there is no report describing the integration
of RNA template-based RT-LAMP amplification with UDG digestion in a one-pot reaction to eliminate carryover
contaminants. Therefore, the objective of this study was to develop a carryover contamination-free rRT-LAMP
assay for the rapid and universal detection of various TMUV strains.
Results
The rRT-LAMP primer set for the universal detection of TMUVs.  The current UDG-rRT-LAMP
assay was designed to detect all TUMV genotype groups/sub-groups. We identified a conserved region among all
representatives from different TMUV genotypes corresponding to the 3′​end of the NS5 gene using the mVISTA
method (Fig. 1A). This conserved region was located in the RdRP domain from genome position 9,793 to 10,003

(numbering corresponds to the complete genome of strain YY5, GenBank accession No. JF270480) (Fig. 1A).
The 210-bp conserved region alignment of different TMUV strains was conducted using the ClustalW method
(Fig. 1B), resulting in an overall alignment score exceeding 99%. Based on the complete ORF and NS5 conserved
region alignment results, four primers targeting six different regions in the NS5 gene RdRP domain (Table 1) were
designed, and the six primer-targeted regions were 100% conserved among different TMUV reference strains
(Fig. 1B).
UDG-rRT-LAMP reaction.  The developed UDG-rRT-LAMP is a one-pot, two-step assay for the specific
detection of TMUV and elimination of carryover contamination. Compared with the RT-LAMP assay, our devel-
oped assay was supplemented with dUTP, which can incorporate dUTP into all RT-LAMP amplicons after ampli-
fying the target RNA sequence under certain conditions (Table 2). Such processing was considered the first step
for carryover contamination elimination (Fig. 2A). To digest the dUTP incorporated RT-LAMP products, UDG
treatment was performed before isothermal amplification in step 2 (Fig. 2B), whereas the template RNA and
carryover contamination of non-dUTP incorporated RT-LAMP amplicons could not be digested under this step
(Fig. 2B).
Sensitivity and specificity.  The sensitivity of the UDG-rRT-LAMP assay was studied by testing each of the
10-fold serial dilutions of the transcribed NS5 RdRP domain RNA of the TMUV-SD2010 strain and extracted
RNA from 10-fold serial dilutions of titrated TMUV viruses. As a result, the UDG-rRT-LAMP assay for the

 −​ 1 ×​ 101.55
TCID50 of different Shandong TUMV field variant strains from different hosts
(Table 3). The detection limit of the cRT-PCR for TMUV was determined on the same viral RNA samples in
UDG-rRT-LAMP tests for comparison between the two assays. The detection limits of cRT-PCR were 1 ×​ 102.17
 −​
1 ×​ 104.55
TCID50, indicating that the assay was 10–1000-fold less sensitive than UDG-rRT-LAMP. In addition,
triplicate sensitivity tests of UDG-rRT-LAMP were performed, and the average Tt values of different dilutions
were used to generate the standard curve plots (Fig. 3C). An extremely close linear correlation was observed
between the Log of the NS5 gene copy numbers and the Tt values (R2
 =​ 0.998), with a regression line revealing an
average intercept of 50.46 ±​ 0.32 and an average slope of −​4.23 ±​ 0.06.
To determine the specificity of UDG-rRT-LAMP in detecting TMUV, six other avian pathogens and negative
control samples (allantoic fluid from SPF duck embryo) were included in specificity tests. No amplification signal
was observed with avian influenza virus (AIV) subtypes H5N1 and H9N2, Newcastle disease virus (NDV), avian
orthoreovirus (ARV), duck circovirus (DuCV), duck hepatitis A virus (DHAV), or the negative control (Fig. 3B,
upper), or the negative control (Fig. 3B, upper). To further confirm the developed assay have no cross-reactions
with non-TMUV flaviviruses, the synthesized last 1500 bp NS5 gene of Bagaza virus (BAGV), Israel turkey
meningoencephalomyelitis virus (ITV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), West Nile virus (WNV), tick-borne
encephalitis virus (TBEV), and yellow fever virus (YFV) in pUC57 vector were also included in specificity test
and no amplification signal was observed with these simulated viral nucleic acid samples (Fig. 3B, lower). Above
results indicated that the developed UDG-rRT-LAMP assay has high specificity.
Reproducibility.  To evaluate the reproducibility of the developed UDG-rRT-LAMP method, samples
containing concentrations of transcribed NS5 gene RNA of the TMUV-SD2010 strain ranging from 0.5 ×​ 102
to 0.5 ×​ 107 
copies/μ​
L were tested in replicates of three in the same run (intra-assay) and individually in three

UDG-rRT-LAMP eliminates carryover contamination via two steps. (A) The first step of the incorporation of
dUTP in all LAMP amplicons. (B) The second step of UDG-based elimination of carryover contaminants by
specifically cutting the LAMP amplicon DNA at the 5′​side of the dUTP-incorporated templates from previous
LAMP reactions while having no effect on non-dUTP-incorporated DNA and RNA templates. During the
RT-LAMP reaction, the digested contaminants are degraded into small fragments, and UDG is inactivated at
approximately 63 °C, ensuring that only the RNA template is amplified.

independent runs (inter-assay) (Table 4). In both intra- and inter-assay analyses, all of the samples yielded a
positive result, and the proportion of each dilution yielding a positive result was 1.00. All triplicate amplifications
of each dilution resulted in minor differences in Tt values but the standard deviation did not exceed 0.80 for any
replicate. The coefficients of variation for the Tt values determined for each viral RNA concentration varied from
0.22 to 1.08% in the intra-assay analysis and from 1.06 to 3.33% in the inter-assay analysis (Table 4).
rRT-LAMP and UDG-rRT-LAMP detect simulated carryover contamination.  To confirm that
simulated carryover contamination from dUTP-incorporated RT-LAMP amplicons is sufficient to contaminate
new reactions, we compared the detection limits of the rRT-LAMP and UDG-rRT-LAMP methods using serial
diluted rRT-LAMP amplicons with concentrations ranging from 0.5 ×​ 10−19
to 0.5 ×​ 10−14 
g/μ​
L. In the absence
of UDG treatment, rRT-LAMP can detect as little as 1 ×​ 10−18 
g of simulated carryover contamination per reac-
tion (Fig. 4A), which is equivalent to an aerosol droplet diameter size of approximately 0.124 μ​
m. This result
indicated that even at extremely low concentrations or small particle sizes, carryover contamination can cause
false positive results. With UDG treatment, the UDG-rRT-LAMP assay could only detect 1 ×​ 10−15 
g or more
of simulated carryover contamination per reaction (Fig. 4B), equivalent to an aerosol droplet diameter size of
approximately 1.241 μ​
m. These results demonstrated that UDG prevented the amplification of up to 1000-fold
higher concentrations of carryover contaminant DNA and 1000-fold smaller sizes of aerosol droplets generated
by UDG-rRT-LAMP products which significantly reduce the likelihood of false-positive results of TMUV diag-
nosis. A UDG concentration of 0.01 U/μ​
L in the UDG-rRT-LAMP reaction mixture is sufficient to eliminate as
much as 1 ×​ 10−16 
g of dUTP-incorporated carryover contamination per reaction.
UDG-rRT-LAMP can avoid false-positive results.  To confirm that UDG-rRT-LAMP can reduce the
likelihood of false-positive results due to carryover contaminants, we performed sensitivity testing of rRT-LAMP
and UDG-rRT-LAMP reactions with 10-fold serial dilutions of the transcribed NS5 gene and added 1 ×​ 10−18 
g
of simulated carryover contamination to each reaction tube. Without UDG treatment, we could not determine
the detection limit of the assay, and all tested samples displayed positive results (Tt value of 30.8–37.4), includ-
ing samples with undetectable levels of viral RNA (less than 0.5 ×​ 102 
copies/μ​
L) (Fig. 4C). These results were
considered false positive. With UDG treatment, the detection limit of the rRT-LAMP assay (0.5 ×​ 102 
copies/μ​L)
(Fig. 4D) was consistent with the aforementioned sensitivity study. Such results were considered positive. From
these data, the developed UDG-rRT-LAMP assay could successfully eliminate carryover contamination.
UDG-rRT-LAMP detectsTMUV in clinical samples.  To assess whether the developed TMUV UDG-rRT-
LAMP assay allows the detection of viral RNA in clinical samples, a total of 81 samples were analyzed by
UDG-rRT-LAMP and VI combined with NS5 gene-based cRT-PCR. Of these, 62 samples were positive accord-
ing to both UDG-rRT-LAMP and VI, 17 samples were negative according to both assays, 2 samples were

Discussion
TMUV was originally identified as a tropical pathogen in Malaysia during the 1970s, and the main hosts of the
virus were confirmed to be different bird species, which were responsible for the maintenance and transmission
of TMUV in nature34
. Severe diseases with mortality caused by the infection of birds with TMUV were indicated
for the first time in chickens during the 1990s11
and subsequently studied in ducks in the early 2010s1,2
. Our
recent study reported a potential case of human infection with TMUV15
, highlighting the urgent need for effec-
tive TMUV infection control and prevention methods, particularly detection methods. Several studies reported
molecular methods for the detection of TMUV1,11,24–26
. Nevertheless, those PCR-based assays require significant
time, multiple steps, expensive instruments, and well-trained personnel to perform the experiments24
. The use of
LAMP technology is increasing in popularity for detection of TMUV and other viruses27,28
because of its rapid,
simple, sensitive, specific, and isothermal reaction capacity without the need for a specialized thermal cycler. In
this study, we applied an advanced UDG-rRT-LAMP method to the detection of all recognized TMUV-related
viruses.
Unlike RT-PCR or rRT-PCR, which requires one pair of primers or one pair of primers and a probe, RT-LAMP
requires at least four primers that recognize six regions of the target RNA sequence, and thus, its specificity is
extremely high30
. On the contrary, to achieve high specificity, the LAMP primers must have a strict match with
their target sequences, or failure of amplification will occur35
. Thus, to develop a universal TMUV detection
assay, identifying conserved regions in the TMUV genome sequence is a critical step in RT-LAMP primer design.
Recently, Dai et al.36
provided evidence of natural recombination in TMUV and genetic divergence between var-
ious TMUV strains isolated in different years. Therefore, in the present study, we selected the complete ORFs of
13 representative TMUV reference strains from genotyping groups 1 and 2 (including subgroups 1–3) to screen
highly conserved regions among these strains for UDG-rRT-LAMP assay development. Based on the visible
alignment result, we found few regions in the TMUV ORFs that were sufficiently conserved for designing the
LAMP primers for the universal detection of different TMUV strains. A TMUV variant, CQW1 (KM233707),
was identified to be extremely different from other reference strains concerning its E, NS3, and NS5 genes, which
were commonly used in detection assay development in previous studies1,29,37
. Fortunately, we identified a 210-nt
candidate region with relatively high sequence conservation in the 3′​
-terminus of the NS5 gene, which corre-
sponds to the RdRP domain with >​
99% nucleotide identity. The size of this region was sufficient to meet the
requirement of LAMP primer set designing. The highly conserved features of this region distinguished our NS5
RdRP domain-based UDG-rRT-LAMP assay from other published assays.
Although LAMP has been revealed to be a highly sensitive and specific assay in the clinical diagnosis of many
pathogens, it was also found to be highly susceptible to carryover contamination due to its high sensitivity32
. The
LAMP result is commonly confirmed by DNA electrophoresis and direct observation after adding a fluorescent
dye. In these processes, both observation methods require the opening of reaction tubes, easily generating aerosol
droplets of different sizes that contain high concentrations of amplicons38
. Our present study revealed that an
extremely small amount of amplification products (1 ×​ 10−18 
g/reaction) from previous LAMP reactions could
serve as carryover contamination templates for re-amplification, resulting in false-positive results. When convert-
ing the minimum contaminants dose that can cause false-positive results to the size of aerosol droplets, the parti-
cle diameter was found to be extremely small (approximately 0.124 μ​m). This could not be filtered by most routine
processing methods in the laboratory. Importantly, due to the current lack of an effective strategy for eliminating
LAMP carryover contamination, preventing carryover contamination relies solely on careful operation of the
LAMP experiment. Once contamination occurs in the laboratory, the procedure for eliminating or reducing con-
tamination is usually complicated, costly, time-consuming, and sometimes requires moving the experiment to a
new laboratory room or designing a set of primes targeting different genomic regions32
.
Although there were some pre- and post-amplification strategies for preventing or eliminating carryover
contamination in other nucleic acid amplification assays, including mechanical/chemical barriers38
, UV light
irradiation39
, primer hydrolysis40
, and hydroxylamine treatment41
, these methods may not be able to completely
eliminate or prevent carryover contamination. Therefore, they are not ideal approaches for controlling carryover

contamination in LAMP reaction33
. Compared with the aforementioned methods, the UDG-mediated digestion
of dUTP-incorporated contaminant DNA is simple, inexpensive, and does not require substantial modification
of existing protocols42
. It specifically removes dUTP bases in uracil-containing DNA but has no effect on natural
DNA43
and RNA templates44
. The prevention of carryover contamination using dUTP and UDG has been well
documented in previously reported PCR and LAMP assays using both DNA and RNA as the template31–33,45
. For
RNA samples used in UDG-LAMP reactions, reverse transcription, UDG treatment, and the LAMP reaction
are usually performed in separate steps33
, which necessitates opening the reaction tube and increasing the risk
of exposing the reaction mixture to carryover contaminants in the environment. Such a disadvantage limits the
practical application of the UDG-RT-LAMP assay in the clinical detection of RNA viruses. Therefore, we per-
formed rRT-LAMP amplification with UDG digestion in a one-pot reaction to eliminate carryover contaminants
for the first time. The developed UDG-rRT-LAMP assay could remove as much as 1 ×​ 10−16 
g/reaction of simu-
lated contaminants with a UDG concentration of only 0.01 U/μ​
L. Although the simulated contaminants cannot
be removed at high concentrations (1 ×​ 10−15 
g/reaction or more), adding more UDG and physically separating
large aerosol droplet particles could serve as backup methods. To avoid opening the reaction tube during result
detection, EvaGreen®fluorescent dye was integrated into the RT-LAMP reaction for quantitative monitoring of
the amplification and observing the endpoint result visually. Moreover, Bst 2.0 warmStart®DNA polymerase
was used in our strategy to enhance dUTP incorporation, amplification speed, amplicon yield, salt tolerance,
thermostability, and specificity in the assay, which are critical to the success of the UDG-rRT-LAMP assay for
TMUV detection.
In conclusion, based on the complete ORF alignment of various TMUV strains from different genotyping
groups, we developed a universal TMUV detection assay using rRT-LAMP combined with UDG treatment to
prevent/eliminate carryover contamination. This UDG-rRT-LAMP method is a rapid, sensitive, specific, and
reliable assay for diagnosing TMUV infection, and it provides a potentially powerful strategy for avoiding
false-positive results in detecting other flaviviruses.
Materials and Methods
Ethics statement.  Viral propagation and testing were performed according to the approved the Institutional
Biosafety Committee, Shandong Agricultural University. All tissue samples analyzed in this study were collected
for diagnostic purposes and approved by Animal Welfare Committee, Shandong Agricultural University (License
number: 2015-Vet-012).The animal care and research were conducted according to Guide for the Care and Use
of Laboratory Animals, National Research Council, 2011 (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/Guide-for-the-Care-
and-use-of-laboratory-animals.pdf).
Primer design.  To identify the most conserved region among 10 genes from different TMUV strains, 13
complete ORFs of TMUV strains (isolated from 2010 to 2014) were used in this study, including 11 duck, 1
layer, and 1 goose strain. These strains represent all different TMUV genotyping groups/subgroups described in a
recent TMUV evolutionary analysis study36
. The alignment of complete ORFs was conducted using the mVISTA
online program (http://genome.lbl.gov/vista/mvista/submit.shtml) and the pairwise comparison of the selected
conserved region was performed using the ClustalW method in Genomic Workbench V7.5 software (QIAGEN,
Boston, MA, USA). Since the most highly conserved regions were located at the 3′​end of the NS5 gene among
different TMUV strains, the last 210 bp of the NS5 gene were chosen as the optimal target region for RT-LAMP
primer sequence basis. Primers were designed and optimized for sequence conservation using an online pro-
gram (PrimerExplorer V4, http://primerexplorer.jp/elamp4.0.0/index.html). The designed primer set contains
four primers: F3, Forward Inner Primer (FIP), Backward Inner Primer (BIP), and B3. FIP (BIP) consists of the
sequence of the F1c (B1c) and F2 (B2) regions. The specificity of the primers was further confirmed using a
BLAST search in the NCBI nucleotide database.
Virus strains, cell lines, and RNA extraction.  For the UDG-rRT-LAMP evaluation test, six TUMV field
variant strains isolated from ducks, ducklings, geese, house sparrows, and mosquitoes in Shandong Province
were propagated in a African green monkey kidney cell line (Vero) (CCL-81, ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA), and
titrated in tissue culture infectious doses (TCID50). AIV-H5N1, AIV-H9N2, NDV, ARV, DuCV, DHAV were
also included in this study for specificity testing. Viral RNA was directly extracted from a 20% suspension (w/v)
of viral transport medium diluted clinical samples, cell culture supernatant, and allantoic fluid using an RNeasy
Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 250 μ​
L of sample
was mixed with same volume of lysis buffer and then applied to the RNA binding column. After three washes,
the contaminants were efficiently washed away, and total RNA eluted in 50 μ​
L of RNase-free water was used for
further testing.
In vitro transcription of the partial NS5 gene.  The in vitro-transcribed NS5 RdRP domain RNA of a
TMUV field strain isolated from Peking duck (TMUV-SD2010)4
was used to determine the detection limit of
the assay. The NS5 RdRP domain (1084 bp) of TMUV-SD2010 was amplified using published procedures46
and
cloned into the pGEM-T easy Vector system (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) as described in our previous study4
.
The recombinant plasmid pGEM-NS5 was linearized by EcoRI (Promega), extracted using phenol–chloroform–
isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), precipitated using ethanol, and suspended in water before using the DNA for in vitro
transcription reactions. The production of “run-off” transcripts derived from the inserted M1 segment used the
Riboprobe®in vitro Transcription System with T7 RNA Polymerase (Promega) following the manufacturer’s
instructions. The transcribed RNA concentration was quantitated using a NanoDrop™​1000 spectrophotometer
(Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and copy numbers were calculated as previously described47
before
making a 10-fold serial dilution for sensitivity testing and generating the standard curve.

UDG-rRT-LAMP conditions.  The UDG-rRT-LAMP for the NS5 RdRP domain was conducted in a 20-μ​L
reaction system. The total reaction master mix volume was 18 μ​
L consisting of 1.6 μ​
M each of FIP and BIP
primers, 0.2 μ​
M each of F3 and B3 primers, 1.6 mM dNTPs (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA), 1 M betaine
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), 4 mM MgSO4 (New England Biolabs, MA, USA), 5 U of AMV reverse tran-
scriptase (Promega), 100 mM dUTP (New England Biolabs), 0.2 U UDG (New England Biolabs), 1×​ ThermoPol
reaction buffer, 8 U of Bst 2.0 warmStart®DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs), and 1×​ EvaGreen®fluores-
cent dye (Biotium, Hayward, CA, USA). After adding 2 μ​
L of viral RNA, the reaction mixture was incubated at
room temperature for 5 min to eliminate carryover contamination. Following incubation, the reaction was per-
formed using the 7500 Real-time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) for rRT-LAMP or with
a water bath for RT-LAMP at 63 °C for 1 h. The thermal cycling profile for rRT-LAMP proceeded as follows: 60
cycles of 62.5 °C for 5 s and 63.5 °C for 55 s. Fluorescence signals for each sample were collected at the end of the
63.5 °C step. The time threshold (Tt) values and standard curve were analyzed using the SDS software program
(version 1.4) and visualized using OriginPro 8.5 software (OriginLab, Northampton, MA, USA). The rRT-LAMP
results were also detected by fluorescence observation under UV light and 2% (w/v) agarose gel electrophoresis.
Sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility of UDG-rRT-LAMP.  The sensitivity of the UDG-rRT-
LAMP assay was determined in two separate systems. One system was transcribed NS5 RdRP domain RNA of the
TMUV-SD2010 strain, which was diluted from 0.5 ×​ 107
to 0.5 ×​ 100 
copies/μ​
L. The other system was extracted
RNA from 10-fold serial dilutions of titrated TMUV field variant strains isolated from different hosts in Shandong
province. Three replicates for each dilution of different samples were tested using the developed UDG-rRT-LAMP
assay. The detection limit of the assay was determined as the last dilution at which all three replicates from each
dilution gave a positive result. Samples of serial dilutions of six TUMV field variant strains were also tested by NS5
gene-based cRT-PCR46
to compare its sensitivity with that of UDG-rRT-LAMP.
The specificity of UDG-rRT-LAMP was first examined using viral RNA from different avian pathogens of
AIV-H5N1, AIV-H9N2, NDV, ARV, DuCV, and DHAV to confirm that no cross-reactions with non-targeted
viral RNA occurred. The allantoic fluid from SPF duck embryos was also included in the test as a negative control.
To further confirm the developed assay have no cross-reactions with non-TMUV flaviviruses, the last 1500 bp
NS5 gene sequences of BAGV (GenBank accession no. EU684972), ITV (GenBank accession no. KC734549),
JEV (GenBank accession no. AF080251), WNV (GenBank accession no. AY532665), TBEV (GenBank acces-
sion no. FJ402886) and YFV (GenBank accession no. U54798) were synthesized and cloned into pUC57 vector
(Genscript, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China) for specificity test purpose and the empty pUC57 vector was working as a
negative control.
The reproducibility of the developed assay was assessed using transcribed NS5 RdRP domain RNA from
the TMUV-SD2010 strain. The RNA was diluted from 0.5 ×​ 107
to 0.5 ×​ 102 
copies/μ​
L to prepare the intra- and
inter-assay samples. Replicate samples of each dilution were stored at −​
80 °C immediately after preparation. For
the intra-assay test, three replicate samples from each dilution were tested in the same run. For the inter-assay test,
samples from different dilutions were tested in three independent runs. Reproducibility was measured by calcu-
lating the proportion of positive samples and determining Tt values of each sample. The coefficient of variation
was determined to find statistical correlations.
Simulating carryover contamination.  The amplicons of the RT-LAMP reaction generated from
0.5 ×​ 104 
copies/μ​
L of transcribed NS5 RdRP domain RNA of the TMUV-SD2010 strain in the absence of UDG,
which served as the source of simulating carryover contaminants, was quantitated using the NanoDrop™​1000
spectrophotometer to generate a 10-fold serial dilution from 0.5 ×​ 10−14
to 0.5 ×​ 10−19 
g/μ​L. When using 0.2 μ​L of
diluted RT-LAMP amplicons as the template in the UDG-rRT-LAMP assay, the total mass of carryover contami-
nants was approximately 1 ×​ 10−19
 −​ 1 ×​ 10−14
 g/reaction (equivalent to aerosol droplet diameter size of 2.673 μ​m,
1.241 μ​m, 0.567 μ​m, 0.267 μ​m, 0.124 μ​
m and 0.057 μ​m, respectively).
Elimination of carryover contamination byUDG-rRT-LAMP.  To evaluate the ability of the developed
UDG-rRT-LAMP method to reduce false-positive results due to carryover contaminants in detecting TMUV,
we conducted both rRT-LAMP and UDG-rRT-LAMP reactions by adding 2 μ​
L of diluted viral RNA templates
(0.5 ×​ 10−1
 −​ 0.5 ×​ 104 
copies/μ​
L) and 2 μ​
L of simulated carryover contamination of 0.5 ×​ 10−18 
g/μ​
L in the same
reaction tube. The total mass of the simulated carryover contamination for each reaction was approximately
equivalent to a 0.124 μ​
m-diameter aerosol droplet, which cannot be efficiently blocked by either high efficiency
particulate air (HEPA) filters48
in the biosafety cabinets or fibrous pipette tip filters49
. The detection limits of the
rRT-LAMP reactions with and without UDG treatment before amplification were compared to confirm whether
the studied UDG-rRT-LAMP assay can eliminate false positives.
UDG-rRT-LAMP detectTMUV in clinical sample.  Eighty-one original tissue specimens, including theca
folliculi, oviduct, heart, and liver from ducks or other avian species that exhibited clinical signs and lesions con-
sistent with those of TMUV infections during necropsies, were used to evaluate UDG-rRT-LAMP in detection
TMUV from clinical poultry specimens. The collected tissue samples were minced using scissors in viral trans-
port medium50
to produce a 20% suspension (w/v). The tissue suspension was further processed in a stomacher
blender (Model 80, Seward Ltd., Davie, FL, USA) and centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Thereafter,
the processing tissue supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-nm syringe filter for UDG-rRT-LAMP detection
and virus isolation (VI) in Vero cells. TMUV-positive isolates were confirmed by NS5 gene-based cRT-PCR46
to
detect TMUV-infected cytopathic effect cells from the specimen-inoculated Vero cell cultures. Lastly, the agree-
ment between UDG-rRT-LAMP and VI results was summarized to investigate the clinical performance of our
