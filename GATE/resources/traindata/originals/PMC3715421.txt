Abstract
The wetlands of the Brazilian Pantanal host large concentrations of diverse wildlife species and hematophagous arthropods,
conditions that favor the circulation of zoonotic arboviruses. A recent study from the Nhecolândia sub-region of Pantanal
reported serological evidence of various flaviviruses, including West Nile virus and Ilheus virus (ILHV). According to the age
of seropositive horses, at least three flaviviruses, including ILHV, circulated in the Brazilian Pantanal between 2005 and 2009.
To extend this study, we collected 3,234 adult mosquitoes of 16 species during 2009 and 2010 in the same sub-region.
Mosquito pool homogenates were assayed for infectious virus on C6/36 and Vero cell monolayers and also tested for
flaviviral RNA by a group-specific real-time RT-PCR. One pool containing 50 non-engorged female specimens of Aedes
scapularis tested positive for ILHV by culture and for ILHV RNA by real-time RT-PCR, indicating a minimum infection rate of
2.5 per 1000. Full-length genomic sequence exhibited 95% identity to the only full genome sequence available for ILHV. The
present data confirm the circulation of ILHV in the Brazilian Pantanal.

Introduction
Ilheus virus (ILHV) was first described in 1944, when it was
isolated from Aedes and Psorophora spp. mosquitoes during an
epidemiological investigation of yellow fever in the city of Ilhéus,
state of Bahia, northeast Brazil [1], [2]. According to the Ninth
Report of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses,
ILHV is included in the Ntaya virus group [3]. ILHV causes
mainly asymptomatic infections in humans with rare reports of
encephalitis throughout northern South America [4], [5]. Human
infection with ILHV has been reported in Trinidad, Panama,
Colombia, French Guyana, Brazil, Ecuador and Bolivia [6], [7],
[8], [9], [10], [11], [12].
ILHV is believed to be maintained in zoonotic cycles between
birds and mosquitoes and has been isolated in Central and South
America primarily from mosquitoes [13], [14], [15], [16]. ILHV
has been previously isolated from eight mosquito genera, but also
from sentinel monkeys, man and birds. In antibody surveys,
neutralizing antibodies for ILHV have been found in rodents,
birds, sentinel monkeys and man [17]. In the 1990s, ILHV was
isolated from wild birds in southeast Brazil [18].
Little is known about ILHV infections in domestic animals. In the
1990s, a serological investigation conducted among equines from the
Pantanal region of west-central Brazil found neutralizing antibodies
to ILHV suggesting its circulation in the region [19]. In 2009, a
flavivirus serosurvey conducted in the same area among equines
from the Nhecolândia sub-region of the Pantanal detected evidence
of past infection with, in increasing order of seroprevalence,
Cacipacore virus (CPCV), West Nile virus (WNV), Saint Louis
encephalitis virus (SLEV) and ILHV [20].
The Brazilian Pantanal is a seasonally flooded surface of
approximately 140,000 km2
. The area is divided into 11 sub-
regions based on characteristics of seasonal floods, physiography
and ecology. Nhecolândia is the second largest of these sub-regions
with approximately 27,000 km2
and the world’s largest and most
diverse area of subtropical lakes encompassing approximately
10,000 lakes [21], [22], and a human population of less than
22,500 in 2010 [23].
The wetlands of the Brazilian Pantanal host large concentra-
tions of diverse wildlife species and hematophagous arthropods,
conditions that favor the circulation of zoonotic arboviruses. In
spite of scarce data concerning arbovirus vectors in the area, the
local movement of mosquito species previously reported as
arbovirus vectors has been reported in the north and south of
Pantanal [24], [25].
Serological surveys conducted in local horses have found
neutralizing antibodies for at least eight arboviruses, including
the bunyaviruses Tacaiuma virus and Maguari virus, the
alphaviruses eastern equine encephalitis virus and western equine
encephalitis virus and the flaviviruses CPCV, SLEV, WNV and
ILHV [19], [20], [26], [27].
Despite the recent detection of neutralizing antibodies to
various flaviviruses in horses from the Nhecolândia sub-region,
circulation of these arboviruses in this area was never confirmed
by virus isolation. Therefore, in an effort to detect flaviviruses
currently being transmitted in this region, we collected and tested

adult female mosquitoes for infectious virus and for flavivirus RNA
detection.
Materials and Methods
Study area
In October 2009, April and October 2010, attempts to collect
adult mosquitoes were undertaken at sites randomly selected
within eight beef cattle ranches comprising a large area of
approximately 1,500 km2
in the Nhecolândia sub-region of
Pantanal, west-central Brazil (18u189–19u159S, 57u059–55u249W)
(Figure 1). The collections for this study were authorized by the
owners or residents of the sampled properties and also by the
Animal Ethics Committee of Fundação Oswaldo Cruz (License
CEUA-Fiocruz LW-1/12, protocol P-74/10-5) and the Brazilian
Institute of Environment and Natural Resources (licenses IBAMA
18363-1/2009 and 18363-2/2010).
Mosquito collections
A total of 50 attempts to collect adult mosquitoes were
undertaken, but only 39 were positive for mosquitoes. From 11
unsuccessful attempts, five were undertaken in October 2009 and
six in October 2010, during the local dry season. Among the 39
positive collections, 12 were undertaken in October 2009, 15 in
April 2010 and 12 in October 2010. Seventeen collections were
Author Summary
Ilheus virus causes mainly asymptomatic infections in
humans with rare reports of encephalitis in northern South
America. Ilheus virus is believed to be maintained in
zoonotic cycles between birds and mosquitoes in Central
and South America. Aiming to detect Ilheus virus and
other arboviruses in the Pantanal region of west-central
Brazil, host-seeking mosquitoes were collected by aspira-
tion as they landed on horses, research team members,
and caimans. Resting mosquitoes were collected from the
walls inside a local residence and additional flying
mosquitoes were captured in light traps. We isolated a
Brazilian strain of Ilheus virus from a pool of 50 Aedes
scapularis mosquitoes that were collected while landing
on a member of our research team, in April, 2010. Our
finding confirms a recent report of Ilheus virus activity in
the Pantanal derived from the detection of neutralizing
antibodies in horses. The anthropophilic behavior of the
infected mosquito(es) suggests a risk of Ilheus virus
transmission from mosquitoes to humans in the region.
We provide the virus’ complete genomic sequence and
present its phylogenetic relationship with other isolates.

Ilheus Virus in the Pantanal, Brazil
PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | www.plosntds.org 3 July 2013 | Volume 7 | Issue 7 | e2318
conducted using CDC light traps, six collections using manual
aspirators from horses, ten on research team members, three on
caimans and three using manual aspirators while landing on walls
inside a local residence. Mosquitoes were transported alive to a
field laboratory where they were immobilized by cold anesthesia
and were identified by species based on morphologic appearance
according to taxonomic keys [28], [29]. The mosquitoes were
grouped into pools of up to 50 individuals that were sorted with
respect to collection method, site of capture, species and gender
and then stored in liquid nitrogen.
Virus isolation
Mosquito samples were assayed for viral cytopathic effect (CPE)
on C6/36 and plaque formation on Vero cell cultures using
standard protocols [30]. Briefly, pools from one up to 50 mosquito
specimens were placed in polypropylene capped 2 mL tubes with
copper-clad steel beads and 1 mL of BA-1 diluent (16 Medium
199-H, 0.05 M TRIS-HCI, 1% Bovine serum albumin, 4 mM L-
Glutamine, 0.35 g/L Sodium bicarbonate, 200 U/mL Penicillin,
200 mg/mL Streptomycin, 2 mg/mL Amphotericin B and 50 mg/
mL Gentamycin). A 0.1 mL aliquot of each triturated mosquito
pool was inoculated in duplicate onto C6/36 and Vero
monolayers prepared in 6-well polystyrene culture plates. The
plates were maintained at 28uC and 37uC, respectively, for 1 h
with discrete motion every 15 min to optimize virus adsorption. At
the end of this period, 3 mL of maintenance media (16 DMEM,
Sterile water, 2% Fetal bovine serum, 7.5% Sodium bicarbonate,
1 M HEPES, Non-essentials amino acids, Sodium pyruvate,
200 U/mL Penicillin, 200 mg/mL Streptomycin, 2 mg/mL Am-
photericin B and 50 mg/mL Gentamycin) were added to the C6/
36 cultures and 3 mL of 0.5% agarose in overlay media with 26
Ye-Lah overlay medium (106 Earle’s BBS, Ye-Lah medium, 2%
Fetal bovine serum and Sterile distilled water), 7.5% Sodium
bicarbonate, 200 U/mL Penicillin, 200 mg/mL Streptomycin,

observed daily for viral CPE. Plates with Vero monolayers were
divided in two groups and then incubated at 37uC at 5% CO2.

agarose culture media. Both groups were kept at 37uC in 5% CO2
for 10 days, and observed daily for viral plaques.
Real-time RT-PCR
A Sybr green real-time RT-PCR method for the universal
detection of flaviviruses was performed to test all mosquito samples
for flaviviral nucleic acid. First, RNA was extracted from triturated
mosquitoes, and then tested for flavivirus genus-specific viral RNA
by real-time RT-PCR using the QiaAmp viral RNA kit (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA, USA). The protocol chosen is based on the
amplification of a 269–272 nucleotide region at the N terminus of
the NS5 gene [31]. Amplicons of samples that presented a melting
curve peak above 90 RFU at a temperature above 75uC were
considered positive and selected for purification and cDNA
sequencing using both forward and reverse primers in separate
reactions. DNA amplifications and sequencing reactions were
completed on a DNA Engine PTC-200 thermal cycler (Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) and analyzed on an ABI 3130
genetic analyzer (Applied Byosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).
Sequences were assembled using Lasergene 9 software (DNA
STAR, Madison, WI, USA) and subjected to a BLASTn analysis.
Full genome sequencing and phylogenetics
Amplification of total RNA was performed utilizing the
SuperScript III one-step RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA) and universal NS5 specific flavivirus primers (cFD3 and
FU1) [32]. An initial fragment of approximately 1,000 base pairs
was generated and subjected to GenBank BLAST analysis for
identification. Once initial sequencing of the NS5 region indicated
high identity with ILHV, primers for full-length sequencing were
designed utilizing Primer 3 software in Geneious R6 based on the
full-length ILHV sequence in GenBank (NC_009028). Fragments
were extracted from an agarose gel with the Qiagen Qiaquick kit
and subjected to nucleotide sequencing using BigDye Terminator
V3.1 Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA,
USA) on a DNA Engine PTC-200 thermal cycler (Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). The products were purified
using BigDye Xterminator product (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA, USA) and then subjected to an ABI 3130 Genetic
Analyzer (Applied Byosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Sequenc-
ing files were aligned and analyzed utilizing Geneious R6 software.
The full-length sequence was aligned with homologous flavivirus
genomes utilizing MAFFT v7.017 [33], and trees analyzing the full
genome sequence as well as the individual NS5 and E genes were
generated using maximum-likelihood analyses with a PhyML
algorithm in SeaView 4.0 [34] with 1,000 bootstrap replicates.
Genome sequences of all flaviviruses sequences utilized are listed

Results
A total of 3,234 mosquitoes of at least 16 species were collected
from five out of the eight ranches where mosquito collection
attempts were undertaken (Table 1). Mosquitoes of at least 11
species were identified from human landing collections, 11 from
equine landing collections, 11 from CDC light traps, four from
caimans and only one indoor.
Among the 1,297 specimens caught landing on horses, the most
common species was Mansonia pseudotitillans (n = 177; 13,6%).
Interestingly, all the specimens were only collected in October
2010, indicating a marked fluctuation of this species in the region.
On the other hand, among all different methods of capture used,
Uranotaenia lowii, Cx. coronator, Cx. declarator, Cx. chidesteri and Ma.
humeralis were only detected in the April collections.
Among the mosquitoes identified to species, Ae. scapularis was the
most prevalent with 460 (14.2%) specimens of all mosquitoes
captured. Most were caught while attempting to acquire blood
from humans (n = 294; 64%) and horses (n = 87; 18.7%) while only
54 (11.7%) were captured on caimans, 26 (5.7%) in CDC light
traps, and none indoors, indicating anthropophilic behavior with
no evidence for endophily. Ae. scapularis was the most abundant
species identified in October 2009 and in April 2010, whereas Cx.
quinquefasciatus was the most prevalent species among mosquitoes
collected in October, 2010.
Ae. scapularis tested positive for ILHV by culture and for ILHV
RNA by real-time RT-PCR, indicating a minimum infection rate
of 2.5 per 1,000. Among the 331 specimens of Cx. quinquefasciatus
collected in October 2010, 215 (64.9%) were removed from the
walls of a local residence, 115 (34.7%) were obtained using CDC
light traps and only one (0.3%) specimen was caught while blood-
feeding on a horse, confirming its endophilic behavior.
A total of 292 mosquito pools were assayed by cell culture and
real-time RT-PCR. One pool of 50 non-engorged female Ae.
scapularis demonstrated plaques on Vero cells and CPE in C6/36
cells on the 3rd
and 6th
day post-inoculation, respectively. A 1,034-
bp cDNA amplicon was obtained, and identified as closely related
to ILHV. The NCBI file with the highest identity was the Ilheus
virus isolate PE163615 (GenBank: EF396950.1) and had an e-
value of 0.0, a maximum score of 1688, coverage of 95%, and a
maximum identity of 98%.The complete genome (10,759-bp) was
sequenced and the alignment with the only full-length genome
available in GenBank revealed a 95% similarity to the original
strain of ILHV, isolated in Brazil in 1944 (NCBI Reference
Sequence: NC_009028) (Figure 2). Phylogenetic analysis grouped
the NS5 and Envelope sequences of our isolate with Ilheus virus
isolate FSE800 (GenBank: EF396947.1) (Figure 3) isolated from a
human case in Ecuador [11]. A total of 44 nonsynonymous amino
acid changes were identified between our isolate and the GenBank
Ilheus 1944 isolate. Three nucleotide inserts were identified in the
capsid region creating an amino acid shift between amino acid
residue number 24 and 37 (nucleotides 166–204) (Figure 4;
Table 2). The genome sequence of our isolate of ILHV designated
as BrMS-MQ10 was deposited in the publicly accessible database
GenBank under accession number KC481679. This strain was
isolated from mosquitoes landing on research team members on
April 18th
, 2010 from 5:35 to 7:00 pm in a natural drying lake near
an artificial reservoir. Several additional viruses were detected by
mosquito cell culture and/or real-time RT-PCR that did not align
with known sequences on GenBank. These viruses will be
described separately.
Discussion
In the present work we confirm ILHV activity in the
Nhecolândia sub-region of Pantanal, through the isolation of
ILHV from a pool of Ae. scapularis, which was the most prevalent
mosquito species identified, and one that has transmitted ILHV
efficiently in laboratory vector competence studies [35]. The
anthropophilic behavior, relatively high prevalence, and suscep-
tibility to infection (minimum infection rate observed 2.5 per
1,000) implicate Ae. scapularis as a suspect vector of medical
importance for ILHV in the Brazilian Pantanal. This species is
known for its gonotrophic discordance, a trait that amplifies its
importance as a vector [36].
The isolated strain, BrMS-MQ10 had 44 nonsynonymous
mutations identified as compared to the only other ILHV full
genome sequence available in GenBank. Interestingly, there were
three individual nucleotide insertions identified between codon 24
and 37 of the capsid region. The capsid protein is known to form
secondary structures that likely indicate the protein interacts with
itself during nucleocapsid assembly [37]. Similarly, capsid has
been implicating with modulating cellular pathways as well as
plays a role in cis-acting interactions with other regions of the viral
genome [38], [39]. Being only the isolate of ILHV with a full
genome sequence record, the importance of these changes in the
capsid region are as yet undefined. Future studies should strive to
characterize the differences between the two known isolates and
determine the significance of insertions in that region of the capsid.
Much remains undiscovered regarding mosquito populations in
the Pantanal region. Four mosquito species, including Ma.
pseudotitillans, Anopheles argyritarsis, Cx. coronator and Ur. lowii, are
herein reported for the first time in the Nhecolândia sub-region.
The abundance of several mosquito species differed greatly
compared with a study conducted in the same region in 2007
[25]. This marked fluctuation of local mosquito populations was
probably due to variations in annual rainfall and may influence
arbovirus transmission dynamics in the region.
Little is known about human health conditions in the Brazilian
Pantanal [40]. The previously reported high prevalence of
neutralizing antibodies for ILHV in horses [20] combined with
our isolation of ILHV in local mosquitoes confirm the activity of
an arbovirus of potential medical importance in the region. The
isolation of ILHV infection in mosquitoes while attempting to
blood feed on a human warrants further investigation of this virus
by the Brazilian arbovirus surveillance program and local
physicians.
