   A generic two-step lyssavirus real-time reverse transcriptase
   polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), based on a nested PCR strategy,
   was validated for the detection of different lyssavirus species.
   Primers with 17 to 30% of degenerate bases were used in both
   consecutive steps. The assay could accurately detect RABV, LBV, MOKV,
   DUVV, EBLV-1, EBLV-2, and ABLV. In silico sequence alignment showed a
   functional match with the remaining lyssavirus species.The diagnostic
   specificity was 100% and the sensitivity proved to be superior to that
   of the fluorescent antigen test. The limit of detection was ‚â§1 50%
   tissue culture infectious dose. The related vesicular stomatitis virus
   was not recognized, confirming the selectivity for lyssaviruses. The
   assay was applied to follow the evolution of rabies virus infection in
   the brain of mice from 0 to 10 days after intranasal inoculation. The
   obtained RNA curve corresponded well with the curves obtained by a
   one-step monospecific RABV-qRT-PCR, the fluorescent antigen test, and
   virus titration. Despite the presence of degenerate bases, the assay
   proved to be highly sensitive, specific, and reproducible.

   1. Introduction

   Rabies is a fatal viral encephalitis that results from infection with
   negative strand RNA-viruses belonging to the genus Lyssavirus, family
   Rhabdoviridae, orderMononegavirales. So far, 12 species have been
   classified in the genusLyssavirus. Tra- ditionally, these include
   Rabies virus (RABV), Lagos bat virus (LBV), Mokola virus (MOKV),
   Duvenhage virus (DUVV), European bat lyssaviruses-1 and -2 (EBLV-1 and
   EBLV- 2), and Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV). More recently, Aravan
   virus (ARAV), Khujand virus (KHUV) [1], Irkut virus (IRKV) [1], Shimoni
   bat virus (SHIBV), and West Caucasian bat virus (WCBV) [1] were also
   added. Ikoma virus (IKOV) [2] and Bokeloh bat lyssavirus (BBLV) [3, 4]
   await classification in the genus.The genus is subdivided into
   phylogroups 1 and 2 [5, 6]. Phylogroup 1 includes RABV, DUVV, EBLV-1,
   EBLV-2, ABLV, ARAV, KHUV, and IRKV.

   Phylogroup 2 includes LBV, MOKV, and SHIBV. WCBV and IKOV do not
   cross-react serologically with any of the two phylogroups.

   The classic rabies virus (RABV) has a worldwide distribu- tion and uses
   carnivores and bats asmain reservoir.The other lyssavirus species are
   mainly maintained in bats and have a more restricted distribution:
   DUVV, LBV, MOKV, SHIBV, and IKOV have been detected exclusively in
   Africa, EBLV- 1, -2 and BBLV in Europe, ABLV in Australia, and ARAV,
   KHUV, IRKV, and WCBV in Asia. It is assumed that most lyssaviruses can
   cause the rabies syndrome in humans and other mammals [6‚Äì8]. In Western
   Europe, most cases of rabies in humans or pets are imported and may be
   caused by any species within the Genus Lyssavirus [9, 10]. For example,
   in 2007, in The Netherlands, a patient died from infection with the
   rare DUVV upon return from Kenya [11]. Moreover, locally acquired
   infections in humans and cats with EBLV-1

   or EBLV-2 are also possible on the European territory [12]. A
   diagnostic assay that can rapidly detect all species is therefore
   highly recommended.

   Currently, the gold standard methods for the diagnosis of rabies
   recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO) are the fluorescent
   antibody test (FAT), the rabies tissue culture infection test (RTCIT),
   and the mouse inocula- tion test (MIT) [13‚Äì18].TheFAT is convenient for
   postmortem examination and detects the presence of viral nucleocapsid
   antigens in the brain or spinal cord tissue by staining with specific
   fluorescent antibodies [14]. For antemortemdiagnosis of rabies, the
   presence of viral antigen can be detected with the FAT in tissue
   sections of skin biopsies, typically in the nerve endings surrounding
   the hair follicles. The viral antigens are however often only
   detectable at the end of the disease or cannot be detected at all by
   this method [17]. Repeated sampling is necessary to improve the
   diagnostic sensitivity.This is not practical for skin biopsies [17] but
   easier for body fluids, such as saliva, urine, or cerebrospinal fluid.
   The sensitivity of the FAT method is considered high for RABV but may
   be lower for other lyssavirus species [19‚Äì21].

   RTCIT and MIT are based on the isolation and propa- gation of virus,
   respectively, in cell culture or in mice [22]. Isolation of the virus
   from body fluids requires the presence of infectious virus in the
   sample and the absence of viral inhibitors or antibodies and is time
   consuming. Antirabies virus antibodies acquired either by natural
   seroconversion, by treatment with immunoglobulins, or after a
   postexposure vaccination can interfere with the virus isolation from
   clinical samples, possibly yielding false negative results in the RTCIT
   andMIT. In our experience,MIT andRTCIT are very specific methods but
   are restricted to samples containing live and uninhibited virus.
   Furthermore, neither the FAT, RTCIT, or MIT can directly distinguish
   between different lyssavirus species. Seroconversion during the course
   of disease is highly indicative for rabies, but patients often receive
   treatment with antirabies immunoglobulins and vaccine, compromis- ing
   the interpretation of serology. Molecular techniques have recently been
   developed for rabies virus diagnosis. Viral RNA

   can be extracted from several matrices, such as saliva, urine,
   cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or skin tissue, and do not require the
   presence of live virus. RT-PCR can therefore be used under a broad
   range of conditions. RT-PCR has been shown to detect RNA in decomposed
   samples [23] or after long-term storage [24], giving a better chance of
   successful diagnosis than RTCIT [25]. Also, the qRT-PCR method can
   allow to distinguish different lyssavirus species.

   Here, we aimed to develop and validate a nested two-step generic
   lyssavirus real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) protocol, combining the use of
   degenerate primers with real-time PCR detection. A two-step approach
   was chosen to maximize the sensitivity of the assay. Degenerate bases
   were included in the primers at key positions to account for the
   variability in the sequence of the different lyssavirus species. During
   the first amplification round (PCR1), the primers amplified a 343 bp
   fragment of the nucleoprotein N gene, whereas in the following
   real-time PCR a 158 bp fragment was amplified and detected using SYBR
   Green. The overall sensitivity, specificity, selectivity, and
   reproducibility of the assay were assessed by comparisonwith FAT.More
   specifically for RABV detection, the performance of the generic
   lyssavirus qRT- PCRwas comparedwith a RABV-specific qRT-PCR protocol,
   using specific primers without degenerate bases. A large set of samples
   obtained fromhumans, naturally and experimentally infected wild and
   domestic animals were included to validate the assay.

   reference laboratory of rabies (ANSES, Nancy, France) between 2009 and
   2013. Samples were reconstituted in 1mL sterile, nuclease-free, and

   [27]. 3Bourhy et al., 1992 [28].

   Vesiculovirus) was also tested to demonstrate the selectivity of the
   primers. VSV belongs to another genus within the family Rhabdoviridae
   and shares biological and genetic featureswith the lyssaviruses.

   2.1.2. Positive Samples. To test the performance of the generic
   lyssavirus qRT-PCR, samples spiked with different lyssaviruses were
   used (Table 2). Challenge Virus Standard- 11 (CVS-11), a virulent
   neurotropic lyssavirus, was obtained from the American Type Culture
   Collection (ATCC: refer- ence VR959). CVS-11 was grown in baby hamster
   kidney (BHK)-21 cells, as described previously [29].

   Experimentally infected brain samples were prepared as described next.
   Female Swiss outbred mice (Harlan, The Netherlands) were inoculated
   intranasally at the age of 6 to 8 weeks, according to Rosseels et al.
   [29]. The experimental procedure was approved by the Local Ethical
   Committee of the WIV-ISP (advice nr. 060217-03). Sixty mice were each
   inoculatedwith 3√ó102 50%TCID

   50 ofCVS-11 and euthanized

   by cervical dislocation from 0 to 10 days after inoculation (DPI). Five
   control mice received only phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The
   evolution of the load of infectious virus, viral antigen, and viral RNA
   was followed for 10 days. The brain was cut in half and the inner part
   of the left half

   4 BioMed Research International

   was pressed on a glass slide for FAT analysis. Both brain halves were
   then homogenized in 1mL of PBS with a Potter homogenator. The
   homogenate underwent 3 consecutive freeze-thaw cycles at ‚àí80‚àòC and was
   centrifuged at 20000 g for 20min at 4‚àòC. The supernatant was collected
   for virus titration (300 Ì†µÌºáL), RABV-specific qRT-PCR, and generic
   lyssavirus qRT-PCR (2√ó85 Ì†µÌºáL).Virus titrationwas performed according to
   the instructions of the Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for
   Terrestrial Animals (Office Interna- tional des Epizooties, 2013).
   Serial five-fold dilutions were added in triplicate to BHK-21 cells.
   After a 2-day incubation period, the cells were stained with
   fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-coupled antinucleocapsid rabbit
   antibodies (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, USA) and the number of
   infected foci was counted. The titre of infectious virus was expressed
   in TCID

   50 /mL.

   2.2. Fluorescent Antibody Test (FAT). TheFATwas performed according to
   the instructions of the Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for
   Terrestrial Animals (Office Interna- tional des Epizooties, 2012).
   Briefly, the tissue slides were fixed in 75% acetone for 10min at ‚àí20‚àòC
   and stained with FITC-labelled antinucleocapsid rabbit antibodies
   (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, USA) for 30min at 37‚àòC. The slides
   were examined with a Nikon Diaphot 200 fluorescence microscope
   connected to a Moticam 2500 camera (Hong- Kong, China) at a
   magnification of 100x.

   2.3. Generic Lyssavirus qRT-PCR

   2.3.1. RNA Extraction. Total RNA from the various samples was extracted
   using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit (for brain and cell culture medium) or
   the Qiagen QIAamp viral RNA Mini kit (for serum and CSF) (Qiagen,
   Hilden, Germany). Brain samples (400mg) were first homogenised in 1mL
   of PBS with a Potter homogenator. Eighty-five microliter of the brain
   homogenate was mixed with 265Ì†µÌºáL of lysis buffer (RLT) and used for RNA
   extraction. From here on, the instructions from the RNeasy Mini kit
   were followed. For RNA extractions from infected cell culture
   supernatants, a volumeof 150Ì†µÌºáLwas homogenised in 200Ì†µÌºáLofRLTbuffer, as
   startingmaterial for the RNA extraction. Starting from serum or CSF, a
   volume of 140 Ì†µÌºáL was used for RNA extraction with the Qiagen QIAamp
   viral RNA Mini kit following the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions.

   2.3.2. Reverse Transcription. The RNA extracts were quan- tified with a
   NanoVue spectrophotometer (GE healthcare, Bucks, United Kingdom). The
   reverse transcription reaction was performed using the qScript cDNA
   SuperMix (Quanta BioSciences, Gaithersburg, USA). Briefly, 18Ì†µÌºáL
   containing 100 ng of RNA template in RNAse-free water and 2 Ì†µÌºáL of the
   qScript supermixweremixed and incubated for 5min at 25‚àòC followed by
   30min at 42‚àòC and 5min at 85‚àòC.

   2.3.3. Design of the Oligonucleotide Primers. The nucleo- protein N
   gene was used as target for the qRT-PCR. The primers were synthesized
   by Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium).

   The lyssavirus primers were chosen based on multiple align- ments of
   the N gene sequence from RABV, LBV, MOKV, DUVV, EBLV-1, EBLV-2, ABLV,
   WCBV, KHUV, and IRKV. Complete sequences of the nucleoprotein gene of
   each lyssavirus species were obtained from genomic databases and
   aligned by using the MEGA5 and the CLC Sequence Viewer software. The
   accession numbers of these viruses are shown in Table 3(a). External
   and nested primer sequences were chosen from regions conserved in all
   lyssavirus species. The RAB PCR1 F, RAB PCR1 R, and RAB qPCR F primers
   were designed in-house (Table 3(b)). The GRAB2R primer was described
   earlier by VaÃÅzquez-MoroÃÅn et al. [30]. Degenerate bases were included
   in the primers to account for the vari- ability in the sequences of
   different lyssavirus species. A first amplification round (PCR1) was
   performed using the RAB PCR1 F and RAB PCR1 R primers, which amplify a
   fragment of 343 bp of the N gene. 5 Ì†µÌºáL of the PCR product was diluted
   10x and then used in a real-time PCR with the RAB qRT- PCR F and GRAB2R
   primers, amplifying a 158 bp fragment within the first PCR amplicon.
   The RABV monospecific primers (RAB CVS-11 F and RAB CVS-11 R) were
   designed to specifically target the nucleoprotein N gene of CVS-11
   (accession number GU992321). They contain no degenerate bases (Table
   3(b)). The primers VETINHF2 and VETINHR1 were designed in-house to
   amplify a conserved sequence of the r18S ribosomal RNA gene and were
   usedto check for PCR inhibition and RNA quality [31, 32]. They can be
   used for samples from multiple animal species (Table 3(b)).

   2.3.4. Nested qPCR. The protocol consisted of a nested PCR strategywith
   two amplification steps. In the first amplification round (PCR1), 5Ì†µÌºáL
   of cDNA was mixed with a PCR master mix containing 10 Ì†µÌºáL of 5x
   reaction buffer, 1.5mM of MgCl

   2 ,

   0.2 U Taq polymerase (Promega, Madison, USA), 0.5Ì†µÌºáM of the primers RAB
   PCR1 F and RAB PCR1 R, 0.2mM of dNTP mix (Roche, Basel,
   Switzerland),and nuclease-free water to obtain a final volume of 50
   Ì†µÌºáL. The amplification was performed on an iCycler (Biorad, Hemel
   Hempstead, United Kingdom) according to the following program: 1min at
   95‚àòC for initial denaturation, followed by 25 cycles of 20 s at 95‚àòC
   (denaturation) and 40 s at 60‚àòC (annealing and extension), and a final
   step of 10min at 72‚àòC. The second amplification consisted of a
   real-time PCR performed on a CFX96 real-time PCR system (Biorad, Hemel
   Hempstead, United Kingdom).The reactionmix consisted of 12.5 Ì†µÌºáL of 2x
   SyberGreen Master Mix (Quanta BioSciences, Gaithersburg, USA), 5 Ì†µÌºáL of
   10x diluted PCR1 product and 0.8 Ì†µÌºáM of each primer (RAB qRT-PCR F and
   GRAB2R), and nuclease-free water to obtain a final volume of 25 Ì†µÌºáL.
   All samples were analyzed in duplicate. The program consisted of 2min
   at 95‚àòC for Taq activation and initial denaturation, followed by 45
   cycles of 20 s at 95‚àòC and 30 s at 61‚àòC. To check for the presence of
   primer dimers and nonspecific amplicons, a melting curve analysis was
   performed after each run (Bio- Rad CFX manager 2.1 software).

   A total of 45 cycles were ran in the qPCR. The inter- pretation of the
   qPCR results was done as follows: a sample with a Cq value ‚â§40 was
   considered positive and a Cq value

   value between 40 and 45 were always retested. The melting curve was
   analysed to check the specificity of the amplification.

   2.3.5. Sequencing Species Identification. The obtained ampli- cons were
   purified using the GFX PCR DNA kit (GE Health- care, PQ,USA) and
   quantifiedwith theNanoVue spectropho- tometer (GEHealthcare,
   PQ,USA).The sequencing reactions were performed using the RAB qRT-PCR F
   primer and the big dye terminator v.3.1 cycle sequencing kit (Applied
   Biosys- tem, CA, USA), according to themanufacturer‚Äôs instructions.

   As starting material, 1‚Äì3 ng of the purified PCR fragment was used. The
   cycle PCR reactions were performed on an iCycler fromBiorad, programmed
   as follows: a first denaturation step of 1min at 96‚àòC and 25 cycles
   consisting of 10 s at 96‚àòC and 4min at 60‚àòC. Final products were
   purified by precipitation by adding 5 Ì†µÌºáL of 125mMEDTA/sodium acetate
   3M solution and 60 Ì†µÌºáL of ethanol 100%. The sequencing reactions were
   analysed on an ABI Prism 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystem,
   California, USA). The obtained sequences were matched with the
   sequences stored in the National Center for Biotechnology Information
   (NCBI) database, using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST).

   2.4. RABV-Specific qRT-PCR. The RABV-specific qRT-PCR consisted of a
   single amplification step and was performed on a CFX96 real-time system
   from Biorad (Hemel Hempstead, United Kingdom). Each 25Ì†µÌºáL reaction
   mixture consisted of 12.5 Ì†µÌºáL of 2x Sybr Green Master Mix (Quanta
   BioSciences, Gaithersburg, USA), 5Ì†µÌºáL of diluted cDNA, and 0.4 Ì†µÌºáM of
   each primer. All samples were analyzed in duplicate. The amplification
   program consisted of 2min initial denaturation at 95‚àòC, followed by 45
   cycles of 20 s at 95‚àòC and 30 s of annealing and extension at 62‚àòC. A
   melting curve analysis was performed in order to verify the absence of
   primer dimers and the specificity of the obtained amplicons after each
   run (Bio-Rad CFX manager 2.1 software). The correlation between Cq
   values of both qRT-PCRmethods was calculated with the Pearson‚Äôs
   correlation test (GraphPad Prism 6 soft- ware).

   3. Results

   3.1. Diagnostic Sensitivity

   3.1.1. Spectrum of Lyssavirus Detection. All positive samples (Ì†µÌ±õ = 69)
   that contained either one of 7 different lyssavirus species (Table 2)
   were tested positive with the lyssavirus qRT- PCR, yielding a
   sensitivity of 100% for the assay. Some of the rare species (WCBV,
   IRKV, KHUV, IKOV, SHIBV, and BBLV) were not tested, but in silico
   alignment of the targeted region in the nucleoprotein gene of these
   species demonstrated a sufficient match with the degenerate primers to
   allow amplification (Figure 1). No primer dimers were detected. The
   obtained amplicons were also checked by agarose gel analysis and had
   the expected size of 158 bp (data not shown).

   To demonstrate the superior sensitivity of the two-step approach, the
   lyssavirus qRT-PCR was compared with a pre- viously published one-step
   lyssavirus qRT-PCR [33]. Serial dilutions of 2 virus-positive samples
   from the 2013 annual international proficiency test from ANSES (Nancy,
   France) were compared. The samples contained a RABV isolate from a dog
   (Canis lupus familiaris), or an EBLV-1 isolate from a bat (Eptesicus
   serotinus). The virus-positive samples were diluted ten-fold and tested
   by both protocols. The obtained results

   are presented in Table 4. The two-step approach was 10 times more
   sensitive than the one-step approach [33].

   3.1.2. Comparison of the Course of an Experimental RABV Virus Infection
   inMiceDetermined byGeneric Lyssavirus qRT- PCR, RABV Monospecific
   qRT-PCR, and FAT. Mice were inoculated intranasally with rabies virus
   and brain tissue was sampled at different DPI for analysis. qRT-PCR
   results were expressed in delta Cq values, which were calculated as
   follows: 45 ‚àí Cqsample (45 = the total number of cycles run in the
   qPCR). Viral RNA was first detected at 3 DPI (mean delta Cq of 4.2),
   which was followed by an increase of the viral RNA load at 5 DPI (mean
   delta Cq of 23.2 at 5 DPI) (Figure 2(a)). The viral load reached a
   plateau from 7 DPI onwards (mean delta Cq of 26). Starting from 5 DPI,
   viral antigens could also be detected with the FAT and small amounts of
   infectious virus could be isolated from the brain (Figure 2(b)). At 5
   DPI, the virus titer ranged from 102 to 104 TCID

   50 /mL. The titer increased during the

   following days to reach a plateau, ranging between 104 and 106 TCID

   50 /mL at 8 DPI (Figure 2(c)). The Cq values obtained

   with the one-step monospecific qRT-PCR correlated well with the values
   obtained with the two-step lyssavirus qRT- PCR (Pearson value Ì†µÌ±ü =
   0.9773; Ì†µÌ±É < 0.001, GraphPad Prism 6) (Figure 2(d)). The generic
   lyssavirus qRT-PCR proved to be more sensitive than the FAT. Eleven
   mice that tested positive with the generic lyssavirus qRT-PCR at 3 and
   4 DPI, tested negative by the FAT. Uninfected control mice tested
   negative with both qRT-PCR methods and the FAT.

   3.2. Selectivity. For all samples, the sequence of the obtained
   amplicon could be assigned unequivocally to the correct species by
   comparing the nucleotide homology in the NCBI database (BLAST, highly
   similar sequences). Homology was in the range of 95‚Äì100% for RABV,
   MOKV, EBLV-1, EBLV-2, and ABLV and in the range of 85‚Äì87% for LBV and
   DUVV. Moreover, melting temperature profiles of the respective
   amplicons differed for the different species and no primer dimers were
   observed in any PCR run (Figure 3). The vesicular stomatitis virus
   (VSV) tested negative (undetectable Cq) with the generic lyssavirus
   qRT-PCR.

   50 of RABV (CVS-11) by intranasal inoculation and sacrificed 0 to 10
   days later. The brain was collected for analysis. The

   course of (a) viral RNA by generic lyssavirus qRT-PCR, (b) load of
   viral antigen (FAT), (c) infectious virus (RTCIT), and (d) correlation
   of Cq values between the generic lyssavirus and RABV-specific qRT-PCR
   are presented. The correlation between the Cq values obtained by both
   qRT-PCR methods was excellent (Pearson‚Äôs correlation coefficient Ì†µÌ±ü =
   0.9773, Ì†µÌ±É < 0.0001).

   3.3. Limit of Detection. The limit of detectionwas determined by
   analysing 10-fold serial dilutions of a suspension of RABV (CVS-11) and
   EBLV-1. RABV and EBLV-1 suspensions were produced in BHK-21 and
   neuroblastoma N2a cells, respectively. The titer of infectious virus
   was determined in

   cell culture.The virus was diluted from 106 to 10‚àí2 TCID 50 for

   RABV and from 104 to 10‚àí2 TCID 50

   for EBLV-1. For RABV, the viral RNA load was determined by both the
   generic and the RABV-specific qRT-PCR, while for EBLV-1, only the
   generic lyssavirus qRT-PCR was used. The obtained Cq

   values correlated well with the logarithm of the correspond- ing TCID

   50 values using a linear fit model (GraphPad Prism

   6) (Figure 4(a)). The limit of detection for RABV was 100 TCID

   50 for

   both qRT-PCR methods, with 100% positive replicates (6 different runs
   in duplicate). At the 10‚àí1 TCID

   50 and 10‚àí2

   TCID 50 dilutions, all replicates were negative (Cq value > 40

   or undetectable) with the generic lyssavirus qRT-PCR. For the RABV
   monospecific qRT-PCR, 8 replicates were positive and 4 replicates were
   negative at the 10‚àí1 TCID

   50 dilution.

   At the 10‚àí2 TCID 50

   dilution, 4 replicates were positive and 8 replicates were negative
   with the RABV-specific qRT-PCR (Figure 4(a)). Negative control samples
   (viral RNA substi- tuted by water) gave no signal with both qRT-PCR
   methods. The detection limit of EBLV-1 was determined at 10‚àí1 TCID

   50

   for the generic lyssavirus qRT-PCR. At 10‚àí1 TCID 50 , all

   replicates yielded positive results. At 10‚àí2 TCID 50 , 5 replicates

   yielded positive and 7 replicates yielded negative results (Cq value >
   40 or undetectable) (Figure 4(b)).

   The two-step protocol was also compared with a one-step qPCR round
   based on the same PCR1 or qPCRprimers, using samples from the 2011 and
   2013 annual ring test from ANSES (Nancy, France). A sample containing
   an ABLV isolate from an Australian bat (Pteropus Alecto) was diluted
   1/10, 1/100, 1/500, and 1/1000 and a sample containing a RABV isolate
   from a European red fox (Vulpes vulpes) was diluted 1/8, 1/100, and
   1/500. All dilutions tested positive with the two- step protocol.
   Depending on the dilution, Cq values ranged from 16 to 24. In contrast,
   the one-step protocol gave either no signal or high Cq values, ranging
   between 31 and 44 (data not shown). This underlines the need for the
   two amplification rounds to obtain acceptable sensitivity.

   3.4. Diagnostic Specificity. The diagnostic specificity was 100%. A
   total of 150 brains of rabies virus-free mammals, belonging to 5
   different species, tested negative by FAT and generic lyssavirus
   qRT-PCR (Table 1). Ten human cerebro- spinal fluid samples, 6 saliva
   samples, and 1 skin biopsy

   obtained from rabies-free patients with neurological symp- toms tested
   negative by qRT-PCR, yielding a diagnostic specificity of 100%. The
   qRT-PCR always yielded negative results upon substitution of the RNA by
   water in the different steps of the protocol (RNA extraction, reverse
   transcription, and two-step qPCR).

   3.5. Repeatability (Intra-Assay Variation). To assess the intra- assay
   variation, 3 samples (CVS-11, EBLV1, and water as a negative control)
   were tested in 10 replicates. The variation coefficient (Pearson
   r-GraphPad Prism 6) was 1.7% for CVS- 11 (at a mean Cq of 21.5) and
   0.89% for EBLV-1 (at a mean Cq of 24.3). The negative control remained
   undetectable in all replicates.

   3.6. Reproducibility (Inter-Assay Variation). The inter-assay precision
   was assessed by testing 3 samples (CVS-11, EBLV- 1, and water as a
   negative control) in 6 independent runs (Figure 4). The virus
   suspensions were diluted from 106 to 10 ‚àí2 TCID

   50 for CVS-11 and from 104 to 10‚àí2 TCID

   50 for

   EBLV-1.The Cq values increased with the viral load.The 95% confidence
   interval was calculated for all CVS-11 and EBLV-1 tested dilutions
   (Figure 4(c)).

   3.7. Matrix Effect. Brain tissue is the preferred specimen for
   postmortem diagnosis in both humans and animals, but this sample is not
   feasible for antemortem diagnosis. In the latter case, diagnosis is
   based on detection of virus or viral RNA in saliva, neck skin biopsy,
   or an impression of the cornea. To validate the generic lyssavirus qPCR
   on other matrices than brain tissue, CSF, saliva, and urine were spiked
   with different virus doses, ranging from 105 to 10‚àí1 TCID

   50 for

   RABV (CVS-11) and from 104 to 10‚àí2 TCID 50

   for EBLV-1. Each samplewas analysed in 3 different runs (RNA extraction
   followed by qPCR) and results were expressed in mean Cq values (Table
   5). PCR inhibition and RNA quality were checked by using r18S ribosomal
   RNA gene amplification. Virus could be detected in all testedmatrices
   (saliva, CSF, and urine). The limit of detection for EBLV-1 was 100
   TCID

   50 in

   CSF, saliva, and urine. The limit of detection for RABV was also 100
   TCID

   50 in urine but appeared higher in CSF (101

   TCID 50 ) and in saliva (102 TCID

   50 ).

   4. Discussion

   Real-time PCR provides significant methodological benefits for virus
   detection [34]. RT-PCR offers many advantages for rabies diagnosis, due
   to its high sensitivity, rapidity, no interference by inhibitors of
   virus infectivity or antibodies, practicability for samples which may
   contain only minute amounts of virus, such as cerebrospinal fluid or
   bat brain, and the possibility to quickly determine the species
   andmolecular phylogeny of the isolate. Several RT-PCR protocols for the
   detection of rabies virus have been published during the past decade.
   All protocols that recognise multiple lyssavirus species use degenerate
   primers [30, 33, 35‚Äì39] and most of them use the JW12 primer published
   by Heaton et al. 1997 [35]. A cocktail of nondegenerate/degenerate
   primers is only

   Figure 4: Analytical sensitivity of the monospecific RABV and the
   generic lyssavirus qRT-PCR for RABV (CVS-11) (a) and EBLV-1 (b). Six
   independent runs with each time two repeats were performed per virus
   dilution (10-fold serial dilution). There was an excellent linear
   regression between the load of infectious virus, determined by virus
   titration, and the Cq value for RABV and EBLV-1 (regression coefficient
   of 0.965 and 0.989, resp.). For both qRT-PCR methods, the limit of
   detection of RABV and EBLV-1 was ‚â§ 100 TCID

   50 . The Cq remained

   used in the protocols published by Heaton et al. in 1997 [35] and Black
   et al. in 2003 [36]. Three protocols are designed as a two-step PCR and
   all of them use a gel-based DNA system detection [30, 35, 39] while
   others are real-time one-step protocols [33, 36‚Äì38]. Only two protocols
   were validated for 7 species [30, 33]. The RT-PCR of VaÃÅzquez-MoroÃÅn et
   al. [30] uses a nested classical PCR system with degenerate primers and
   a gel-based DNA detection system. Real-time RT-PCR is however a more
   rapid and potentially more sensitive technique [34, 40]. Recently,
   Hayman et al. [33] validated the use of a real-time RT-PCR protocol for
   the detection of 7 lyssavirus species. They used a set of mildly
   degenerate primers that contained one or two degenerate bases per
   primer and were originally designed for the recognition of RABV,
   EBLV-1, and -2.

   In this study, a two-step generic lyssavirus qRT-PCR, capable of
   detecting 7 lyssavirus species (RABV, LBV,MOKV,

   DUVV, EBLV-1, EBLV-2, and ABLV), was developed and validated.The
   two-step approach allowsmaximumsensitivity in order to detect virus in
   typically small-size samples, such as bat brains or samples which
   contain only minute amounts of virus, such as CSF. A good in silico
   match of the primers with the N gene of the remaining 6 species (WCBV,
   IRKV, KHUV, IKOV, SHIBV, and BBLV) was also demonstrated. A cocktail of
   primers with 17 to 30% of degenerate bases, taking into account the
   variability of the different lyssavirus species, was designed for the
   assay. The primers target well- conserved regions of the N gene.
   Indeed, ample sequence data are available for the N gene and most of
   the published RT-PCR protocols use primers for the N gene [30, 33, 36‚Äì
   39, 41‚Äì43]. A large set of samples obtained from wild and domestic
   animals (bat, red fox, dog, and cat), human patients with nonrabies
   encephalitis, interlaboratory ring trials, and naturally and
   experimentally infected animals (bat andmice)

   1 TCID50 inCSF, and 10 2 TCID50 in saliva.

   For EBLV-1, the limit of detection was 100 TCID50 in CSF, saliva, and
   urine. ND: signal not detected.

   was tested. To check for PCR inhibition and RNA quality, the cellular
   r18S ribosomal RNA gene was used as a target. The r18S ribosomal RNA
   has been shown to be more reliable than Ì†µÌªΩ-actin [42, 44]. The
   diagnostic specificity was 100% and sensitivity proved superior to the
   fluorescent antigen test. The limit of detection was ‚â§1 TCID

   50 . Sequence analysis

   of the amplicon unequivocally assigned the correct species. The
   vesicular stomatitis virus (belonging to the related genus
   Vesiculovirus) was not recognized, confirming the selectivity of the
   degenerate primers.

   This qRT-PCR protocol is now routinely used for rabies surveillance in
   Belgium. Since 2001, Belgium has been offi- cially declared free of the
   classic rabies virus. However, bats are an important reservoir of
   lyssaviruses in Europe [45] and are still collected and tested in the
   frame of the Belgian rabies surveillance system [46].

   In experimentally infected mice, viral RNA was first detected at 3DPI
   in the brain, whereas first symptoms appeared much later at 8DPI.
   Symptoms involved depres- sion, loss of body weight, ruffled fur, and
   paralysis of the hind limbs. In general, results of the generic
   lyssavirus qRT-PCR, RABV-specific qRT-PCR, virus titration, and FAT
   correlated well and provided similar kinetic profiles throughout the
   infection.The qRT-PCR proved however to bemore sensitive than virus
   titration and FAT. Indeed, 11 out of 55 mice tested negative by FAT and
   positive by qRT-PCR. Also, 11 out 55 qRT-PCR-positive mice tested
   negative by RTCIT. Cycle

   thresholds obtained by the generic and the RABV-specific qRT-PCR were
   highly correlated.

   The virus species in the positive samples could be identified by
   sequencing. For some species, we observed different melting
   temperatures and curves, providing an early indication of the species
   prior to sequencing. The melting temperature, determined with the CFX96
   system from Biorad, was different for RABV, LBV, MOKV, EBLV- 1, and
   EBLV-2, whereas DUVV and ABLV had the same melting temperature (Figure
   3). The number of strains tested per species was however insufficient
   to accurately define the melting curve differentiation. It is also
   possible to obtain a more precise calculation by high resolutionmelt
   analysis [47], whichmay theoretically allow to discriminate all species
   prior to sequencing. This was not done for this study.

   To further assess the exactitude of our qPCR method, we participated to
   the consecutive international ring trials organised by ANSES (Nancy,
   France) from 2009 to 2013. Up to now, we reported very good compliant
   results in each trial. Moreover, we participated in the Epizone ring
   trial organised by the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute (FLI, Germany) in
   2011. The panel consisted of 30 samples prepared by the FLI and
   included RNA of 26 RABV isolated in different countries and years, an
   EBLV-1 and an EBLV-2 RNA sample, and a log10 serial dilution of RABV.
   We correctly reported all negative samples and 28 of the 30 positive
   samples, representing a sensitivity of 93.3%. Two samples with a Cq
   value >40 were considered as negative samples. These two false
   negatives could have been due to the fact that the samples were
   extracted and prepared in RSB50, a buffer different from the one used
   in our protocol. The RSB50 buffer contains the carrier poly A, which
   forced us to use a gene-specific reverse transcription kit (qScript
   Flex cDNA Synthesis kit, Quanta BioSciences, Gaithersburg, USA). Only 3
   of the 16 laboratories submitted 100% concordant results for RABV
   diagnosis [48].

   Despite the presence of 17 to 30% of degenerate bases in some of the
   primers, the lyssavirus qRT-PCR proved to be highly sensitive,
   specific, and reproducible. In our national reference laboratory, this
   technique is now used as the method of choice for antemortem rabies
   diagnosis and analysis of small-size samples, such as bat brain.
