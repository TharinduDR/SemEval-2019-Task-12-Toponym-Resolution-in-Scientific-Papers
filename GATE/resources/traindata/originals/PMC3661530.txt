Abstract
Microevolution of Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) was studied throughout a population cycle of its host, the bank vole (Myodes
glareolus). We monitored PUUV variants circulating in the host population in Central Finland over a five-year period that
included two peak-phases and two population declines. Of 1369 bank voles examined, 360 (26.3%) were found infected
with PUUV. Partial sequences of each of the three genome segments were recovered (approx. 12% of PUUV genome) from
356 bank voles. Analyses of these sequences disclosed the following features of PUUV evolution: 1) nucleotide substitutions
are mostly silent and deduced amino acid changes are mainly conservative, suggesting stabilizing selection at the protein
level; 2) the three genome segments accumulate mutations at a different rate; 3) some of the circulating PUUV variants are
frequently observed while others are transient; 4) frequently occurring PUUV variants are composed of the most abundant
segment genotypes (copious) and new transient variants are continually generated; 5) reassortment of PUUV genome
segments occurs regularly and follows a specific pattern of segments association; 6) prevalence of reassortant variants
oscillates with season and is higher in the autumn than in the spring; and 7) reassortants are transient, i.e., they are not
competitively superior to their parental variants. Collectively, these observations support a quasi-neutral mode of PUUV
microevolution with a steady generation of transient variants, including reassortants, and preservation of a few preferred
genotypes.

Introduction
Hantaviruses constitute a distinct genus within the Bunyaviridae
[1]. This family is represented by enveloped negative-stranded
RNA viruses that possess a tri-segmented genome: the small (S)
segment encodes the nucleocapsid (N) protein and, in some
hantaviruses, also a non-structural protein (NSs); the medium (M)
segment encodes two surface glycoproteins (Gn and Gc); and the
large (L) segment encodes the L protein, the viral RNA-dependent
RNA polymerase [2].
Puumala virus (PUUV) [3] is the main rodent-borne pathogen in
Europe, where it causes nephropathia epidemica (NE), a relatively mild
form of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome [4]. The host of
PUUV is the bank vole (Myodes glareolus), a woodland rodent that
occurs from the British Isles through continental Europe and
Russia to the Lake Baikal [5]. The occurrence of NE depends
strongly on the population dynamics of the bank vole; population
peaks are mirrored by NE outbreaks with a short time-lag [6–8].
Bank voles are chronically infected by PUUV [9–10]. Viral
secretion occurs during half a year after infection [9], [11] and the
virus transmission is horizontal, mainly via breathing of aerosol-
ized excreta generated by infected rodents [12–14]. Such indirect
mode of transmission and virus survival outside the host promotes
viral persistence in the bank vole population [15–16]. Maternal
antibodies transferred by infected females to their progeny protect
them up to 80 days, and this may shape the dynamics of virus
transmission during breeding season and shortly thereafter [17–
18]. Similar to other RNA viruses, hantaviruses exhibit a high
short-term substitution rate. Genetic diversity in hantaviruses is
generated by genetic drift (i.e., a gradual accumulation of point
mutations throughout the genome coupled with small deletions
and insertions within the non-coding regions of the RNA segments
[19]) and reassortment of genome segments [19–22]. Evidence for
homologous recombination has also been reported [23–24], but
this seems to be a rare event [25]. While the vast majority of point
mutations observed are silent, reflecting stabilizing selection at the
aa level [26], there is some evidence for directional selection [27].
Genetic heterogeneity is comparable among hantaviruses species
found in different rodent subfamilies. Nucleotide (nt) diversity
among hantavirus species is variable and characterized by the
number of strains recognized. Inter-lineage diversity of PUUV
may be as high as 38% for the S segment, and sequence
heterogeneity is unevenly distributed along the genome [28].
Despite the growing database of genome sequences and the
increasing number of studies on genetic variability of hantaviruses,
none to date have considered the nature of viral genetic diversity
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 May 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e64447
on a scale of a host population and sampled during several-years
period. However, such studies of virus microevolution are essential
for a better understanding of the mechanisms shaping hantavirus
evolution. Previously [19], we examined PUUV genetic diversity
in a bank vole population. This study included 31 distinct viral
strains circulating during 2005 in Central Finland. A substantial
genetic diversity was observed between circulating PUUV strains.
Moreover, phylogenetic analysis of the S, M and L genome
sequences clustered the variation into two distinct genogroups. As
such, recognition of reassortant strains was straightforward and
20% of the circulating PUUV strains were found to be carrying
inter-genogroup reassortant genomes. This analysis raised several
questions concerning temporal fluctuations of the diversity of
PUUV strains, how it is influenced by the host population density,
and the fate of individual PUUV strains. Here, we expand our
earlier study and report the microevolution of PUUV in its host
population during a five-year period, covering both peak and
decline phases of the bank vole population cycle.
Materials and Methods
Ethics statement
According to the Finnish Act on the Use of Animals for
Experimental Purposes (62/2006) and a further decision by the
Finnish Animal Experiment Board (May 16th, 2007), the
techniques employed to capture rodents, i.e., life- and snap-
trapping are not considered an animal experiment and therefore
requires no animal ethics license from the Finnish Animal
Experiment Board. The species captured for this study, Myodes
glareolus, neither is protected nor included in the Red List of
Finnish Species. Animal trapping took place on private and
Finnish national forest by permit (1013/204/2002). Landowners
were consulted and the trapping was allowed before the study was
conducted.
Sampling of rodents
Rodents were trapped at Konnevesi, Central Finland (62u349N,
26u249E) twice a year (May and October) from 2005 till 2009.
During the early 2000s, bank voles were strongly cyclical in
Central Finland [7]; 2005 was a cyclic peak year, 2006 decline and
crash, 2007 a strong increase phase, 2008 a high peak, and 2009
another decline. Trapping was done at 38 sites within 120 km2
of
typical taiga forest, mainly dominated by Norway spruce (Picea
abies), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), downy birch (Betula pubescens) and
silver birch (Betula pendula). Of 38 trapping sites, 14 were sampled
from May 2005 to October 2009 using grids of 363 Ugglan
Special live traps (Grahnab, Hillerstorp, Sweden) set 15 m apart.
Traps were set for three nights and checked twice per day to
minimize animal stress. From May 2007 onwards, 24 additional
trapping sites were added to increase the study material. These
consisted of 4 transects of 15 standard snap-traps at 15 m intervals
over two nights. The trapping sites were situated 500 to 1000 m
apart from each other. Bank voles captured alive were anesthe-
tized with isofluarene (Forene, Abbott, UK), bled from the retro-
orbital sinus and sacrificed by cervical dislocation and immediately
frozen. Similarly, snap-trapped bank voles were flash-frozen on
dry ice until necropsy. The dissection of rodents was performed in
a class II laminar flow hood in a biosafety level 3, animal
annotation (weight, sex, maturity, age) was completed and tissue
samples were individually deep-frozen until further analyses.
Screening of samples
All rodents were first screened for the presence of PUUV N-
antigen (Ag) using immunoblotting. Briefly, lung tissue samples
(approx. 20 mg) in 500 ml of Laemmli buffer were incubated at
room temperature overnight, then homogenized by sonication and
heated to 80–100uC for 5 minutes. Aliquots of 25 ml were
separated by electrophoresis in 10% sodium dodecyl sulphate
polyacrylamide gels and proteins were subsequently transferred
onto nitrocellulose membranes. To verify the blotting efficacy,
membranes were stained with 16Ponceau S staining solution for
1 minute and destained in distilled water until the background was
clear. Membranes were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin
solution overnight at +4uC. Membranes were incubated with
rabbit polyclonal antiserum made against recombinant N-Ag for
two hours at room temperature, washed with 0.1% Ten-Tween20
solution, and incubated for one hour with Odyssey IRDye 800CW
goat anti-rabbit secondary Ab (LI-COR), diluted at 1:10000 in
PBS. Odyssey Infrared Imaging system was used to detect blotted
proteins.
RT-PCR and sequencing of the PUUV genome
Viral RNA was extracted from lung tissue samples of the N-Ag-
positive bank voles using the TRIsure reagent (Bioline, UK)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Reverse transcription
was performed with RevertAidTM
H Minus M-MuLV Reverse
Transcriptase (Fermentas, Lithuania) and AmpliTaqH DNA
polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) was used
to amplify viral cDNA. PUUV S- (nt 631–1085), M- (nt 2162–
2613) and L-segment (nt 505–1040) sequences were amplified as
described earlier [19]. PCR amplicons were purified with
ExoSAP-ITTM
PCR clean-up reagent (USB Corporation, Miles
Road, Cleveland, USA). Automated sequencing was performed
using the ABI PRISMTM
Dye Terminator sequencing kit (Perkin
Elmer/ABI). Newly recovered S-, M- and L-segment sequences
(455, 452 and 536 nt in length respectively) were deposited in
GenBank under accession numbers JQ319161–JQ319319.
Genetic variation and phylogenetic analysis
Nucleotide sequence alignments were generated with BioEdit
v7.0.9 [29]. Genetic distances were estimated within and between
viral populations with DnaSP [30]. PHYLIP program package
[31] was employed to estimate phylogeny of the PUUV sequences.
Genetic distances were calculated with the F84 substitution model
(Dnadist) and bootstrap supports were obtained generating 1000
replicates of the datasets (Seqboot) and for the reconstruction of
PUUV phylogenies the Neighbour-joining (NJ) algorithm (Neigh-
bor) was used. Sequence alignments were submitted to phyloge-
netic Network 4.600 software (Fluxus-Engineering) to generate
genetic and evolutionary relationships among the segment
genotypes using Median-Joining algorithm [32]. An examination
of recombination among complete sequences was performed using
the recombination detection program (RDP) [33] and SimPlot
v3.5.1 [34].
Results
PUUV prevalence and genetic diversity in the bank vole
population at Konnevesi
The incidence of PUUV infection and genetic variation of the
virus were monitored through a complete bank vole population
cycle at Konnevesi from May 2005 until October 2009. The study
period covered two peak-phases in 2005 and 2008, and two
population declines in 2006 and 2009 (presumably followed by
virus bottlenecks). A total of 1369 bank voles were captured, of
which 360 (26.3%) were PUUV-N-Ag-positive. PUUV prevalence
at Konnevesi was higher in spring (a mean of 39%) when most

voles in the population have over-wintered rather than in autumn
(20.7%) when younger animals dominate (Table 1).
Partial genome sequences were recovered from 356 PUUV N-
Ag-positive bank voles: 455 nt for the S segment, 452 nt for the M
segment and 536 nt for the L segment. Direct sequencing of PCR-
products was employed; this way the master sequences were
recovered and the ‘‘noise’’ of quasispecies ignored. Taken
together, partial S-, M- and L-sequences (a total of 1443 nt)
represented 12% of the PUUV genome. Of 356 PUUV genomes,
M-segment sequences were recovered for 353 genomes (interest-
ingly, all the remaining were reassortant). Pairwise sequence
analysis revealed 182 nt differences in the segments analyzed: 53
mutations in the S, 50 in the M, and 79 in the L. The majority of
mutations were silent and occasionally non-synonymous substitu-
tions were encountered (Table 2). Numerous genetic markers were
found along the studied segments: 10 for the S (T699C, T750C,
T789A, A810G, G843A, T876C, G936A, T945C, C1014T,
T1044C), 7 for the M (C2180T, C2207T, A2216G, G2471A,
A2483G, G2543A, C2567T) and 29 for the L (G514T, G523A,
T532C, C538T, G656A, C593T, G601A, G679A, C682T,
A742G, A754G, G769A, C829T, A832G, T838C, G904A,
T910C, G916A, A922G, C928T, A964T, C967T, A982T/G,
A988T/C, A1003G, A1006G, C1009T, T1025C, C1034T)
(Table 2). Such genetic markers allowed the recognition and
discrimination of two genogroups (i.e., genetically related strains
within a virus lineage) referred as ‘‘A’’ and ‘‘B’’ and represented in
the figures in red and blue colors respectively. These groups were
also inferred from phylogenetic analyses of sequence data (Fig. 1).
Genetic diversity of PUUV segments within genogroups was
similar for all segments (1.5–3.2%). Inter-genogroup diversity
varied from 4.8 to 10.1%; surprisingly, the highest values were
attributed to the L segment. Furthermore, a non-synonymous
substitution was found in the L protein that could be used as a
molecular marker for genogrouping; in the genogroup A, the aa
residue at position 83 was isoleucine while in the genogroup B this
residue was valine (Table 2).
Genotyping of Konnevesi PUUV strains
Genetic diversity of circulating PUUV strains was evaluated,
and the number of circulating genotypes (i.e., genetically unique
representatives of each of the virus segments) estimated. A total of
45 S-segment genotypes, 38 M-segment genotypes and 61 L-
segment genotypes were recognized. Genogroup A included 11 S-,
18 M-, and 26 L-segment genotypes referred respectively as S1A
to S11A, M1A to M18A and L1A to L26A. Corresponding
numbers for genogroup B were 34, 20 and 35 and respectively
referred as S1B to S34B, M1B to M20A and L1B to L35B (Table 2
and Fig. 1). Variants of genogroup B were generally more
abundant and diverse (Table 1 and Fig. 2). The 356 PUUV
sequences comprised 184 distinct genetic variants. Of those, 46
belonged to genogroup A (ASAMAL), 82 to genogroup B
(BSBMBL), and 56 were reassortants between these groups
(Fig. 1E). Interestingly, only 39 of these 184 distinct variants were
found repeatedly over the observation period; other variants were
registered only once (Table 3). No accumulation of certain variants
at the given geographic sites was observed. Neither substantial
deviation in diversity between sites nor any bias linked to the
terrain topology was registered.
An independent analysis of each segment of PUUV genomes
allowed the distinction of the most abundant genotypes (from here
on referred to as ‘‘copious’’): 6A, 7A, 8A, 5B, 20B, 21B, 22B and
28B for the S segment; 1A, 8A, 14A, 15A, 3B, 8B and 15B for the
M segment; and 3A, 9A, 14A, 4B, 8B, 11B, 19B, 21B and 23B for
the L segment. Figure 2 shows the frequency of occurrence of the
segment genotypes as well as their relationships. Clusters of several
genotypes can be seen for the S and M segments of both
genogroups. These clusters consist of at least one copious genotype
and several genotypes that were seldom observed (from here on
referred to as ‘‘sporadic’’). For example, the copious S genotype 28B
and sporadic genotypes 27B, 30B, 31B, 32B, 33B, 34B form such a
cluster. Differently, the L segment was represented by more
genotypes, probably reflecting a higher nt substitutions rate in this
segment. Thus high number of drifted nt resulted in abundant
genetically-related variants illustrated in interconnected circles of a
smaller size in the graphical representation of the segment
genotypes (Fig. 2).

Dynamics of PUUV variants during a bank vole
population cycle
Relatively large collection of PUUV sequences recovered over a
5-year period gave a unique opportunity to follow individual
genetic variants of the virus through phases of high and low
population density. Analysis of segment genotypes dynamics
revealed that the copious genotypes were prevalent throughout
the observation window whereas most of sporadic genotypes were
transient, only a few of them were observed on more than one
occasion. New genotypes were continually detected during the
study, except in 2006 when no PUUV-infected voles were found
(Fig. 3). In other words, the PUUV genes pool was unique at every
time-point. Table 4 shows variants that have derived from one or a
few nt substitutions, reflecting the contribution of genetic drift to
PUUV diversity. Importantly, no evidence for a founder effect (the
loss of genetic variation that occurs when a subpopulation of a
small number of individuals is established [35]) was observed for
the segment genotypes after a decline in the bank vole population
(presumably a virus bottleneck). To analyze PUUV strains
dynamics, we classified circulating variants into four categories:
(i) the most frequently occurring variants, each detected five or
more times; (ii) repeatedly observed variants, detected 2–4 times;
(iii) transient variants, detected only once; and (iv) reassortant
variants, which were analyzed separately due to their peculiar
genetic nature (Table 5). The most frequently occurring variants
($5 times) included only copious genotypes for each genome
segment. Two of these variants were clearly dominant: A13 was
observed 53 times from May 2007 to October 2009, and B3 was
observed 21 times from October 2007 to October 2008.
Repeatedly observed variants (2–4 times) were detected at no
more than two study points (Table 4). Of those repeatedly
observed variants, 74% of S segments, 67% of M segments and
approx. 30% of L segments were of copious genotypes. For the
transient variants (1 time), all three segments were represented by
copious and sporadic segment genotypes in approximately equal
proportions.
Reassortant variants
Co-circulation of two distinct genogroups of PUUV allowed for
straightforward recognition and subsequent study of reassortants
variants. In total, 68 of 356 (19.1%) PUUV genomes were found
to be reassortant. They were represented by 56 distinct variants
and only three of those were observed more than once throughout
the study period (Table 3). All six possible combinations of PUUV
genome segments were found among reassortant strains and,
interestingly, a certain pattern of segment combination was
observed. In the vast majority of cases (95.6%) only the S or M
segments were exchanged (Table 6). In other words, the L segment
preferably remained paired with S- or M-segments of the same
genogroup. Reassortant variants consisted of copious S- and M-
segment genotypes in 75% and 66% of cases respectively, whereas
the L genome segment was equally composed of copious and sporadic
genotypes (Table 4). The composition of copious and sporadic
genotypes was similar for both repeatedly observed and reassortant
variants. However, the repeatedly observed variants could be seen
at two different time-points, while reassortants were transient with
the exception of three variants detailed in Table 5. The proportion
of reassortants in the viral population varied from spring to
autumn and was inversely related to PUUV prevalence, i.e. was

higher in autumn when the prevalence is lower, and lower in
spring when the prevalence is higher (Table 1). These oscillations
were not observed for parental variants.
Double infections
A prerequisite for PUUV reassortment is the coexistence of two
viral genomes in the same host, i.e. a double infection. Visual
inspection of sequence chromatograms revealed double peaks at
the diagnostic positions for genogroups in twelve sequences: six for
the S segment, two for the M segment and four for the L segment.
Double peaks were distributed not randomly along the sequences
but appeared exclusively at the genotype-specific positions. Hence,
such double peaks cannot result from simultaneous nt substitution
at given positions reflect a double-infection. Detected double
infections with two genotypes were not observed circulating as
reassortant variants. Sequencing of individual cDNA clones
showed the presence of two strains of the virus (one of each
genogroup) and hence confirmed a double infection in the host.
Interestingly, all but one sequence with double peaks were
recovered from samples collected in October when conditions
for double infections seem to be higher (see Discussion).
To search for traces of recombination in PUUV genomes
circulating at Konnevesi, four variants, two of each genogroup (A
and B), were selected and their complete S and M segment
sequences and approx. 80% of the L segment sequence were
recovered and analysed. No apparent signs of recombination were
observed. Although this result does not completely exclude the
possibility of recombination, it suggests that recombination occurs
much less frequently than reassortment. An alternative explana-
tion could be that recombinant viruses, even if generated
frequently, may not be able to replicate as efficiently as parental
viruses or reassortants.
Discussion
For the first time, the microevolution of PUUV has been studied
throughout the host population cycle. The data set analyzed here
(1369 bank voles of which 360 were PUUV infected) was indeed
larger than in our preceding study [19], in which 147 bank voles
captured in 2005 and 40 PUUV genomes were analyzed. The
present results support and expand our earlier conclusions
concerning PUUV genetic diversity and the frequency of segment
reassortment. In addition, the five-year monitoring of PUUV
genomes allowed the study of PUUV microevolution, particularly,
to follow the fate of individual genetic variants, including
reassortants.
Of 1369 bank voles captured, 360 were found infected and 356
PUUV genome sequences were successfully recovered. Although
not statistically significant, PUUV prevalence tend to be higher in
the spring when most bank voles were mature and had over-
wintered, than in the autumn when animals born the summer

before predominate (Table 1). This observation is in concordance
with other studies on PUUV prevalence [18], [36–37].
Earlier analyses of circulating PUUV in the same host
population at Konnevesi revealed two distinct genogroups, A
and B [19]. Both genogroups were present in the viral population
along the monitoring period with a sole exception; no variants of
the group B were detected in October 2009 (Table 1 and Fig. 3). It
cannot be clarified here if this is a reflection of the low numbers of
that sample set or that genogroup suddenly disappear. Genogroup
B was generally more abundant and diverse (Table 1 and Fig. 3).
The ratio of circulating A and B variants was relatively stable
through the host density cycle, except during the decline phases in
2006 and 2009 (Table 1), and no clear signs of competition
between genogroups were detected during the study. To our
knowledge, competition between hantavirus variants has only been

M- and L-segment genotypes was constructed using Network. Genotypes of group A are represented by red circles and genotypes of group B by
blue circles. The size of the circles is proportional to the number of representatives of each genotype; and numbers are shown inside. Most abundant
circulating genotypes (copious) are designated in red and blue, for the A and B genogroups, respectively. Sporadic genotypes, detected only once, are
shown in black and sporadic genotypes observed through several seasons are shown in a square. Yellow circles are median vectors suggested by
Network. The numbers on the link-lines show the number of mutations between genotypes; the length of link-lines is not proportional to the number
of mutations. Note that the trapping effort was increased from 2007 thus numbers from 2005 are not directly comparable to those of 2007–09.

studied in cell culture [38–39] and corresponding data for other
RNA viruses are limited (e.g. [40]).
The PUUV population was composed of several segment
genotypes, L genotypes being more numerous than S or M
genotypes. The range of genetic diversity within each genogroup
was comparable for all three segments and, for the S and M
segments also the inter-genogroup diversity was similar. In
contrast, L-segment sequences showed surprisingly high diversity
between the two genogroups (Table 2). It should be emphasized
that the variability of the L segment region selected for our analysis
(nt 505–1040) is typical of the segment among PUUV strains.
Therefore, a likely explanation for the high inter-genogroup
diversity of L segment could involve an independent evolutionary
history of those genome segments of the Konnevesi strains.

Most abundant (copious) segment genotypes are in bold and underlined. Shadowed blocks contain variants that might have derived from 1–2 point mutations in one
or two segments (e.g., strains A13 and A16 could have originated by accumulating one or two mutations, respectively, in the L segment of A11 strains).

Phylogenetic analysis supported this hypothesis: the L sequences of
genogroup A shared a MRCA with PUUV Sotkamo strain while
genogroup B shared the MCRA with PUUV Pallasjärvi strain,
both strains (i.e., certain genetic variant of a virus species) belong
to the Finnish genetic lineage (Fig. 1A–C). Different evolutionary
histories for PUUV genome segments were earlier suggested to
account for observed variation in the Alpe-Adrian [41] and
Latvian [42] lineages. Incidentally, 60 km south-east of the
Konnevesi study area, at Pieksämäki, only variants of genogroup
A were observed [43]. Whether this is a consequence of
competition between A and B variants or peculiarity of their
geographical distribution remains unclear. Extended monitoring
of the PUUV variants in circulation is required to clarify this issue.
In Finland, PUUV prevalence fluctuates seasonally. However,
this study shows that genetic composition of the viral population is
not dependent of such seasonality. At each sampling point the
PUUV population was roughly renewed; some genetic variants
(i.e., sets of three genome segments) were observed persisting
throughout the study but a large number were observed only
temporarily (Table 3). In contrast, many of the segment genotypes
were detected throughout the entire study period (Fig. 3). In other
words, the survival of segment genotypes seems independent of the
circulating variants, suggesting that genome segments persists
independently and not in combination with other segments within
the viral population. A factor that could account such outcome
may be the frequent reassortment between PUUV variants, both
closely- and distantly-related.
The most frequently occurring PUUV variants were always
composed of copious genotypes. Transient variants seem to result
from copious segment genotypes by accumulating nt substitutions,
suggesting that viral genome segments are continuously drifting to
provide the PUUV population with a diverse base from which to
respond to new stressors. The three reassortant variants that were
repeatedly detected throughout the study were composed of copious
segment genotypes (Table 4), suggesting that they have a higher
chance of co-infecting a host and/or have a pronounced ability to
replace sporadic segment genotypes in a double infection scenario.
Variants composed of sporadic segment genotypes are likely to be
replaced when a co-infection occurred, thus only the dominant
(i.e., copious) variants remain.
A substantial portion of co-circulating PUUV strains (19.1%)
possessed a reassortant genome. Altogether, 56 distinct reassortant
variants were observed. The majority of reassortants (53 of 56)
were transient, suggesting that reassortants did not outcompete
parental variants. The analysis of a large number of PUUV
genomes allowed for the detection of all six possible reassortant
types (Table 6). This finding proved that all reassortant types are
viable in natural conditions, agreeing with the in vitro reassortment
of orthobunyaviruses [44]. Different PUUV reassortants were
found with different frequencies: in the vast majority of
reassortants (95.6%), either L and S segments or L and M
segments belonged to the same genogroup. Such a pattern of
segments’ combination suggests that reassortant types may differ in
their replication efficacy. Unique reassortant variants were
observed during every sampling event of the study (except 2006,
when no PUUV was detected), and tended to be more prevalent in
the autumn, even-tough the rates differences were not statistically
significant. Seasonality of reassortment could be explained by
seasonal variations in the age structure of the host population.
During autumn, most bank voles are younger and recent infections

are more likely to occur during a narrow time-window. Hence,
double infections in naive bank voles become more likely and the
conditions more favorable for reassortment. Indeed, 11 of the 12
double infections were detected in the autumn samples, whether
were shed as parental or reassortant strains remain unknown.
Apparently, only inter-species, inter-lineage or inter-genogroup
PUUV reassortants could be clearly recognized. In nature, when
genome segments are exchanged between closely related variants
(i.e., between variant of the same genogroup), reassortants might
be very difficult to detect. Such ‘‘imperceptible’’ reassortment
could be a useful mechanism to maintain a steady state in the
PUUV population. For example, it could counteract the effects of
‘Muller’s ratchet’ [45–46]. Experiments with the segmented RNA
W6 virus support the notion that reassortment can reduce an
excessive mutational load in a population and hence helps to avoid
the accumulation of deleterious effects [47–48].
To conclude, for the first time the microevolution of a
hantavirus was studied throughout a population cycle of its host.
Analyses of 356 PUUV genomes circulating in a bank vole
population over a five-year period allowed to study the mecha-
nisms of viral genetic diversification and follow the fate of variants.
The few PUUV variants that survived over several seasons did not
show any sign of a founder effect. Collectively, the observations
supported a quasi-neutral mode of PUUV microevolution with a
steady generation of transient variants, including reassortants, and
preservation of a few preferred genetic variants over several
seasons/years.
