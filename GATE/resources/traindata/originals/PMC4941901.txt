Background Recent studies have revealed the existence of genetic
diversity in swine influenza viruses (SIVs) in the world. In
Thailand, there has been a little information on the molecular
characteristics of the SIVs since the first isolation of viruses of
H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes in the late 1970s. Our previous study
demonstrated that Thai H1N1 SIVs possessed the classical swine
H1 and avian-like swine N1 genes (Takemae et al., Proceedings of
the Options for the Control of Influenza VI.2007;350–353).
Objectives In the present study, we genetically characterized 12
SIVs including those of H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2 subtypes isolated
between 2000 and 2005.
Methods We determined the entire nucleotide sequences of the
eight gene segments of those isolates.
Results Phylogenetic analysis revealed the existence of nine
distinct genotypes amongst the Thai SIVs. These genotypes arose
from multiple introductions of classical swine, avian-like swine
and human viruses. The existence of two distinct sublineages
within classical swine H1 and NS, avian-like swine PA and M and
human H3 and N2 genes of the Thai SIVs suggested that
introduction of viruses of classical swine, avian-like swine and
human origins occurred twice respectively into the Thai pig
population. The predominance of avian-like swine genes amongst
the Thai SIVs was evident. In particular, three polymerase (PB1,
PB2 and PA) and matrix genes of avian-like swine origin were
retained in all the Thai SIVs examined.
Conclusions These observations may suggest that genes of avian-
like swine lineages have some advantages to be maintained in pigs
as seen in the SIVs established through multiple introductions in
other regions.

Introduction
Swine influenza was first described in the United States in
1918 when the Spanish Flu pandemic occurred in the
human population.1,2
Typical clinical signs in pigs are respi-
ratory diseases with fever, coughing and nasal discharge, as
in humans. Anorexia and diarrhoea that are directly associ-
ated with reducing body weight are also occasionally
involved.3
These signs may result in serious economic losses
when pigs are raised and fattened on farms. Thus, although
swine influenza results in low mortality, it has been recog-
nized as an important pathogen in the swine industry.2
Recent genetic and antigenetical analyses have revealed
complicated features of the evolutionary diversity of swine
influenza viruses (SIVs). In Europe, H3N2 viruses possess-
ing genes encoding internal proteins related to avian-like
swine H1N1 and surface antigens related to human H3N2
viruses were isolated from Italian pigs in the 1980s and con-
tinued to circulate in Italian pigs since then.4,5
In 1998, at
least two different genotypes of SIV of the H3N2 subtype
emerged amongst the pig population in the USA by the
introduction of human, classical swine and avian viruses6
and one of them has established new lineage in North
America.7
In addition to those, SIVs of the H4N6 subtype
were isolated from pigs in Canada,8
and SIVs of the H9N2
subtype have been reported to circulate in China.9,10
The
segmented nature of the influenza genome and receptor
molecules in the swine respiratory tract contributes to such
evolutionary diversity of SIVs.1
This segmented nature
enables influenza viruses to exchange their genes when
viruses of two or more different origins infect a host at the
same time. The existence of 2-3 and 2-6 linked sialic acid in
the swine respiratory tract allows type A influenza viruses of
human and avian origin to infect pigs.11

The pig industry in Thailand has developed as one of
the major livestock industries since 1970s. Production of
pig meat in Thailand had tripled in the 37 years from 1971
to 2006.12
The number of pig farms including breeding
and fattening farm also has increased about four times in
the last decade.13
About 34 000 pig farms were scattered
throughout the country in 2006, in which over 70% was
dominated by small farms having 10–50 pigs; large produc-
ers having more than 500 pigs were only 6%.13
Although SIVs of H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes were first
isolated in the 1970s in Thailand,14,15
little information on
SIVs had been obtained in Thailand until recently. Contin-
uous surveillance by the National Institute of Animal
Health in Thailand since 2000 demonstrated the co-circula-
tion of three subtypes, H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2, amongst
the swine population in Thailand,16
raising the possibility
that evolutionary diversity of SIVs may exist in Thailand as
seen in other region of the world. Our previous phylo-
genetic study demonstrated that H1N1 Thai isolates pos-
sessed an evolutionarily distinct set of surface antigens, that
was the H1 gene derived from the classical swine lineage
and the N1 gene from the avian-like swine lineage,17
this
finding has been also supported by Chutinimitku et al.18
In
order to explore the extent of the genetic diversity, we
determined the whole sequences of all eight gene segments
of the Thai strains isolated between 2000 and 2005, consist-
ing of one H1N1 strain and five strains of the H3N2 sub-
type as well as all gene segments encoding internal proteins
of five H1N1 and one H1N2 strains whose surface antigen
genes were sequenced in our previous study.17
Phylogenetic
and regression analyses were applied to those sequences to
identify the genetic origin and the genetic relationship
between the Thai isolates and other SIVs circulating in the
world and to elucidate the evolutional pathways of the Thai
isolates.
Materials
Viruses
Nasal swabs of pigs have been periodically collected from
the farms mainly in the central regions of Thailand by
the National Institute of Animal Health, Thailand since
2000. All the 12 viruses available at the National Institute
of Animal Health, Thailand, which were isolated from six
provinces of Thailand between 2000 and 2005 were
subjected to the study. They included six H1N1 isolates
designated as A ⁄ Sw⁄ Ratchaburi ⁄ NIAH1481⁄ 00(Rat1481),
A ⁄Sw⁄ Ratchaburi ⁄ NIAH550⁄ 03(Rat550), A⁄ Sw⁄ Chonburi ⁄

(Chon9469), A⁄Sw⁄Chachonegsao⁄NIAH587⁄05(Chacho587)
and A ⁄ Sw⁄ Chonburi ⁄ NIAH589⁄ 05(Chon589), one H1N2
isolate designated as A ⁄ Sw⁄Saraburi ⁄ 13021⁄ 05(Sara13021)
and five H3N2 isolates designated as A ⁄ Sw⁄ Chachoengsao ⁄
03(Chacho03), A⁄ Sw⁄ Udon Thani ⁄ NIAH464⁄ 04(UT464),
A ⁄ Sw⁄Ratchaburi ⁄NIAH59 ⁄ 04(Rat59), A⁄ Sw⁄ Ratchaburi ⁄
NIAH874⁄ 05(Rat874) and A ⁄ Sw⁄ Nakhon Pathom⁄
NIAH586-1 ⁄ 05(NP586-1). Subtypes of these viruses were
identified by a standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
method with subtype-specific primers designed in this
study. Rat1481, Chon977, Chon9469, UT464 and Rat59
were isolated from pigs showing respiratory diseases with
coughing and ⁄ or sneezing. Low appetite and ⁄ or diarrhoea
were recorded in the pigs from which Rat1481 and
Chon9469 were isolated. Viruses were propagated in allan-
toic cavities of embryonated eggs.
DNA sequencing and analyses
The entire nucleotide sequences of the coding region were
determined for all eight genes of each virus. Viral RNA
was extracted from infectious allantoic fluid by using
MagNA Pure LC (Roche Diagnostics Corp., Basel, Swit-
zerland) as specified by the manufacturer. Reverse tran-
scription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was carried
out under standard conditions with specific primers
designed for this study. PCR products were purified from
agarose gels using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qia-
gen, Hilden, Germany). Purified products were subjected
to sequence reactions with gene-specific primers using Big
Dye terminator version 3Æ1 (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA, USA). Reactions were analysed by the ABI
model 3130 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, USA).
The sequences obtained in this study along with other
sequences from humans, pigs, birds and equines available
from GenBank were aligned, and the gaps were removed
using BioEdit software version 7Æ0Æ5Æ3.19
Phylogenetic trees
were constructed by the neighbour-joining method with
1000-times bootstrapping replicates.20
A total of 157 H1
genes including the Thai SIVs examined in this study, 281
H3, 186 N1, 294 N2, 128 PB2, 148 PB1, 145 M, 136 PA,
423 NS and 167 NP were analysed. The genes from Gen-
bank were collected from a variety of viruses isolated in
different years and from different subtypes. The lengths of
the nucleotide bases used were 1695bp for H1, 1611bp for
H3, 1197bp for N1, 1242bp for N2, 2235bp for PB2,
2154bp for PB1, 945bp for M, 2079bp for PA, 770bp for
NS and 1459bp for NP respectively. Regression analysis by
plotting the number of nucleotide substitutions against
the year of isolation were applied to the clusters Thai
SIVs belonging in all phylogenetic trees obtained with all
eight segments to estimate the year (with a 95% confi-
dence limit) when the strains within a particular cluster
derived from a common ancestor. The coefficient of
determination (R2
) was used as a measure of the reliabil-
ity of the estimation years. All of the sequences belonging
to one particular lineage for each segment were used for
regression analysis.

Results
Phylogenetic analysis of the H3 HA1 genes (Figure 1) and
the N2 NA genes (Data not shown) revealed the existence
of at least two distinct evolutional pathways in the human
virus lineage, designated as clusters Ha and Hb respectively,
amongst the Thai SIV isolates examined. Rat59 and Rat874
belonged to the cluster Ha whereas Chacho03, UT464 and
NP586-1 belonged to the cluster Hb (Table 1). The H3 Ha
Thai isolates were closely related to a human virus isolated
in Thailand in 1997 (Figure 1), suggesting that an ancestral
Ha strain may have acquired an H3 HA gene from a
human H3N2 strain circulating in the late 1990s. The H3
Hb Thai isolates were estimated to have derived from a
hypothetical common ancestor in 1976, which had acquired
an H3 HA gene from a human-like H3N2 swine strain cir-
culating in the early 1970s. Similar evolutional pattern was
observed in the N2 tree (data not shown). N2 gene of the
H1N2 isolate, Sara13021, which HA gene was of classical
swine origin, also belonged to the cluster Hb. The branch
points of common ancestors for those clusters of N2
genes were estimated to be 1998 for Ha and 1976 for Hb
respectively.
Two distinct clusters of H1 HA genes of the Thai SIVs
that were demonstrated in the classical swine lineage17
were
designated as Cla and Clb (Table 1). The Cla viruses
(Rat550 and Rat1480) and the rest Clb H1 viruses were
estimated to have derived from a hypothetical common
ancestor in 1981 with 95% confidence limits at 1979 and
1983 for Cla and in 1990 (95% confidence limit; 1988–
1991) for Clb.
PB2 (Figure 2) and N1 NA17
genes of all the Thai SIVs
formed a single cluster, designated as ALa within the avian-
like swine lineage (Table 1). Regression analysis estimated
that they were derived from a hypothetical common ances-
tor in 1983 (95% confidence limit; 1981–1986) for N1, and
1990 (95% confidence limit; 1988–1992) for PB2. The
topologies of the Thai SIVs in those phylogenetic trees
coincide with each other, providing supporting evidence
for the single introduction of those genes. The PB1 gene of
all the strains, except Rat59, showed a similar evolutional
pathway to those seen in N1 and PB2 genes. They were
derived from a hypothetical common ancestor in 1983
(95% confidence limit; 1980–1987). The PB1 gene of Rat59
was located in another cluster within the avian-like swine
lineage, sharing a common ancestor with European swine
viruses isolated between 1995 and 2004. Because of the low
bootstrap value (52%) at the node where Rat59 and the
other Thai isolates diverged, it was not clear whether or
not the PB1 gene of Rat59 had been introduced in another
occasion.
M (Figure 3) and PA (data not shown) genes of the Thai
isolates also belonged to the avian-like swine lineage. Fur-
thermore, at least two distinct evolutional pathways clearly
existed amongst the Thai isolates in both these genes. The
one that diverged earlier was considered to be an equiva-
lent of the ALa in the previous segments, and the other
was designated as ALb (Table 1). The years of divergence
of the ALa were estimated as 1990 (95% confidence limit;
1988–1992) for the M gene and 1987 (95% confidence
limit; 1985–1989) for the PA gene. Those for the ALb clus-
ter were estimated as 2000 (95% confidence limit; 1999–
2001) for the M gene and 1999 (95% confidence limit;
1998–1999) for the PA gene. The cluster ALa of the PA
gene was divided into two groups with a low bootstrap
value (21%) at the node of the hypothetical common
ancestor of that cluster. In addition, NP586-1 possessed M
gene of ALa and PA gene of ALb.
Nonstructural (NS) and nucleoprotein (NP) genes of the
Thai SIVs were contained in both the classical swine lineage
and the avian-like swine lineage (Figure 4 and Table 1).
Furthermore, two distinct clusters were found within the
classical swine NS lineage (Figure 4). One cluster, consist-
ing of exclusively H3 isolates (Rat874, Rat59 and Cha-
cho03), diverged from 1987 (95% confidence limit; 1986–
1988), was suggested to be the cluster Cla. The other clus-
ter including three H1 viruses (Sara13021, Chon977 and
Chon9496), which diverged from 1986 (95% confidence
limit; 1986–1987), appeared to be similar to that of the Clb
H1 HA gene. NP586-1, instead of Rat59, clustered with
Rat874 and Chacho03 within the classical swine lineage in
the NP tree (data not shown). The similarity of the topol-
ogy with the NS tree suggested that those three isolates
share a common genetic origin with the cluster Cla. How-
ever, the estimated year of origin of the NP Cla gene was
older (1963; 95% confidence limit; 1955–1971) than that
calculated for the NS and H1 Cla. This discrepancy was
probably due to the low R2
value for the estimation of the
NP gene (R2
= 0Æ488). All the NS genes of Thai isolates
belonging to the avian-like swine lineage were considered
to be the cluster ALa (Table 1). A common ancestor of the
ALa strains was estimated to have occurred in 1985 (95%
confidence limit; 1982–1988) for NS and 1989 (95% confi-
dence limit; 1988–1990) for NP.
Taken together, the existence of nine genotypes of the
SIVs was evident in the Thai pig populations within the
three subtypes examined (Table 1). All of the avian-like
swine segments possessed by the Thai SIVs were closely
related to the European avian-like swine lineage repre-
sented by A ⁄ Swine ⁄ Arnsberg ⁄ 6554⁄ 79(H1N1),21
but not
to those found in the North American swine viruses

indicat-
ing that the genetic resources introduced into the Thai
SIVs were mainly from Europe. This is consistent with the
fact that Thailand has imported breeding pigs from Europe
rather than North America since late 1980s.13
Discussion
The genetic diversity of SIVs as seen in other SIVs of the
world was evident in Thai pig population even from a
small number of viruses obtained between 2000 and 2005
(Table 1). The viruses containing genes from avian-like
swine viruses appeared to have some advantages for being
maintained in the pig population. All the Thai SIVs exam-
ined possessed PB2, PB1, PA and M genes of avian-like
swine lineages. Avian H1N1 viruses entered the pig popula-
tion in 1979 in Europe, and have gradually replaced classi-
cal swine H1N1 viruses, which circulated in Europe before
1979.21
Although human-like swine H3N2 and H1N2 with
human surface antigens emerged as a consequence of the
introduction of human viruses, avian-like swine genes
encoding internal proteins have been retained for nearly

30 years in the European pig population.4,22,23
There was
evidence that German swine H1N2 isolates in 2005 were
reassortants of avian-like swine H3N2 and H1N2.24
In
North America, the reassortant H3N2 SIVs containing
avian genes (PB2, PA) have spread more rapidly in the pig
population since 1998 than other reassortant H3N2 SIVs
without avian genes.25
Interestingly, the introduction of
classical swine H1N1 viruses into the former H3N2 SIVs
occurred and established the swine H1N2 lineage retaining
the PB2 and PA genes of avian origin.26
The complicated genetic diversity of SIVs in southern
China, where transmissions of avian viruses into pigs have
been reported over the last 30 years, is evident.27
In 1993,
Eurasian avian H1N1 virus entered the Hong Kong pig
population. It was an independent event from that
observed in the European pig population in 1979.28

Swine influenza virus in Thailand

H3N2 viruses that were closely related to those isolated
from the European pig population were isolated from
Hong Kong pigs.27
Prior to that event, an H3N2 virus with
similar gene set was isolated from a young child in 1999 in
Hong Kong.29
Additionally, H1N2 swine viruses containing
classical swine H1 and human-like N2 were isolated in
2004 in China.30
Our phylogenetic analysis indicated that
none of those avian-like and classical swine genes identified
in China were directly introduced into Thai pig population.
This observation correlates well with the fact that <30
breeding pigs were imported from China from 1986 to
2006 to Thailand.13
Our phylogenic analysis suggested two possibilities by
which Thai H1N1(N2) SIVs, which possess the HA gene of
classical swine origin and most of the other gene segments
of avian-like swine origin, emerged. One possibility is that
an avian-like swine H1N1 virus (ancestral ALa) was intro-
duced into the Thai pig population around 1990, where
two distinct classical swine viruses (Cla and Clb) had
already been circulating. By means of this introduction, all
of the gene segments except the HA of the Cla viruses were
replaced by genes of ancestral ALa virus. For the viruses
which retained the Clb HA gene, most of the segments
were also replaced by genes of ALa origin. The fact that
three strains (Chon9469, Chon977 and Sara13021) with the
Clb HA had retained NS genes of Clb origin supports this
possibility. Another possibility is that progenitor viruses
with a combination of genes of Clb and ALa origin estab-
lished elsewhere were introduced into the Thai pig popula-
tion where only viruses with genes of Cla origin had been
circulating. The coincidence of the divergent year of hypo-
thetical ancestral genes for Clb and ALa genes supports this
possibility. A weakness of the latter hypothesis is that there
has been no report of such a progenitor virus in the world,
although this does not completely exclude the possibility.
Also, the existence of the Clb NS genes in the Thai SIVs
discounts this possibility as well. In any case, the introduc-
tion of avian-like swine virus resulted in a variety of
genetic constellations within the H1N1 Thai SIVs.
This study also revealed that a human-like swine H3N2,
which may have been a provider of the Hb genes, was
introduced into the Thai pig population. The Hb genes of
the Thai SIVs shared a common ancestor with European
and Hong Kong H3 (H1) N2 SIVs which possess human-
like surface antigens and avian-like genes encoding internal
proteins. SIVs with an avian internal protein gene constel-
lation have been recognized in Europe for H3N2 and
H1N2 subtypes since the mid-1980s and -1990s respec-
tively.4,22
Although it is not clear when the progeny Hb
Thai viruses were introduced into the Thai pig population,
our estimation revealed that the H3 and N2 genes of an
ancestral Hb virus had diverged in 1976, indicating that the
virus did not contain any avian-like swine genes at that
time. Then, genes encoding internal proteins of the H3
(H1) N2 SIVs possessing surface antigens of Hb origin
were replaced with those of the H1N1 SIVs established in
Thailand, although it is not clear that the ancestral H3N2
viruses containing Hb origin were circulating amongst the
Thai pig population prior to the introduction of the ALa
genes from the data analysed by us.
The introduction of another human H3N2 virus (ances-
tral Ha virus) into the Thai pig populations was estimated
to have occurred around 1998. At that time, our analyses
indicated that H1N1 and H3N2 viruses containing a variety
of combination genes had already co-circulated in the Thai
pig population. Interspecies transmissions from pigs to
humans or vice versa have been described in many coun-
tries such as some European countries,31,32
China29
and
Thailand.18,33
Our analysis clearly demonstrated that the
Ha viruses acquired the HA gene not from swine but from
human virus (Figure 1). In contrast, Chutinimitku et al.
concluded that Rat874, used in both studies, derived from
an American or Asian SIV.18
This discrepancy was referable
to the data set used for the phylogenetic analysis. Chut-
inimitku et al., included only seven human H3 viruses and
13 American and Asian H3 SIVs for the analysis; in con-
trast, 109 human H3 viruses and 37 American and Asian
H3 SIVs were used in our study to improve reliability
of the analysis. Their work might not have adequate num-
ber of human epidemic H3 viruses to lead to a correct
conclusion.
The prevalence and pathogenicity of the Thai SIVs have
not been well known, and neither has the economic impact
caused by the SIVs in Thailand. The situation in Thailand
where several genotypes of SIVs could be co-circulating in
pig population certainly increases the chance of additional
evolutional events of the SIVs. Further surveillance would
elucidate whether one genotype highly adapted to the pigs
in each subtype gradually became dominant amongst vari-
ous genotypes of the Thai SIVs. It is unclear whether dif-
ferent gene constellations observed in this study could
affect the pathogenicity of the Thai SIVs. Van Reeth
observed no differences of virulence in pigs amongst three
subtypes (H1N1, H3N2 and H1N2) or strains.34
In addi-
tion, dual infections with SIVs and other pathogens such as
porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus
(PRRSV)35
and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae36
complicate
the pathogenicity of SIVs. We need further analyses of the
SIVs in Thailand to deepen our understanding regarding
not only the ecology but also the pathogenesis of the SIVs.
