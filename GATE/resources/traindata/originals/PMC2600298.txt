In 2004, canine influenza virus subtype H3N8 emerged
in greyhounds in the United States. Subsequent serologic
evidence indicated virus circulation in dog breeds other than
greyhounds, but the virus had not been isolated from affect-
ed animals. In 2005, we conducted virologic investigation of
7 nongreyhound dogs that died from respiratory disease in
Florida and isolated influenza subtype H3N8 virus. Antigenic
and genetic analysis of A/canine/Jacksonville/2005 (H3N8)
and A/canine/Miami/2005 (H3N8) found similarity to earlier
isolates from greyhounds, which indicates that canine influ-
enza viruses are not restricted to greyhounds. The hemag-
glutinin contained 5 conserved amino acid differences that
distinguish canine from equine lineages. The antigenic ho-
mogeneity of the canine viruses suggests that measurable
antigenic drift has not yet occurred. Continued surveillance
and antigenic analyses should monitor possible emergence
of antigenic variants of canine influenza virus.
Influenza A viruses (family Orthomyxoviridae) are known
to cause acute respiratory disease in humans, horses,
pigs, and domestic poultry (1,2). Influenza A virus subtype
H3N8 has recently emerged as a respiratory pathogen in
dogs, associated with outbreaks of acute respiratory disease
in racing greyhounds (3). The disease is caused by a novel
virus closely related to contemporary equine influenza A
virus subtype H3N8. These viruses share >96% nucleotide
sequence identity, which suggests direct transmission of
the entire virus from horses to dogs without reassortment
with other strains (3).
Canine influenza virus (CIV) was first identified in rac-
ing greyhounds in Florida in January 2004 and was later
associated with respiratory disease outbreaks in racing
greyhounds in 9 states from 2004 through 2006 (3,4). Most
affected greyhounds had clinical signs associated with
virus infection of the upper respiratory tract—cough for
10–30 days, nasal discharge, low-grade fever—followed
by recovery. However, some dogs died peracutely with ex-
tensive hemorrhage in the lungs, mediastinum, and pleural
cavity. Histologic examination showed tracheitis, bronchi-
tis, bronchiolitis, and suppurative bronchopneumonia asso-
ciated with extensive erosion of epithelial cells and infil-
tration with neutrophils. The isolation of 4 closely related
influenza A subtype H3N8 viruses from dogs that died in
different geographic locations over a 25-month period, to-
gether with substantial serologic evidence of widespread
infection among racing greyhounds in 9 states, suggested
sustained CIV circulation in this population by dog-to-dog
transmission (3,4).
The first evidence of CIV infection in dogs other than
greyhounds came from serologic testing of dogs with acute
respiratory disease in shelters, boarding kennels, and vet-
erinary clinics in Florida and New York in 2004 and 2005
(3). Since August 2005, a national syndromic serosurvey
for canine influenza has been conducted on >5,000 samples
collected from nongreyhound dogs with compatible clini-
cal signs (Cornell University College of Veterinary Medi-
cine, http://diaglab.vet.cornell.edu/issues/civ-stat.asp). As
of April 2008, seropositive dogs have been identified in 25
states and the District of Columbia.
In April and May 2005, an outbreak of respiratory dis-
ease occurred in dogs housed in a shelter facility in north-
eastern Florida (3). The outbreak involved at least 58 dogs,
ranging in age from 3 months to 9 years, and included pure-
bred dogs as well as mixed breeds; 6 were euthanized. In
May 2005, a respiratory disease outbreak occurred among
≈40 pet dogs at a veterinary clinic in southeastern Florida;
1 died. We performed molecular analyses on 2 influenza

Influenza A Virus (H3N8), Dogs
A subtype H3N8 viruses isolated from these 7 nongrey-
hound dogs that died and genetically and antigenically
compared them with influenza (H3N8) viruses from racing
greyhounds.
Materials and Methods
Specimen Collection
Postmortem examinations were performed on the 6
mixed-breed shelter dogs that died in April and May 2005
and on the 1 pet Yorkshire terrier that died in the veteri-
nary clinic in May 2005. Tissues were fixed in 10% neutral
buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin; 5-μm sections
were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histopatholog-
ic diagnosis. Unfixed tissues for virologic and molecular
analyses were stored at –80o
C.
RNA Extraction
Frozen lung tissues from each dog were thawed and ho-
mogenized in lysis buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol by
using a disposable tissue grinder (Kendall, Lifeline Medi-
cal Inc., Danbury, CT, USA). Total RNA was extracted by
using a commercial kit (RNeasy Mini Kit, QIAGEN Inc.,
Valencia, CA, USA) according to manufacturer’s instruc-
tions and eluted in a final volume of 60 μL of buffer. Total
RNA was also extracted from lung tissue collected from
specific-pathogen–free dogs without respiratory disease.
Real-Time Reverse Transcription–PCR
A single-step quantitative real-time reverse transcrip-
tion–PCR (RT-PCR) was performed on total RNA extract-
ed from the canine tissue samples by using the QuantiTect
Probe RT-PCR Kit containing ROX as a passive reference
dye (QIAGEN). Briefly, 2 primer-probe sets were used for
detection of influenza A sequences in each sample (Table
1). One primer-probe set was selective for canine influenza
subtype H3 gene sequences. The other primer-probe set tar-
geted a highly conserved region of the matrix (M) gene of
type A influenza virus. The sequence of the M probe con-
tained 3 locked nucleic acids. For each real-time RT-PCR,
5 μL of total RNA was added to a reaction mixture contain-
ing 12.5 μL of 2× QuantiTect Probe RT-PCR Master Mix,
0.25 μL of QuantiTech RT Mix (both QIAGEN), forward
and reverse primers (0.4 μmol/L final concentration for
each), probe (0.1 μmol/L final concentration), and RNase-
free water in a final volume of 25 μL. Real-time PCR for
eukaryotic 18S rRNA was performed by using commer-
cially available assay reagents (VIC/TAMRA; TaqMan,
Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), according to
manufacturer’s instructions for detection of endogenous
18S rRNA, as an internal control for RNA extraction from
the tissues.
Quantitative one-step real-time RT-PCR was per-
formed on the reaction mixtures in an Mx3000P QPCR
System (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). Cycling condi-
tions were a reverse transcription step at 50°C for 30 min,
an initial denaturation step at 95°C for 15 min to activate
the HotStarTaq DNA Polymerase (QIAGEN), and ampli-
fication for 40 cycles. Each amplification cycle included
denaturation at 94°C for 15 s, followed by annealing/exten-
sion at 60°C for 1 min. The FAM (emission wavelength
516 nm) and VIC (emission wavelength 555 nm) fluores-
cent signals were recorded at the end of each cycle. The
threshold cycle (Ct) was determined by setting the thresh-
old fluorescence at 1,000 for each individual experiment.
The Mx3000P version 2.0 software program (Stratagene)
was used for data acquisition and analysis. The results were
normalized by calculating H3 Ct or M Ct to 18S rRNA Ct
ratios for each sample. Samples were considered positive
for influenza A virus when the normalized H3 or M Ct ratio
was 3 U smaller than the normalized Ct ratio for lung tis-
sues from dogs without respiratory disease. The positive
control was amplified RNA that had been extracted from
A/canine/Florida/242/2003 (H3N8) virus grown in MDCK
cells (3).

ified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 0.5% bo-
vine serum albumin and gentamicin and ciprofloxacin. Sol-
id debris was removed by centrifugation, and supernatants

were inoculated onto MDCK cells cultured in DMEM sup-
plemented with 1 μg/mL TPCK (L-1-tosylamido-2-phenyl-
ethyl chloromethyl ketone)–treated trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich
Corp., St. Louis, MO, USA), 0.35% bovine serum albumin,
and antimicrobial drugs. Cells were grown in 25-cm2
flasks
at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2
.
The cultures were observed daily for morphologic changes
and harvested 3 days after inoculation. The harvested cul-
tures were clarified by centrifugation, and the supernatants
were inoculated onto fresh MDCK cells as described for
the initial inoculation; up to 3 additional passages were per-
formed for samples that did not show evidence of influenza
virus by hemagglutination or RT-PCR. Hemagglutination
activity in the clarified supernatants was determined by us-
ing 0.5% turkey red blood cells as described (5,6). RT-PCR
was performed as described below.
Inoculation of Embryonated Chicken Eggs
Frozen lung tissues were homogenized as described
above for inoculation of MDCK cells by using phosphate-
buffered saline instead of DMEM, and a volume of 0.2 mL
was inoculated into the allantoic sac of 10-day old embryo-
nated chicken eggs. After 48 h of incubation at 35°C, the
eggs were chilled at 4°C overnight before the allantoic fluid
was harvested. Hemagglutination activity in the clarified
allantoic fluid supernatants was determined by using 0.5%
turkey red blood cells as described (5,6). RT-PCR was per-
formed as described below. Harvested allantoic fluid sam-
ples lacking evidence of influenza virus were reinoculated
up to 2 more times in embryonated eggs and evaluated as
described.
RT-PCR, Nucleotide Sequencing, and Phylogenetic
Analyses
Virus RNA was extracted from MDCK culture super-
natant or allantoic fluid by using the QIAamp Viral RNA
Mini Kit (QIAGEN) according to manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. The virus RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA
by using the QIAGEN OneStep RT-PCR Kit according to
manufacturer’s instructions. PCR amplification of the cod-
ing region of the 8 influenza virus genes in the cDNA was
performed as described (7) by using universal gene-specific
primer sets (3). The resulting DNA amplicons were used
as templates for automated sequencing in the ABI PRISM
3100 automated DNA sequencer by using cycle sequencing
dye terminator chemistry (Applied Biosystems). Nucleotide
sequences were analyzed by using the Lasergene 6 Pack-
age (DNASTAR, Inc., Madison, WI, USA). The PHYLIP
Version 3.5 software program was used to estimate phy-
logenies and calculate bootstrap values from the nucle-
otide sequences (8). Phylogenetic trees were compared
with those generated by neighbor-joining analysis with the
Tamura-Nei model implemented in the MEGA3 program
(9) and confirmed by the PAUP 4.0 Beta program (Sinauer
Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA, USA). The complete ge-
nome sequences from the 2 new reported CIV isolates (A/
canine/Miami/2005 and A/canine/Jacksonville/2005) were
deposited in GenBank under accession nos. EU402407–
EU402408 and EU534193–EU534204.
Hemagglutination Inhibition Assay
Convalescent-phase immune serum samples were
obtained from horses and dogs naturally infected with in-
fluenza A virus (H3N8) in 2005. Antiserum from ferrets
infected with A/canine/Florida/43/2004 (H3N8) was pre-
pared as described (3). All serum samples were incubated
with receptor-destroying enzyme (DENKA SEIKEN Co.,
Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) (1 part serum: 3 parts receptor-destroy-
ing enzyme) for 16 h at 37°C before heat inactivation for 30
min at 56°C. Influenza A/canine/Jacksonville/2005 virus
(H3N8) was grown in MDCK cells for 72 h at 37°C in 5%
CO2
. Virus culture supernatants were harvested, clarified
by centrifugation, and stored at –80°C. All other canine
and equine viruses used in the hemagglutination inhibition
(HI) assay were grown in 10-day old embryonated chicken
eggs from which allantoic fluid was collected after 72 h and
stored at –80°C. The HI assay was performed as described
(6). On the basis of assay results from serum of uninfected
specific-pathogen–free dogs with HI titers <4, HI titers >32
were considered as evidence of previous exposure to CIV.
Results
Clinical Findings
Among the 58 affected shelter dogs, the most common
clinical signs were low-grade fever, purulent nasal dis-
charge, and cough for 10–21 days. Paired acute- and con-
valescent-phase serum samples were collected from 5 dogs
and tested for CIV-specific antibodies by using the HI assay.
All the dogs seroconverted to A/canine/Florida/43/2004
(H3N8) and had an increase in the geometric mean anti-
body titer (GMT) from 37 in the acute phase to 626 in the
convalescent phase. Single serum samples were collected
from another 18 dogs that had had clinical disease for at
least 7 days, and 17 (94%) were seropositive for A/canine/
Florida/43/2004 (H3N8); HI antibody titers ranged from 32
to 2,048 and GMT was 533. Pneumonia developed in at
least 10 dogs, of which 6 were euthanized and submitted
for postmortem examination. These 6 mixed-breed dogs
were 3 males and 3 females ranging in age from 4 months
to 3 years. The duration of clinical signs at the time of eu-
thanasia was 2–10 days.
Among the ≈40 affected pet dogs at the veterinary
clinic, the most common clinical signs were low-grade fe-
ver, purulent nasal discharge, and cough for 10–30 days.
Paired acute- and convalescent-phase serum samples were

Influenza A Virus (H3N8), Dogs
collected from 19 dogs and tested for CIV-specific anti-
bodies by using the HI assay. Of these, 11 (58%) dogs
seroconverted to A/canine/Florida/43/2004 (H3N8), and
the GMT increased from 9 in the acute phase to 329 in the
convalescent phase. Single serum samples were collected
from another 9 dogs that had had clinical disease for at
least 7 days, and 6 (67%) were seropositive for A/canine/
Florida/43/2004 (H3N8); HI antibody titers ranged from 64
to 512 and GMT was 228. Pneumonia developed in 3 dogs;
1, a 9-year-old male Yorkshire terrier, died 3 days after
onset of clinical signs and was submitted for postmortem
examination.
Postmortem examinations showed that all 7 dogs had
tracheitis and bronchitis with inflammatory changes that in-
volved submucosal glands. Tracheitis and bronchitis were
characterized by surface and glandular epithelial necrosis
and hyperplasia with infiltration by lymphocytes, neutro-
phils, and macrophages. Suppurative bronchopneumonia
was found in 2 of the shelter dogs and the pet dog; histo-
logically identified bacteria in the lesions indicated a bac-
terial contribution to the pneumonic lesions. None of the
dogs had intrathoracic or pulmonary hemorrhage.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Lung tissues from the 7 dogs were analyzed by quan-
titative real-time RT-PCR assays that detect the M gene
of influenza A and the H3 gene of CIV. The M and H3
genes were amplified from the lungs of all 7 dogs, which
confirmed the presence of CIV (Table 2). Lung tissue from
the specific-pathogen–free dogs did not show evidence of
amplification of influenza virus genes. MDCK cultures
were inoculated with these lung homogenates to identify
viable influenza virus. Pathologic cell damage was noted
in the MDCK cell monolayer on the third passage of the
lung homogenate from 1 of the shelter dogs that died after
3 days of pneumonia. Influenza A virus (later identified as
subtype H3N8) was recovered from the supernatant, and
the isolate was named A/canine/Jacksonville/2005. After
2 passages in embryonated chicken eggs, influenza A vi-
rus (later identified as subtype H3N8) was recovered from
the lung homogenate of the pet dog that also died of pneu-
monia 3 days after onset. This virus was named A/canine/
Miami/2005. These isolates provided virologic evidence of
CIV infection in nongreyhound dogs.
Genetic Analyses of the Canine Influenza A (H3N8)
Isolates
Sequence analyses of A/canine/Jacksonville/2005
and A/canine/Miami/2005 showed that their H3 gene nu-
cleotide sequences were 98% identical to those of the A/
canine/Florida/242/2003, A/canine/Florida/43/2004, A/ca-
nine/Texas/2004, and A/canine/Iowa/2005 isolates recov-
ered from the lungs of racing greyhounds that died of pneu-
monia during influenza outbreaks in 2004 and 2005 (3,4).
Phylogenetic comparisons of the H3 genes showed that
the A/canine/Jacksonville/2005 and A/canine/Miami/2005
viruses from nongreyhound dogs clustered with the grey-
hound isolates and contemporary equine isolates, forming a
distinct group from the older equine viruses isolated in the
early 1990s (Figure, panel A). Furthermore, the A/canine/
Jacksonville/2005, A/canine/Miami/2005, and A/canine/
Iowa/2005 isolates were more closely related to A/canine/
Texas/2004 than to either A/canine/Florida/43/2004 or A/
canine/Florida/242/2003. The H3 genes from the 2005 iso-
lates formed a subgroup that appeared to branch off from
the earlier 2003 and 2004 canine viruses with nucleotide
differences at 10 sites. Most nucleotide changes are silent,
as can be appreciated by the shorter branch lengths in the
phylogenetic tree constructed from deduced amino acid se-
quence data (Figure, panel B).
Amino Acid Sequence of the CIV H3 Hemagglutinin
To identify changes with possible functional signifi-
cance with regard to antigenicity or receptor binding, we

RESEARCH
canine isolates had 5 conserved amino acid substitutions
that differentiated them from contemporary equine influen-
za viruses (Table 3). These conserved substitutions (N54K,
N83S, W222L, I328T, and N483T) can be considered as a
signature of the circulating CIV H3 hemagglutinin. Phylo-
genetic comparisons of the mature H3 protein showed that
theA/canine/Jacksonville/2005,A/canine/Miami/2005,and
A/canine/Iowa/2005 viruses formed a subgroup with the A/
canine/Texas/2004 isolate (Figure, panel B). Three amino
acid changes (L118V, K261N, and G479E) differentiated
this subgroup from the earlier A/canine/Florida/43/2004
and A/canine/Florida/242/2003 isolates (Table 3). Final-
ly, A/canine/Jacksonville/2005 differed from A/canine/
Miami/2005 at a single amino acid, S107P.
Antigenic Analyses of the Canine
Influenza A (H3N8) Isolates
HI tests were performed by using an antigen panel of
previously circulating and contemporary equine influenza
viruses and the available CIVs as well as convalescent-
phase immune serum from horses and dogs naturally infect-
ed with influenza virus (H3N8) in 2005 (Table 4). An anti-
serum from ferrets infected with A/canine/Florida/43/2004
was also included in the analyses. HI antibody titers in
equine serum were 2-fold to 16-fold higher with contem-
porary equine viruses (1999–2003) than with older isolates
(1963–1992). The heterologous titers of equine serum to
canine viruses were generally similar to the homologous
values for the contemporary equine viruses. The canine se-
rum failed to substantially inhibit hemagglutination by the
older equine influenza viruses (1963–1992), but the anti-
body titers to contemporary equine isolates (1999–2003)
and the canine isolates were comparable. Similar results
were observed for serum from ferrets infected with CIV.
These patterns of inhibition demonstrated the antigenic
similarity between the CIVs and contemporary equine in-
fluenza viruses and were consistent with the phylogenetic
analyses. The antibody titers to the A/canine/Miami/2005
isolate in equine, canine, and ferret serum were similar to
those for the 2003 and 2004 canine isolates, which indi-
cates that the amino acid substitutions in the isolates did not
result in measurable antigenic drift. The antibody titers to
the A/canine/Jacksonville/2005 isolate were, in general, 2-
to 4-fold lower than those to A/canine/Florida/43/2004 and
other canine viruses, which suggests a potential antigenic
difference.
Discussion
The genetic and phylogenetic analyses of influenza A
subtype H3N8 viruses recovered from racing greyhounds
affected by respiratory disease outbreaks and fatal pneu-
monia in 2003 and 2004 have been described (3). These
greyhound influenza viruses were most homologous to
contemporary equine influenza A subtype H3N8 viruses
isolated from horses in 2002 and 2003. Although serologic
evidence of influenza virus infection in nongreyhound dogs
was reported (3), whether these infections were caused by
the same virus that infected the greyhound dogs is not
clear. The influenza subtype H3N8 viruses that we describe
in this report came from nongreyhound dogs involved in
fatal canine influenza outbreaks independent of any known
outbreaks in greyhounds.
Because viral hemagglutinin is a critical determinant
of the host specificity of influenza virus (10), we compared
the nucleic acid and deduced amino acid sequences for the
canine and equine H3 to identify residues that may be as-
sociated with efficient replication in different species or
dog breeds. The 5 conserved amino acid substitutions in all

the canine viruses differentiated them from contemporary
equine viruses. The substitution of lysine for asparagine at
position 54 maintains the positive charge of the residue and
is of unknown functional significance. Position 83 located
within antigenic site E of human H3 has been implicated
in antigenic drift (11). The substitution of serine for as-
paragine at position 83 in canine H3 maintains the polar
nature of the residue, but the functional significance in the
evolution of canine influenza is not immediately apparent.
The substitution of leucine for tryptophane at position 222
represents a nonconservative change adjacent to the sialic
acid–binding pocket, which suggests a potential modulator
function in adaptation of equine influenza virus to canine
sialic acid receptors. This leucine substitution has also been
reported in avian influenza subtype H4 infection of pigs
(12) and subtype H9 infection of humans (13). The strictly
conserved isoleucine at position 328 near the cleavage site
of the equine H3 hemagglutinin has been replaced by threo-
nine in all the canine isolates, which suggests the potential
importance of threonine for recognition of the hemagglu-
tinin cleavage site by canine proteases. The replacement
of asparagine with threonine at position 483 results in the
loss of a glycosylation site in the hemagglutinin 2 (HA2)
subunit. This glycosylation site is conserved in all other he-
magglutinin subtypes (14).
The phylogenetic tree of the canine and equine influ-
enza H3 genes shows that the canine and equine lineages
have diverged considerably. The hemagglutinin sequences
from the 2004 and 2005 equine influenza isolates belong
to the Florida sublineage and do not have the mutations
found in the canine strains. The H3 genes from the 2 Flori-
da 2005 canine isolates formed a clade with high bootstrap
support that included A/canine/Texas/2004 and A/canine/
Iowa/2005. Three amino acid substitutions in H3—L118V,
K261N, and G479E—differentiated this group from the
earlier isolates. Positions 118 and 261 are in the hemag-
glutinin 1 (HA1) subunit of canine H3; position 479 is in
the HA2 subunit. The HA1 subunit of human H3 contains
the antibody-binding sites where amino acid substitutions
occur at high frequency, presumably the result of escape

RESEARCH
from humoral immune responses (11,15,16). Although no
evidence supports high variability at positions 118 and 261,
neighboring positions 121 (antigenic site D) and 262 (anti-
genic site E) are sites of frequent positive selection in hu-
man H3 genes (11). The 2005 isolates from nongreyhound
dogs differed from each other by substitution of proline
for serine at position 107 in the HA1 subunit of A/canine/
Jacksonville/2005. Serine is conserved at position 107 in
all other equine and canine isolates except for A/equine/
Jilin/1/89, which has a threonine substitution (17). A/ca-
nine/Jacksonville/2005 has potentially significant antigenic
variation from the other canine isolates, which may be
partially related to the proline substitution at position 107.
However, no serologic evidence indicates that residue 107
modulates the antigenicity of human, porcine, or equine H3
hemagglutinins.
The HI results showed antigenic similarity between
the canine and contemporary equine influenza viruses and
were in agreement with the phylogenetic clustering of ca-
nine hemagglutinin sequences near the equine counterparts.
The amino acid and antigenic differences between canine
and equine hemagglutinin illustrate the ongoing process of
divergent evolution of the canine viruses from the ancestral
equine viruses. These differences also support the hypoth-
esis that CIV is a separate virus lineage, which is efficiently
maintained in the dog population by horizontal dog-to-dog
transmission.
With the introduction and sustained transmission of
influenza virus (H3N8) in dogs, the H3 hemagglutinin
became the most broadly distributed subtype in mamma-
lian species, including humans, swine, horses, and dogs.
Continued virologic and serologic surveillance will be im-
portant for monitoring the evolution of CIV and its health
effects in dogs as well as the possible transmission to other
species, including humans.
