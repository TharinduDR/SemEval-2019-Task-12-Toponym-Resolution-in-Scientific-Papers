We describe the first confirmed person-to-person trans-
mission of oseltamivir-resistant pandemic influenza
A(H1N1) 2009 virus that occurred in a hematology unit in
the United Kingdom. Eleven cases of (H1N1) 2009 virus
infection were identified, of which, ten were related as shown
by sequence analysis of the hemagglutinin and neuramini-
dase genes. H275Y analysis demonstrated that 8 of 10 case
patients had oseltamivir-resistant virus, with 4 of 8 case
patients infected by direct transmission of resistant virus.
Zanamivir should be considered as first-line therapy for in-
fluenza in patients with lymphopenic hematological con-
ditions and uptake of influenza vaccination encouraged to
further reduce the number of susceptible individuals.
Pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 virus emerged in Mexico
during April 2009 and has caused 2 successive pandemic waves
[1]. Analysis of the (H1N1) 2009 virus showed that it was
inherently resistant to the adamantane group of antivirals due to
a serine to asparagine mutation at amino acid 31 (S31N) in the
M2 ion channel [2]. Unlike the previously circulating seasonal
influenza A(H1N1) virus, which is fully resistant to oseltamivir
due to the presence of the H275Y mutation in the neuramini-
dase (NA) gene [3], the (H1N1) 2009 virus was shown to be
susceptible to both oseltamivir and zanamivir [2].
However, by October 2009, the sporadic emergence of
oseltamivir-resistant (OR) (H1N1) 2009 virus was reported in
immunocompromised patients who were receiving oseltamivir
therapy and in some individuals who had received oseltamivir
prophylaxis [4]. Fewer than 60 isolates of OR-(H1N1) 2009
had been reported to the World Health Organization by the
end of October 2009, and, of these, only 3 isolates had been
identified in the United Kingdom. There were no confirmed
reports of person-to-person transmission of OR-(H1N1) 2009
virus except for 1 incident involving 2 cases of resistant virus
in adolescents at a summer camp in the United States,
where evidence of spread was inconclusive [5]. We describe
the emergence of OR-(H1N1) 2009 virus during a nosocomial
outbreak on a hematology unit between October and
November 2009 with epidemiological and molecular evidence
of person-to-person transmission.
METHODS
Setting and patients. During October 2009, an outbreak of
OR-(H1N1) 2009 virus began in an adult hematology unit at the
University Hospital of Wales (UHW), Cardiff, United Kingdom.
The hematology unit provides hematology services to a local
population of 770, 000 and hematopoietic stem cell transplant
(HSCT) service for Wales (population 3 million). The unit
has a general hematology section for nontransplant recipients
(17 beds) and a dedicated HSCT section for patients
immediately after transplantation (10 beds). The HSCT section
has its own positive pressure, high efficiency particulate (HEPA)
filtered air supply. Elective admissions are for planned chemo-
therapy, transplantation, or central line insertion, whereas
emergency admissions are mostly associated with neutropenic
sepsis or chemotherapy complications.
Upper respiratory tract samples were collected from in-
patients presenting with an influenza-like illness (ILI), defined
by the Health Protection Agency (HPA) as a fever .38°
C with 2
or more of the following: cough, coryza, sore throat, headache,
myalgia, diarrhea, and from patients with an unresolving
pyrexia. Patients who received mechanical ventilation had

diagnostic bronchoalveolar lavages (BALs) performed. Samples
were obtained from case patients every 3–5 days after treatment
until 2 sequential test results were influenza A negative. Patients
who continued to have symptoms or who became symptomatic
were retested regardless of previous polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) results. All patients in contact with confirmed case pa-
tients were monitored for symptoms with a low threshold of
suspicion to ensure early sampling.
Retrospective review of admission records was undertaken by
the attending physician for each of the case patients to determine
clinical characteristics, date of admission, and length of time on
the unit (Table 1). Lymphocyte counts were recorded (reference
range, 1.0–4.0 109
cells/L) and compared for each of the case
patients during viral excretion and post viral clearance. Statis-
tical analysis was undertaken using the Mann-Whitney 2-tailed
nonparametric test.
Community surveillance and controls. Positive (H1N1)
2009 virus isolates from across Wales were tested for the H275Y
mutation by pyrosequencing to determine whether OR-(H1N1)
2009 virus was circulating in the wider community [6]. These
data were used to determine whether the emergence and
transmission of OR-(H1N1) 2009 virus in the UHW was an
isolated event in Wales.
Outbreak management. Early cases in the outbreak were
managed following standard outbreak interventions, including
isolating and cohorting of case patients and the reinforcement of
the use of personal protective equipment by health care workers
(HCWs) when working with symptomatic patients. HCWs on
the unit were offered both seasonal and pandemic influenza
vaccination.
Additional control measures were initiated when later cases of
OR-(H1N1) 2009 virus were identified. Elective admissions were
delayed, and the HSCT unit was used as an isolation facility.
Prophylaxis was stopped, and zanamivir was used as dual
therapy with oseltamivir. Patients who could not tolerate in-
haled zanamivir or who were receiving mechanical ventilation
were prescribed intravenous zanamivir on a named-patient
basis. Seasonal and pandemic vaccination was extended to in-
clude all patients and close contacts. Finally, screening of all
inpatients on the unit was undertaken to locate additional cases;
this was repeated 72 h later to show no further transmission
events had occurred.
Molecular diagnostics. Generic influenza A testing was
performed by real-time reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR)
targeting the matrix gene. To ensure sample quality and lack
of inhibition, an assay targeting human RNaseP was used;
a sample with a crossing threshold (ct) value of ,40 in the
influenza A assay as described in the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) protocol indicated a positive
test result for influenza A [7]. Influenza A–positive samples
were subtyped using a specific (H1N1) 2009 duplex real-time
RT-PCR assay designed by the Health Protection Agency
(HPA), Centre for Infections (CfI) (Colindale, London,
United Kingdom) [8].
Antiviral susceptibility testing. Positive samples from case
patients who did not clear virus despite treatment and from
cases whose first diagnosis occurred after evidence of viral re-
sistance was found on the unit were forwarded to the respiratory
virus unit at CfI for pyrosequencing analysis for the H275Y
mutation using (H1N1) 2009 specific primers. When virus
could be isolated in cell culture, phenotypic testing for oselta-
mivir and zanamivir was undertaken [6].
Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. Amplification and
sequencing of the complete coding regions of the haemagglutinin
(HA) and NA genes was performed directly from original
respiratory material with a 2-step RT-PCR using Superscript III
RT reverse transcriptase and Platinum Pfx polymerase
(Invitrogen Ltd), following manufacturer’s instructions. The HA
gene was amplified in 2 overlapping fragments (1.2–1.0 kb),
whereas NA was amplified in a single fragment (1.4 kb). Primers
are available upon request. Sequencing was performed on
a 48-capillary ABI 3730 Genetic Analyser (Applied Biosystems).
Raw sequencing data were edited and assembled using
Sequencher software (version 4.9).
Nucleotide sequences were aligned, trimmed to include
coding regions, and concatenated in the order HA-NA. Before
phylogenetic analysis, the triplet coding for position 275
associated with drug resistance was deleted from all NA
sequences. A maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic tree of
the concatenated HA-NA segments was inferred using PAUP
software package, version 4.0 (Swofford DL). The best-fit
model of nucleotide substitution was identified using
Modeltest [9] as the HKY851C model, with parameters esti-
mated from the empirical data. ML trees were determined
through an heuristic search. Bootstrap analysis was performed
through neighbor joining algorithm with 1000 replicates,
incorporating the ML substitution model previously
determined. Accession numbers and standard strain names are
provided in Suppl Table 1.
RESULTS
Case identification. From 29 October through 25 November
2009, 11 cases of (H1N1) 2009 virus were found in the
hematology unit (defined as an in-patient in the hematology
unit with a virological diagnosis of [H1N1] 2009). Epidemio-
logical analysis suggested an outbreak of (H1N1) 2009 virus had
occurred because the patients involved could be linked in time
and place. The outbreak affected male patients with underlying
hematological malignancy, and sequence analysis of the isolates
showed that 10 cases were virologically linked (Table 1 and
Figure 1). The probable index case of the outbreak (case 1) was
identified retrospectively on the basis of the HA and NA
sequencing of this virus.

The 11th case patient was admitted in late October 2009 but
was ruled out of the outbreak by sequence analysis. He was
symptomatic and had been admitted directly into isolation
where he was managed for his entire admission. No evidence of
onward transmission of his virus was found, suggesting appro-
priate infection control measures were being undertaken.
Overall, outbreak management was challenging because of the
difficulty in clinically diagnosing influenza in this patient cohort
using standard definitions of ILI. Mild symptoms and asymp-
tomatic illness were main features of this outbreak.
During the first 2 weeks of the outbreak, 6 HCWs on the unit
were absent from work with a multitude of different symptoms,
including lethargy, diarrhea, and coryza. No respiratory sam-
pling of HCWs had been undertaken because symptoms were
generally mild and nonspecific.
Antiviral susceptibility findings. Eight of the 10 outbreak
case patients had (H1N1) 2009 virus expressing the H275Y
mutation (Table 1). Where phenotypic testing was performed,
the presence of this mutation correlated with high-level oselta-
mivir resistance (200–600-fold increase in oseltamivir IC50).
Three of 8 case patients developed resistant virus while receiving
treatment. Pretreatment samples from these patients showed
sensitive virus by pyrosequencing and phenotypic assays analy-
sis. Cases 2 and 3 developed a mixed majority populations of
H275Y (Table 1), which did not alter on repeat testing. No other
case patients in the unit with OR-(H1N1) 2009 were shown to
have a similar mixed population. Case 6 had viral rebound with
OR-(H1N1) 2009 that was fully resistant to oseltamivir. Case 10
was on oseltamivir prophylaxis due to being in contact with 2
cases, and this possibly drove the emergence of OR-(H1N1)
2009 virus. No other patients had prior exposure to oseltamivir,
suggesting that person-to-person transmission of oseltamivir-
resistant virus had occurred.
Prophylaxis and treatment. Treatment and prophylaxis
used in the outbreak is summarized in Table 1. At the start of the
outbreak, all case patients were treated with 5 days of standard
dose oseltamivir (75 mg/BD). Subsequently, all case patients
were treated with 10 days double-dose oseltamivir (150 mg/
twice daily) and inhaled or intravenous zanamivir added if
resistant virus was suspected. Oseltamivir prophylaxis was used
sparingly and was stopped when it became apparent that the
outbreak involved an OR-(H1N1) 2009 virus.
Viral excretion and immune status. OR-(H1N1) 2009 vi-
rus was excreted by case patients for a mean of 17 days (range,
6–30 days). Prolonged positivity was seen in patients in whom
lymphocyte counts were ,0.5 3 109
cells/L, with a median of
0.27 3 109
cells/L compared with 0.65 3 109
cells/L when virus
was not detected (P ,0.001).
Sequence analysis results. Phylogenetic analysis of the
concatenated HA and NA genes from the outbreak influenza
viruses showed that they clustered together in a separate branch
from other (H1N1) 2009 viruses isolated in Wales and the

Transmission of Oseltamivir-Resistant A(H1N1) Virus d JID 2011:203 (1 January) d 21
United Kingdom during the same period (October – November
2009) (Figure 1). This cluster was characterized by a bootstrap
value of 94% and the presence of 4 nucleotide substitutions: 1
synonymous change in the HA gene (C273T), 2 synonymous
changes in the NA gene (G603A, T645C), and a nonsynonymous
mutation also in NA (G1384A) leading to an amino acid re-
placement (E462K). After deletion of codon position 275, all the
NA sequences from this cluster were shown to be identical.
Given the higher variable nature of the HA gene, a few addi-
tional single mutations had accumulated in all the viruses
sampled from case patients 9 (G751A), 7 (A330G), and 10
(G1035A). Also, posttreatment sample from case patient 2,
taken 5 days after the pretreatment sample, had accumulated
single substitution A716G. To further confirm the distinctive
feature of the 4 mutations characterizing the outbreak cluster,
a thorough search through all the sequences deposited in public
influenza sequencing databases (NCBI, GISAID) was carried
out, revealing that these mutations were present in ,1% of
global sequences, none of them from the United Kingdom, and
not concomitantly seen in any NA global sequence deposited to
date. This striking finding strongly supports our hypothesis of
transmission of OR viruses among the outbreak patients.

No evidence of the H275Y mutation was found in any other
(H1N1) 2009 virus isolate collected over the same period as
the outbreak from Wales. One further hematology patient (case
12, Figure 1) later developed a minority mixed population of
OR-(H1N1) 2009 virus on treatment, but this virus was shown
to be genetically distinct from the outbreak cluster.
DISCUSSION
This is the first confirmed outbreak to our knowledge of OR-
(H1N1) 2009 virus with person-to-person transmission, as
demonstrated by the presence of OR virus in pretreatment and
posttreatment samples of 2 patients. Subsequent genetic analysis
of the HA and NA genes proved that the same virus was involved
in the outbreak.
It occurred during the peak of the second wave of the (H1N1)
2009 pandemic in Wales, when 60% of community surveillance
samples tested positive for (H1N1) 2009 virus [10]. (H1N1)
2009 virus was introduced to the hematology unit from the
community with oseltamivir resistance being driven by treat-
ment in 2 lymphopenic patients with onward transmission
of OR-(H1N1) 2009 virus to other patients on the unit. Case
patients were all men, and their admissions on the ward
overlapped.
Treatment guidelines for hematology patients with (H1N1)
2009 virus infections were revised in light of this outbreak. Dual
treatment with oseltamivir and zanamivir was used when re-
sistant virus was suspected or confirmed. Although all of the
cases recovered from influenza using this approach, recent data
suggest there is possibly no synergy to be gained from this ap-
proach [11] Zanamivir alone therefore would be preferable as a
frontline treatment in particularly high-risk groups. Prophylaxis
should be used with caution in patients with lymphopenia, be-
cause they may have asymptomatic infection with prolonged
viral excretion; both of which are significant factors in the
emergence of resistance [12]. Viral clearance in this outbreak
was associated with immune reconstitution, supporting pre-
vious findings [12, 13]. Case 6 transiently had a lymphocyte
count above 0.5 3 109
cells/L and became PCR negative, sug-
gesting that a combination of antivirals and a degree of immune
reconstitution temporarily suppressed viral replication. Viral
rebound may have occurred because of the presence of a mi-
nority population of OR-(H1N1) 2009 virus that replicated
despite the presence of oseltamivir [6]. Drug resistance should
therefore always be considered in any immunosuppressed
patient who does not clear virus.
Transmission of infection on hematology units might be re-
duced by protective isolation of neutropenic patients using
single cubicles, but this approach is controversial. Although
some studies show reduced infection rates, none have been able
to demonstrate reduced mortality [14]. Patients treated in iso-
lation were shown to have a significant psychological burden,
including increased levels of insomnia and depression [15]. An
alternative to isolation is increasing vigilance for the in-
troduction of respiratory infections into areas where immuno-
compromised patients are cared for, together with good
infection control procedures to prevent transmission events.
There were no deaths and only limited morbidity associated
with(H1N1)2009infectionregardlessofoseltamivirsusceptibility
in this outbreak. Despite the ease of transmission of the OR-
(H1N1)2009virusontheunit,themildsymptomsassociatedwith
this outbreak led to difficulties in determining when a case patient
acquired their infection, making the production of a meaningful
outbreak curve impossible. Because screening of the unit did not
occur until late into the outbreak, it is possible that an individual
with mild symptoms or asymptomatic shedding played a role in
the continued transmission of the OR-(H1N1) 2009 virus.
Pandemic influenza vaccine was available in the United
Kingdom in late October 2009; when the outbreak was identi-
fied, vaccination of hematology patients, their families, and
hospital staff was undertaken. Vaccination against influenza
remains the best way of preventing infection in these patients,
and therefore, vaccine uptake must be strongly encouraged to
reduce the pool of susceptible individuals prior to the start of
each influenza season.
