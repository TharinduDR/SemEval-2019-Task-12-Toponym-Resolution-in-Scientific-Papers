A novel hantavirus, first detected in Siberian lemmings (Lemmus sibiricus) collected near the Topografov
River in the Taymyr Peninsula, Siberia (A. Plyusnin et al., Lancet 347:1835–1836, 1996), was isolated in Vero
E6 cells and in laboratory-bred Norwegian lemmings (Lemmus lemmus). The virus, named Topografov virus
(TOP), was most closely related to Khabarovsk virus (KBR) and Puumala viruses (PUU). In a cross focus
reduction neutralization test, anti-TOP Lemmus antisera showed titers at least fourfold higher with TOP than
with other hantaviruses; however, a rabbit anti-KBR antiserum neutralized TOP and KBR at the same titer.
The TOP M segment showed 77% nucleotide and 88% amino acid identity with KBR and 76% nucleotide and
82% amino acid identity with PUU. However, the homology between TOP and the KBR S segment was dis-
proportionately higher: 88% at the nucleotide level and 96% at the amino acid level. The 3* noncoding regions
of KBR and the TOP S and M segments were alignable except for 113- and 58-nucleotide deletions in KBR. The
phylogenetic relationships of TOP, KBR, and PUU and their respective rodent carriers suggest that an excep-
tional host switch took place during the evolution of these viruses; while TOP and KBR are monophyletic, the
respective rodent host species are only distantly related.
The members of the genus Hantavirus, family Bunyaviridae,
are each primarily carried by a different, specific rodent host
species. The phylogeny of the hantaviruses has been shown to
mirror the relatedness of their respective carrier species, sug-
gesting coevolution of the viruses with their hosts (35). The
permanent transmission of hantavirus to another rodent spe-
cies has been documented only once (27); permanent trans-
mission between different rodent genera has never been doc-
umented. However, temporary spillover to secondary hosts,
such as other rodent species or humans, where hantaviruses
can cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and hanta-
virus pulmonary syndrome, may occur (for a review, see ref-
erences 16, 23, 35, and 40). In northern Europe, the predom-
inant pathogenic hantavirus is Puumala virus (PUU), carried
by the bank vole Clethrionomys glareolus. Other known hanta-
virus carrier rodents on the Eurasian continent include species
of Rattus, Apodemus, and Microtus.
Lemmings are arvicoline rodents inhabiting the Arctic tun-
dra. Lemmus lemmus of Fennoscandia (the area comprising
Norway, Sweden, Finland, and adjacent areas of Russia) is
closely related to the western type Lemmus sibiricus, whose
distribution extends to the Taymyr Peninsula in Russia to the
east (Fig. 1). Together, these two are genetically more distantly
related to the central type of L. sibiricus (found from the Lena
to the Kolyma Rivers) and to the eastern type (found east of
the Kolyma River and in Alaska), also known as Lemmus
trimucronatus) (8). L. lemmus is well known for its drastic
population fluctuations and mass migrations (12). The spring
migration of lemmings during one peak population year, 1942,
coincided with an outbreak of more than 1,000 cases of a mild
hemorrhagic fever-like illness among Finnish and German
troops stationed in Salla, Finland (14, 44).
The presence of hantaviral antigen in lemmings in Arctic
Siberia has been previously reported (28). To screen for a
hantavirus in lemmings, we obtained lemming liver samples
that were collected in several locations along the Siberian coast
during the Swedish-Russian Tundra Ecology Expedition of
1994 (Fig. 1).
Our aim was to isolate the hantavirus present in this evo-
lutionarily distinct arvicoline rodent in cell culture and to
characterize it genetically and antigenically. When this was
achieved, the isolated virus was found to have striking sim-
ilarities to another hantavirus, Khabarovsk virus (KBR), iso-
lated from an evolutionarily distant arvicoline rodent species,
Microtus fortis, in the Russian far east (7, 13). This led us to
further compare the phylogenetic relationships between the
hantavirus genomes from the carrier rodents and their mito-
chondrial DNA sequences.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Viruses. All hantavirus strains were propagated in a biosafety level 3 labora-
tory in Vero E6 cells cultivated in Eagle’s minimal essential medium supple-
mented with 2% fetal calf serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomy-
cin. The following hantavirus strains were used: Hantaan/76-118 (HTN) (17),
Puumala/Sotkamo (PUU) (3, 41), Prospect Hill/PH-1 (PH) (18), KBR/MF-43
(KBR) (7, 13), Tula/M02V (TUL) (48), and Sin Nombre/CC107 (SN) (39).
Collection and screening of rodent samples. The lemming liver samples from
Siberia were collected during the Swedish-Russian Tundra Ecology Expedition
of 1994 (10). Altogether, 231 samples from 12 localities (Fig. 1) were screened by
immunoblotting for hantavirus N antigen with a rabbit antiserum raised against
recombinant PUU N antigen (anti-GST-PUU-N2/3) (47).
Virus isolation and production of antisera. Isolation of hantavirus in Vero E6
cells was performed by inoculating diluted, homogenized lemming liver tissue

(stored for 2 years at 270°C) into Vero E6 cells and passaging the cells by
trypsinization and the addition of fresh cells (at a 1 to 3 ratio to the rest of the
cells) every 3 weeks as described previously (48). The cells were checked by
immunofluorescence assay (IFA) with monoclonal antibody (MAb) 1C12 (21)
for hantavirus antigen. The isolated virus was purified by a sucrose gradient as
described before (48).
The same liver samples were inoculated subcutaneously and intranasally into
laboratory-bred hantavirus antibody-negative L. lemmus lemmings from Finse,
Norway. The inoculated lemmings were then sacrificed 30 days later and checked
for anti-PUU antibodies by IFA and for N antigen by immunoblotting with a
rabbit antiserum as described above. The generation of polyclonal antisera for a
focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT) was achieved by the intranasal inoc-
ulation of New Zealand White rabbits as described previously (30). In addition,
the sera of experimentally infected L. lemmus lemmings were used.
Reverse transcription-PCR, cloning, and sequencing of viral sequences. RNA
extraction (5) was done similarly for infected Vero E6 cell cultures and rodent
samples. The entire S segment was amplified by using one primer and was cloned
as described before (32, 34). The M segment was amplified and cloned in three
parts; for the L segment (nucleotides [nt] 181 to 514), a pair of nested primers
was used (sequences are available upon request). For this study, the KBR (13)
total M segment sequence was also completed, and a partial L segment sequence
of KBR and PH was determined. The PCR amplicons were separated in agarose
gels and purified with the QIAquick kit (Qiagen GmbH). Direct sequencing was
performed with an ABI Prism dye terminator sequencing kit (Perkin-Elmer
Applied Biosystems Division [PE/ABI], Foster City, Calif.) according to the man-
ufacturer’s instructions, and reactions were run on an ABI 373 A sequencer
(PE/ABI). Cloning of the PCR products was done with a PGEM-T cloning kit
(Promega). Plasmids were purified with either the Wizard Mini-preps kit (Pro-
mega) or the QIAprep kit (Qiagen GmbH) and sequenced either with Seque-
nase, version 2.0 (United States Biochemicals), or automatically. In the latter
case, sequencing was performed with either an ABI Prism dye terminator or ABI
Prism M13F and M13R dye primer sequencing kit (PE/ABI).
Rodent sequences. Mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (cyt b) DNA sequences
were either downloaded from GenBank or generated in the laboratory. The
rodent data are part of a larger study on the evolution of arvicoline genera and
species of Microtus. They will be published in complete form elsewhere (6).
Samples were derived from different rodent species from various collections as
follows (sample number in parentheses). (i) Apodemus flavicollis (AF 3326),
Clethrionomys glareolus (AF 3133), Clethrionomys rufocanus (AF 3783), L. sibiri-
cus (AF 15478), L. trimucronatus (AF 4077), Microtus californicus (AF 15891),
Microtus pennsylvanicus (AF 2511), and Peromyscus maniculatus (AF 17750)
samples were from the Alaska Frozen Tissue Collection, University of Alaska
Museum, Fairbanks; (ii) a Reithrodontomys megalotis sample (812 bases, UAM
38139 [skin]) was from the University of Alaska Museum; and (iii) an M. fortis
sample (MVZ 1524) was from the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, University of
California, Berkeley. DNA was extracted from samples of heart or skin via a
modified salt method (25). Symmetric PCR (37) was used to amplify portions of
the cyt b gene (Mus mitochondrial DNA, base pairs [bp] 14139 to 15282) (1) with
standard cyt b primers (6, 42) and PCR protocols. Sequences for both strands
were determined on an ABI 373a stretch DNA sequencer with a Prism dye
terminator kit (Fst-RR, 402119; Perkin-Elmer).
Phylogenetic analyses. The PHYLIP program package (9) was used to make
200 bootstrap replicates of the sequence data (Seqboot). Distance matrices were
calculated by using Kimura’s two-parameter model (Dnadist) and analyzed by
the Fitch-Margoliash tree-fitting algorithm (Fitch). The bootstrap support per-
centages of particular branching points were calculated from these trees (Con-
sense). For comparison, existing sequence data were obtained from GenBank.

SEO/80-39 (X56492), and HTN/76-118 (X55901).
The rodent cyt b sequences were aligned by eye. The following rodent cyt-b
sequences were downloaded from GenBank (full cyt b sequence if not otherwise
indicated): Calomys lepidus (801 bases, U03544), Microtus arvalis (U54488),
Oligoryzomys microtis (801 bases, U58381), Oryzomys palustris (401 bases,
L37388), Peromyscus leucopus (321 bases, X89790), and Rattus rattus (X14848).
By using the PHYLIP program package (9), Kimura two-parameter distances
(Dnadist) were analyzed by the Fitch-Margoliash tree-fitting algorithm (Fitch).
Bootstrap percentages for 250 iterations were calculated (Seqboot), and Tree-
Map software (31) was used to construct a “tanglegram” of murid rodents and
associated hantaviruses.
MAbs and IFA. A panel of MAbs (21, 24) and recombinant Fab fragments (38)
was used in a standard IFA on acetone-fixed, hantavirus-infected Vero E6 cells
(21).
FRNT. Endpoint titers of neutralizing antibodies were determined by FRNT
(30). Dilutions of sera were mixed with an equal volume containing 30 to 70
focus-forming units of virus/100 ml. The mixture was incubated for 1 h and
subsequently inoculated onto confluent Vero E6 cell monolayers in six-well
plates. After adsorption for 1 h, the wells were overlaid with a mixture of agarose
and basal Eagle’s medium. Plates were incubated for 9 (HTN), 10 (KBR), or 12
(PUU, PH, Topografov virus [TOP], TUL, and DOB) days. Virus-infected cells
were detected with hantavirus-specific polyclonal antisera, followed by peroxi-

dase-labeled goat antibodies and a substrate. An 80% reduction in the number
of foci was the criterion for virus neutralization titers.
HI test. A goose erythrocyte hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test was per-
formed essentially as described previously (4). PUU-, TOP-, and KBR-infected
Vero E6 cell culture supernatants (for TUL, a sucrose gradient peak fraction)
treated with Tween 20-ether (1:1 ratio) were used as hemagglutination antigens
with 3 hemagglutination units of antigen per well.

quences are deposited with accession no. AJ011648 and AJ011650, respectively;

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Isolation of TOP. Altogether, 231 liver samples from Sibe-
rian lemmings (L. sibiricus), collected in 12 localities during the
Swedish-Russian Tundra Ecology Expedition of summer 1994,
were screened for hantavirus antigen by immunoblotting; 6
specimens were positive. These animals were among 61 col-
lected from two localities (no. 8 and 10) on the Taymyr Pen-
insula (Fig. 1) (33).
Each positive sample was injected into Norwegian lemmings
(L. lemmus) originating from Finse, Norway. The virus was
successfully passaged in (four of six) laboratory lemmings,
with the presence of antigen in the lungs demonstrated by
immunoblotting (four of six) and/or with the development of
anti-PUU antibodies demonstrated by IFA (three of six). The
lung tissues of antigen-positive lemmings were used for RNA
isolation, followed by reverse transcription and nested PCR.
Initially, amplicons (354 bp in length) from the S genomic
segment from two specimens were prepared. Subsequent se-
quencing revealed a previously unknown hantavirus geno-
type, named TOP according to its geographic origin, the area
around the Topografov River (33) (locality 10) (Fig. 1). Iden-
tical sequences were also derived from the original lemming
samples.
We also applied the same liver samples from wild lemmings
onto Vero E6 cells without a prior passage in laboratory lem-
mings. After 9 weeks and two cell passages, four of six isola-
tions were clearly positive for hantavirus N antigen, including
isolates from individual samples from the two different loca-
tions. One of the isolates, designated TOP/Ls136V5/94 and
originating from locality 10, was selected as the reference
strain. The virus supernatant could be passaged several times
in Vero E6 cells, and the virus was further purified by sucrose
gradient ultracentrifugation; the viral peak was recovered at
42% (wt/vol) sucrose, where hantavirus-like particles could be
distinguished by electron microscopy. TOP G1 migrated more
slowly in a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel than did
PUU G1, whereas TOP G2 and N showed apparent molecular
weights similar to those of PUU G2 and N (data not shown).
Antigenic properties. When studied with a panel of nucleo-
capsid protein-specific MAbs by IFA, TOP was found to be
antigenically most closely related to KBR (Table 1). Two
MAbs could be used to distinguish PUU from TOP and KBR.
The nucleocapsid proteins of TOP and KBR differed only in
reactivity to one anti-PUU MAb, 3H9, the epitope of which
has been mapped to the most variable part of N, amino acids
(aa) 251 to 260 (20, 22). The reactivity of 3H9 with TOP was
very weak: aa 252 to 257 for TOP N were KPGAPA instead of
KPGTPA in PUU and KBR, which most probably explains the
different reactivity. We noted also that native SN was detected
by two MAbs (1C8 and 3C11) that were not reactive with
recombinant SN nucleocapsid protein (24) (Table 1).
In a cross-FRNT, TOP was distinguishable from all other
hantaviruses with at least a two-way fourfold titer difference
(Table 2) except for a one-way titer difference for KBR, as the
anti-KBR rabbit antiserum neutralized KBR and TOP with the
same titer (1:1,280). A similar pattern was obtained in an HI
test.
Genetic properties. Sequencing of TOP S showed that the S
segment consists of 1,953 nt and codes for a nucleocapsid
protein of 433 aa and a putative nonstructural protein, NSs, of
90 aa. The sequence was most closely related to that of KBR
(82% nucleotide and 96% amino acid identity for the S seg-
ment) and PUU (77% nucleotide and 87% amino acid iden-
tity) (Table 3). The 39 noncoding region (according to the
messenger sense) of TOP S was alignable with that of KBR,
showing 77% nucleotide homology. However, the KBR S non-
coding region had a deletion of 113 nt compared to the TOP S
sequence.
The M segment consisted of 3,735 nt and coded for a G1-G2
precursor of 1,142 aa. The M segment showed considerably

more variation than the S segment, but the pattern of related-
ness to different hantaviruses was the same, showing 77% nu-
cleotide and 88% amino acid identity between TOP and KBR
and 76% nucleotide and 83% amino acid identity between
TOP and PUU (Table 3). Similarly to the S segment, a deletion
of 55 nt was found in the 39 noncoding region of KBR com-
pared to TOP. The putative Asn-linked glycosylation sites in
G1 and G2 were identical among TOP, PUU/Sotkamo, and
KBR. The L segment sequence was analyzed from nt 181 to
514. This region showed 81% nucleotide and 90% amino acid
homology to the KBR L segment. Although the M segment
tends to be the most variable of the hantavirus genome seg-
ments, the difference between the M and S segment amino acid
homologies for TOP and KBR (88 and 96%, respectively) is
exceptionally high. While this could be explained by reassort-
ment, no sequence data currently available on related viruses
support this hypothesis. The discordant homologies for the two
genome segments could mean that either (i) a recombinant
virus would have had better capabilities for a permanent host
switch or (ii) after the host switch, an evolutionary pressure in
a new host has generated more amino acid changes in the
glycoproteins than in the nucleocapsid protein.
TOP strain variation. TOP strains derived from the two
localities (no. 8 and 10 [Fig. 1]) were analyzed by reverse
transcription-PCR of a 354-nt fragment (nt 4 to 357) of the S

segment and subsequent sequencing. Interestingly, in locality
8, two lineages showing 7.5% nucleotide divergence cocircu-
lated. The other lineage (represented by strain 29) was sur-
prisingly closely related (1% nucleotide divergence) to the
TOP strains from locality 10 (no. 136 and 137). As localities 8
and 10 are about 600 km apart, the lack of clear geographic
clustering of genetic variants might reflect the dispersal capac-
ity of lemmings (8).
Phylogenetic relationships of hantaviruses and respective
rodent carriers. In the phylogenetic trees created for all three
genome segments (Fig. 2), TOP was monophyletic with KBR.
Furthermore, the TOP-KBR clade had a common origin with
the PUU viruses with a high branching probability. A compar-
ison of the phylogenetic trees of hantaviruses and their known
carriers shows (Fig. 3) that coevolution is a general rule (re-
sulting in similar branching order for the rodents and their
respective hantaviruses). Also, a heuristic search for the best
match between trees (31) suggested nine cospeciations. How-
ever, an evident host switch has occurred for the ancestor of
KBR from a PUU lineage, as KBR does not group with other
Microtus-borne viruses but instead has a common node of
origin, firstly with TOP and secondly with PUU, which are
carried by Lemmus and Clethrionomys, respectively. Another
clear discrepancy in the arvicoline rodent phylogeny is that the
branching of TOP from the PUU lineage is distal to the main
Microtus-derived virus cluster (PH, TUL, and ILV), although
the Clethrionomys and Microtus species are more closely re-
lated to each other and have a common evolutionary origin
(83% bootstrap support) compared to the more ancestral Lem-
mus (Fig. 3) (26). In fact, the branching position of the com-

mon ancestor of KBR and TOP is not in line with the phylog-
eny with either of the host rodents.
A hypothetical scenario for the host switch events might be
that the ancestor of Clethrionomys, clearly after the divergence
of the rapidly radiating Microtus species approximately 1.5
million years ago (26), was the donor of an ancestral virus
which became the common ancestor of both TOP and KBR.
This ancestral virus branch is separate from all PUU viruses
from Japan to Belgium, which have a distinct, common node of
origin. It is not certain if the ancestral virus was first transmit-
ted to Lemmus; the long deletions in the S and M segment 39
noncoding regions of KBR compared to TOP suggest that
TOP could represent a more ancestral virus than KBR. How-
ever, the knowledge of the genetic diversity and geographical
distribution of TOP is limited. We screened more than 400 L.
lemmus samples from Fennoscandia and a total of 177 lem-
mings from other locations in the Russian Arctic (Fig. 1) with-
out finding evidence of hantavirus antigen.
The geographic distributions of M. fortis and L. sibiricus do
not overlap today (43), meaning that both species should per-
manently carry their respective viruses; i.e., TOP and KBR do
not represent spillover viruses. During the more than 3 million
years that the Clethrionomys-Microtus branch evolved from the
common ancestor to Lemmus (36), the geographic ranges of
the host rodent species have probably varied considerably, and
the host switch(es) may have taken place, for example, in the
southern ranges frequented by the central L. sibiricus group.
Recent data on SN-like viruses of P. leucopus and P. mani-
culatus have shown that horizontal transmission between close-
ly related species can occur (27). Another likely hantavirus
host transfer (or possibly duplication) is suggested by the ex-
istence of Dobrava virus in both A. flavicollis and Apodemus
agrarius in Europe (28a), while the latter carries the distinct
Hantaan virus in far eastern Asia. Data on South American
hantaviruses and their host species, both of which have radi-
ated rapidly (15, 19), are not in full agreement with the coevo-
lution in rodent host species (see, e.g., the Laguna Negra virus,
[Fig. 3]) (29). In the cases of TOP and KBR, while the se-
quence of events remains unclear, these are the first clear
indications that a hantavirus host switch event can indeed
occur among more distantly related rodent species and even
between different rodent genera. Yet a host switch seems to be
a rare event, and cospeciation remains the rule. An analogy to
the phylogeny of rodent carriers can be drawn, for example,
with Arenaviridae (2) and even with some ectoparasites such as
lice (11), which show cospeciation with rodents and occasional
host switches, resulting in new adaptive peaks.
The taxonomic relationships of TOP and KBR are of special
interest. If our hypothesis about a horizontal transmission, or
host switch, during evolution of these viruses is correct, it
seems logical to assume that TOP and KBR are still radiating
from each other. Ongoing radiation by the two viruses could be
reflected by different degrees of diversity for the M and S
segments of TOP and KBR. Nevertheless, based on an analysis
of the combination of properties of TOP and KBR, we believe
that TOP and KBR fulfill the criteria for demarcation (45) and
should thus be considered distinct virus species. The strongest
argument for such a conclusion is that TOP and KBR have
clearly distinct host species in which they are constantly main-
tained. The identification of additional sequences from related
hantaviruses might shed light on the origin and relatedness of
these viruses. For example, another hantavirus identified from
M. fortis in the Russian far east, Vladivostok, seems at least as
divergent from KBR as TOP is (15a).
Is TOP a pathogen? We screened serum samples of World
War II veterans who had been stationed in Salla, Finland,
during the putative lemming-borne hantavirus outbreak of
1942 for hantavirus antibodies. While hantavirus antibodies
were found in one-third of the samples, no difference in reac-
tivity or antibody titers could be demonstrated between TOP,
PUU, and KBR antigens by FRNT or with truncated recom-
binant antigens in an enzyme immunoassay (data not shown).
However, similar results were also found in samples from peo-
ple with decades-old PUU immunity who had no association
with lemmings. It remains to be determined whether a hanta-
virus actually circulates in lemmings in Fennoscandia and if
TOP can be transmitted to humans. However, it is possible that
the outbreak of 1942 was caused by a hantavirus carried by
lemmings, since (i) the clinical symptoms mimicked those later
described for nephropathia epidemica, including high fever,
acute renal failure, and, occasionally, myopia (14, 44); (ii) the
year 1942 coincided with a mass migration of lemmings in the
region; and (iii) the incidence of the disease peaked in May
and June 1942, which coincides with the lemming spring mi-
gration and contrasts with the epidemiology of the Clethriono-
mys-borne disease, which normally peaks in November or De-
cember in Fennoscandia (46). As the population density of
lemmings fluctuates strongly, it may be that only during occa-
sional peak years do rodent densities reach the threshold nec-
essary for the virus to spread efficiently.
