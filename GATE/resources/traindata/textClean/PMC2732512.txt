Southern African West Nile
Virus Isolates

Phylogenetic relationships were examined for 29 southern African West Nile virus (formal name West Nile
virus [WNV]) isolates from various sources in four countries from 1958 to 2001. In addition sequence data
were retrieved from GenBank for another 23 WNV isolates and Kunjin and Japanese encephalitis viruses.
All isolates belonged to two lineages. Lineage 1 isolates were from central and North Africa, Europe,
Israel, and North America; lineage 2 isolates were from central and southern Africa and Madagascar. No
strict correlation existed between grouping and source of virus isolate, pathogenicity, geographic distribu-
tion, or year of isolation. Some southern African isolates have been associated with encephalitis in a
human, a horse, and a dog and with fatal hepatitis in a human and death of an ostrich chick.
est Nile virus (formal name West Nile virus [WNV]) is a
mosquito-borne member of the Flaviviridae family
(genus Flavivirus), which was originally isolated from the
blood of a febrile patient in Uganda in 1937 (1). The virus is
widely distributed in Africa, Asia, and Europe and was
recently spread to the Western Hemisphere, where its presence
was recognized in the northeastern United States in 1999 (2,3).
After the initial isolation of the virus, sporadic cases and
outbreaks of febrile disease were recorded in humans in
Africa, the Near East, and Asia; the largest outbreaks occurred
in Israel in 1950–1954 and 1957 and in South Africa in 1974
(4,5). Meningoencephalitis was first observed in elderly
patients in Israel in 1957 and subsequently observed as a com-
plication in young children in India (6,7). In 1962, the isola-
tion of WNV from a horse with encephalitis was reported in
Egypt; from 1962 through 1966, meningoencephalitis
occurred in both humans and horses in a series of outbreaks in
southern France (8,9). In 1983, four cases of hepatitis, two
fatal, were attributed to WNV infection in the Central African
Republic (CAR), a report that has been largely overlooked
(10). A marked increase in the frequency and severity of out-
breaks of human disease during the 1990s followed, often
involving horses; epidemics occurred in Algeria, Romania,
Morocco, Tunisia, Italy, Russia, France, Israel, and the United
States (11–18). Moreover, the recent outbreaks in Romania,
Israel, and the United States were characterized by concurrent
deaths in birds (19,20). The virus circulating in the United
States was found to be most closely related genetically to a
WNV isolate associated with goose deaths in Israel in 1998,
suggesting that the virus was imported into America from the
Near East, either in an infected bird, mosquito, human, or
other animal. The exact mechanism of the introduction will
probably remain unknown (18,19).
In southern Africa, WNV was found to be widely endemic
in areas where the principal vector, Culex univittatus, and
avian hosts of the virus are present. Human infections tended
to be sporadic; large epidemics occurred when unusually high
rainfall or hot weather favored breeding of the vectors (21–
23). Outbreaks were associated with concurrent epizootics in
birds, as evidenced by antibody studies, and 13 species of
experimentally infected wild birds supported replication of the
virus without becoming overtly sick or dying (24–26). The
largest epidemic occurred in 1974 and involved tens of thou-
sands of human cases over a 2,500-km2
area of the Karoo and
Northern Cape Provinces (5,21). A mean antibody prevalence
of 55% in humans was recorded in the affected region after the
outbreak; levels of 80% to 85% were recorded in some loca-
tions. In one town, 1,700 people sought medical attention.
Infections were most frequently subclinical or associated with
mild febrile illness characterized by rash, myalgia, and arthral-
gia. No human deaths were recorded, and no excess bird
deaths were observed, although an antibody prevalence of
53% was detected in wild birds after the outbreak (5,21). A
smaller epidemic occurred from 1983 through 1984 in associa-
tion with an outbreak of Sindbis virus (formal name: Sindbis
virus) infection in the Witwatersrand-Pretoria region of South
Africa, and again no deaths were recorded (23). Since then, the
number of human WNV infections confirmed in South Africa,
mainly on the basis of detection of antibody response, has
remained fairly constant at approximately 5–15 cases per year.
Only a proportion of suspected cases are subject to laboratory
investigation. Despite the apparently low level of virus activ-
ity, however in recent years, a few isolations of WNV have
been made from patients with severe disease, including a fatal
case of hepatitis in 1989 and nonfatal encephalitis in 2001
(National Institute for Communicable Diseases [NICD],
unpub. data).

infections, human case-fatality rates, and horse and bird deaths

in the Northern Hemisphere raised the question of whether a
recent emergence of WNV strains with increased pathogenici-
ties occurred or whether the virulence of the virus had previ-
ously been underestimated. Investigations with
hemagglutination-inhibition kinetics, titer ratios from cross-
neutralization tests, reactivity to monoclonal antibodies, and
cDNA/RNA heteroduplex restriction enzyme digest profiles
confirmed that strain differences occur but did not establish
any links between variants and pathogenicity (27–30). More
recently, phylogenetic analyses based on different regions of
the genome have shown that WNV isolates form two well-sup-
ported lineages (19,31,32). Lineage 1 includes viruses from
Africa north of the equator, Europe, Asia, and North America;
Kunjin virus (formal name: Kunjin virus [KUNV]) from Aus-
tralia constitutes a subtype of this lineage. Lineage 2 consists
solely of viruses from Africa and Madagascar. These findings
support the emergence of increased virulence in lineage 1. Lin-
eage 2 isolates are thought to be associated with endemic
infection of low virulence in Africa (18,19).
The South African prototype WNV isolate, H 442, was
obtained in 1958 from the blood of a person with mild febrile
disease who had been bitten by mosquitoes while catching
birds in mist nets for arbovirus studies (33). This isolate is the
only one from South Africa to have been included in a phylo-
genetic study, and its characterization as a member of lineage 1
(19) seems to be inconsistent with findings for other African
isolates from south of the equator. However, apart from recent
isolation of WNV from severe cases of human disease in
southern Africa, isolations of the virus were associated with a
fatal infection in a dog, a horse, and an ostrich chick (34;
unpub. data, NICD). Hence, we were prompted to undertake
phylogenetic investigation of southern African WNV isolates.
Methods and Materials
Virus Isolates
Phylogenetic analysis was performed on partial nucleotide
sequence data from 52 WNV isolates. This included 29 iso-
lates obtained from various sources in southern Africa from
1958-2001, which were sequenced for the study (Table 1).
Twenty-three WNV isolates and KUNV and Japanese enceph-
alitis viruses (JEV) for which sequence data were retrieved
from GenBank were also analyzed (Table 2). Southern African
isolations made at NICD included 8 human, 15 mosquito, 1
bird, and 2 sentinel animal isolates. Three isolates obtained by
the Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute, Pretoria, included the
horse and ostrich isolates, which originated from the Regional
Veterinary Laboratory, Stellenbosch, Western Cape Province,
and a dog isolate, which originated from the Veterinary Inves-
tigation and Research Laboratory, Gaborone, Botswana, and
was initially described as Wesselsbron virus (WESSV) but was
later found to be WNV (34; BJH Barnard, pers. comm.). No
isolates from the 1974 epidemic could be located for this
study. The isolates were stored at -70°C as freeze-dried 10%
mouse brain suspensions, and low-passage material was
selected for sequencing (Table 1). With the prototype isolate,
H 442, stocks of freeze-dried material were sequenced at vari-
ous mouse passage levels (2–7), and passaged 2 material was
passaged 10 times in mice and sequenced.
The bird, mosquito, and sentinel animal isolates (Table 1)
were obtained during epidemiologic studies (21); the human
isolates (Tables 1 and 3) were obtained from clinical speci-
mens submitted to the Arbovirus Unit or the Special Pathogens
Unit at NICD for the investigation of suspected cases of arbo-
virus infection or for the exclusion of African viral hemor-
rhagic fevers. In all instances, WNV was isolated from human
serum samples by mouse inoculation, except for patient 5,
from whom the virus was isolated from a liver sample taken at
autopsy.
Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction
(RT-PCR) and Nucleotide Sequencing of Amplicons
Freeze-dried mouse brain suspensions were reconstituted
in water, and viral RNA was extracted for the RT-PCR by
using the QIAamp Viral RNA kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A 255-bp region
of the E glycoprotein gene (genome positions 1402–1656) was
amplified with primers designated     2 and     0, as
described by                (32). The RT-PCR reactions were
performed with the TITAN One Tube RT-PCR kit (Roche
Diagnostics, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The nucleotide sequences of the amplicons were
determined with BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready
Reaction kits with AmpliTaq DNA polymerase FS (Applied
Biosystems, Warrington, Great Britain) according to the man-
ufacturer’s instructions. Sequences were obtained for both
strands of the DNA amplicons by using each primer,     2
and     0, for confirmation of the nucleotide sequence.
Products were purified by using Centri-Sep spin columns
(Princeton Separations Inc., Adelphia, New Jersey) and ana-
lyzed with a 377 GenAmp automatic sequencer (Applied Bio-
systems).
Phylogenetic Analysis
Editing and alignment of the nucleotide sequence data
were performed with DNASIS for Windows Version 2.5 (Hita-
chi Software Engineering America, Brisbane, CA). The phylo-
genetic analysis was performed on a 227-bp region of the
amplicons with a neighbor-joining distance method (unor-
dered “p” parameter model), with Phylogenetic Analysis with
Parsimony (PAUP) software version 4.0b4a for Macintosh
(35). Bootstrap confidence intervals were calculated by 500
heuristic search replicates.

agnosed fever, except for the three isolates obtained from
specimens submitted in 1989 from patients 4, 5, and 6 (Table
3) for the exclusion of African viral hemorrhagic fevers; tests
for Marburg disease, Ebola fever, Crimean-Congo hemor-
rhagic fever, Rift Valley fever, Lassa fever, and hantaviruses
were negative.
Patients 1–3 and 6–7 (Table 3) had benign WNV infections
with fever, rash, myalgia, and arthralgia; specimens from
patient 6 were submitted for the exclusion of viral hemor-
rhagic fever only because he had an outdoor occupation in
Namibia with potential exposure to ticks, and thus Crimean-
Congo fever was considered a possibility. Patient 4 also had an
outdoor occupation, in Free State Province of South Africa and
a definite history of exposure to mosquito bites. During the
second week of a febrile illness, he had coagulopathy with
abnormal prothrombin index and partial thromboplastin time,
hemoglobinuria, pancreatitis, and renal failure requiring dialy-
sis. He made a prolonged but full recovery.
Patient 5, who lived on the northern outskirts of Pretoria,
had fever, nausea and vomiting, epigastric pain, elevated blood
and urine amylase, elevated blood urea and creatinine values,
and markedly elevated transaminases. He was admitted to the
hospital on the second day of illness with low fever and tender
epigastrium. Tests for hepatitis A, B, and C and HIV were neg-
ative, and the patient died on the fourth day of illness. No
lesions of the pancreas were observed at autopsy, but a mas-
sive liver necrosis was found, and WNV was isolated from a
liver sample.

Patient 8 lived near NICD, a WNV-endemic focus with
artificial lakes and dams, reed beds, mosquitoes, and large bird
colonies. The patient was admitted to the hospital with a 2-day
history of headache, fever, nausea, and dizziness. She had
marked light sensitivity and terminal meningism. Cerebrospi-
nal fluid cultures and blood cultures were negative. She had
severe arthralgia, and after discharge from the hospital, a rash
developed. She made an uneventful recovery. Laboratory
investigation of her illness, with consequent recognition of
WNV infection, was probably influenced by the fact that she
was a relative of a member of staff of NICD; other cases of
WNV-induced encephalitis may have been missed.
The dog from which a WNV isolate was obtained in
Botswana (Table 1) was missing for 4 days and found in extre-
mis. The dog had severe diarrhea, became comatose, had con-
vulsions, and died (34). The dog was initially thought to have
rabies, and subsequently a flavivirus isolated from brain tissue
was thought to be WESSV, but ultimately was shown to be
WNV (34; BJH Barnard, pers. comm.). The horse isolate
(Table 1) was obtained from the brain of a 6-month-old Thor-
oughbred foal from a farm in Somerset West District, which
died after exhibiting signs of nervous disease. The ostrich
chick came from the Prince Albert district in the Western Cape
Province and was part of a major ostrich farming area where
death in young birds at approximately 2 to 3 weeks of age has
been a problem in recent years.
Genetic Relationships
A phylogenetic tree was generated from sequence data of
52 WNV isolates from 19 countries, plus KUNV and JEV, by
neighbor-joining distance analysis with node values generated
by 500 bootstrap replications (Figure). The topology shows
two distinct lineages. Lineage 1 includes 16 WNV isolates
from 13 countries in Europe, Africa, the Near East, India, and
the United States, and KUNV from Australia. The Indian iso-
late and Kunjin virus appear in lineage 1 as monophyletic sis-
ter clades. Excluding the Kunjin virus, the maximum
nucleotide sequence divergence exhibited in lineage 1

(21.5%), was between the Indian isolate G 167919 and CAR
isolate ArB 310. Otherwise, the divergences in lineage 1
ranged from a maximum of 10.6% between CAR isolate ArB
310 and Ivory Coast isolate ArA 3212, to a maximum homol-
ogy of 99.6% between a Senegal isolate AnD 27875 and Alge-
rian isolate Ar/Djanet.
Lineage 2 includes 36 isolates from 7 countries in Africa,
plus Madagascar. The maximum divergence of nucleotide
sequences in lineage 2 (18.9%) was between a bird isolate
from Madagascar AnMg 798 and several South African iso-
lates from humans and mosquitoes. In the South African iso-
lates, homology ranged from 86.3% to 100%. In some
instances, identical isolates originated from different sources,
years of isolation, or regions. The geographic dispersal of sim-
ilar isolates was illustrated by the approximately 99.6%
homology of Senagalese isolate ArD 78016 and several South
African isolates. In contrast, geographic overlap of divergent
isolates was also evident, as illustrated by the presence of
strains from CAR, Senegal, and Kenya in both lineages.
Discussion
The genetic relationships determined for isolates included
in this study were consistent with previous publications in
which isolates from different parts of the world fell into two
lineages; one included a few African isolates and all the Euro-
pean, Asian, and North American isolates; the second lineage
includes African and Madagascan isolates exclusively. In con-
trast to a previous finding (19), however, we determined that
the South African prototype isolate, H 442, belonged to lin-
eage 2 along with the other southern African isolates. Our
findings were consistent in tests with material of different
mouse passage levels, including material that had been stored
at mouse passage level 2 at the time that the original isolation
was made, supporting the conclusion that isolate H442 may
have been misidentified in a laboratory abroad. Although no
isolates from the 1974 South Africa epidemic could be located
for inclusion in this study, they probably belong to lineage 2.
All 29 southern African isolates tested belonged to lineage 2,
even those that were isolated up to 16 years before or up to 19
years after the epidemic.
The results of this phylogenetic study support previous
conclusions that the close relationships between certain iso-
lates from different countries and continents are compatible
with local and long-range dispersal of the virus by migratory
birds. On the other hand, the divergence between isolates of
the two lineages indicates that different strains are circulating

in some countries, such as CAR, Senegal, and Kenya. No
genetic distinction appears between strains circulating in
enzootic cycles and human outbreaks, and the wide range of
suitable vector hosts probably facilitates the dispersal of WNV.
The two extremes of bird migration routes, southern Africa
and Eurasia, have divergent strains, whereas the central
regions have a mixture of lineages 1 and 2. One possible
explanation is that, because of the distances involved, the birds
probably could not remain viremic from one extreme of their
migratory route to the other. Ultimately viruses will likely pass
from one region to the other.
Benign West Nile fever in humans is a febrile illness, with
myalgia, arthralgia, lymphadenopathy, and often maculopapu-
lar or roseolar rash. Other documented signs and symptoms
include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, conjunctivitis, abdominal
pain, pancreatitis, myocarditis, and hepatosplenomegaly. Few
patients have serious complications such as acute aseptic men-
ingitis, encephalitis, or necrotic hepatitis. Although many
patients are reported to have severe illness with high case-
fatality rates (4% to 13.3%) in recent epidemics in the North-
ern Hemisphere (16), serious disease occurs in 1% of infec-
tions (12,14,36,37). Moreover, most fatalities have been
recorded in elderly or immunocompromised patients. The
recent outbreaks have raised questions regarding strain varia-
tion and the possible emergence of enhanced pathogenicity.
However, during a 1957 WNV outbreak in Israel, the death
rate was 8.2% (4/ 49) in a group of elderly patients and 8.4%
(35/417) in a epidemic in the same country in 2000 (16). Thus,
the perceived virulence of the virus in recent epidemics may
partly be because of the emergence or reemergence of existing
strains of WNV in geographic locations with immunologically
naive populations, high medical alertness, and active surveil-
lance programs. When antigenic and molecular studies failed
to demonstrate differences between WNV isolates from
patients with hepatitis and benign disease in the CAR, rather
than ascribing differences in clinical manifestation to virus
strain variation, a new definition of disease spectrum to
include liver involvement was considered (10,30).
The fact that no cases of severe disease were recognized in
the large numbers of patients seen during the 1974 WNV epi-
demic in South Africa could indicate that isolates of lineage 2
lack virulence, but little clinical awareness of the pathogenic
potential of arboviruses in general may also have played a
role. The WNV epidemic coincided with the start of a major
Rift Valley fever (RVF) epidemic in South Africa. Only in the
next year (1975), when publicity surrounding the occurrence
of Marburg disease in the country alerted clinicians to hemor-
rhagic disease, were specimens from hospitalized patients with
unrecognized infections submitted for laboratory investigation
(38). The invesigation proved for the first time that RVF could
be a fatal disease in humans. Moreover, the isolations of
WNV from patients with severe disease in recent years,
including a fatal case of hepatitis and nonfatal mild menin-
goencephalitis during a quiescent period in virus activity, con-
firm that strains of lineage 2 can be pathogenic. Diagnosis of
these cases owed more to the availability of appropriate labo-
ratory services than to clinical recognition of WNV infection.
Clearly, a need for greater awareness of the variety of symp-
toms, including hepatitis, associated with WNV throughout its
distribution range is needed.
The occurrence of encephalitis in a dog in Botswana was
followed by a serosurvey and pathogenicity trials in South
Africa; the conclusion was that dogs are subject to WNV
infection but probably do not play an important role in the epi-
demiology of the disease (39). The occurrence of WNV in
horses in southern Africa is the subject of an ongoing investi-
gation, but the recognition of an equine case of encephalitis
remains an isolated event.
Although bird deaths characterized recent epidemics in the
Northern Hemisphere, the disease appears to have spared Afri-
can species in a New York zoo (19,20,40). Hooded crows had
previously been shown to be susceptible to experimental infec-
tion with an Egyptian isolate (41), but experimentally infected
adult wild birds of 13 species in South Africa had viremic
infection without overt disease (24–26). The only death
observed from an experimental infection in South Africa
occurred in day-old domestic chicks; susceptibility declined
with increasing age (PG Jupp, pers. comm.). WNV infection
may have been responsible for the deaths observed in young
ostrich chicks in the Western Cape Province, where the virus
was isolated from a dead chick (Table 1), but many viruses,
bacteria, intestinal parasites, and nutritional factors contribute
to the death of young birds, and investigations are continuing.
In conclusion, increased veterinary awareness of the patho-
genic potential of the virus is needed.
