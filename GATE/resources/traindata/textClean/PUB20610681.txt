As the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza virus continues to infect human populations globally, reports on
epidemiologically linked animal infections are also on the rise. Since December 2009, pandemic (H1N1)
2009-like viruses have been isolated in pigs from different swine farms of South Korea. Genetic and phyloge-
netic analyses of viral segments demonstrated several events of human-to-swine transmission with no apparent
signs of reassortment. These events were also supported by serological surveillance in pig sera collected from
April to December, suggesting that reverse transmission probably started between June and July with a drastic
increase in prevalence the following months. Although molecular characterization indicates that the swine
isolates are generally stable, some viruses are genetically evolving, most notably in their surface proteins.
Animal studies (ferrets and mice) reveal that swine pandemic isolates epitomize biological properties attrib-
uted to the currently circulating human pandemic viruses, including replication kinetics and efficient trans-
mission, indicating their potential to return to circulation among humans. Overall, these results indicate
widespread human-to-animal transmission of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza viruses in South Korea. With
the significant role of pigs in the ecology of influenza viruses, these transmission events should be closely
monitored and minimized to prevent the risk of generating viruses with greater human health concerns.
In June 2009, a global pandemic was declared by the World
Health Organization (WHO) for the emergence and rapid
spread of a novel influenza A (H1N1) virus (6, 7). The caus-
ative virus strain, termed as the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influ-
enza virus, is highly transmissible among humans and contains
a unique reassortment of gene segments derived from viruses
of the triple reassortant swine North American lineage and the
avian-like swine Eurasian lineage (12, 39). At present, the
mortality rate due to infection with the pandemic virus is rel-
atively low among humans, where the majority of laboratory-
confirmed infections result in self-limiting, uncomplicated in-
fluenza (44). Fatal cases are largely often associated with
preexisting medical conditions (40). Experts have already dem-
onstrated that the virus is pathogenic in mammalian hosts like
mice, ferrets, and nonhuman primates (18, 24, 26). Further-
more, pigs have been shown to be susceptible and can transmit
the virus (3, 18, 20, 30).
Accordingly, natural cases of reverse zoonosis into turkeys
and primarily pigs have been increasing considerably in differ-
ent continents since the first detection of the virus among pigs
in a Canadian swine farm (16, 41), as reflected in reports
through the weekly disease information of the Paris-based
World Organization for Animal Health Information Database
(28). Due to dual susceptibility to both human and animal
influenza viruses, pigs are considered important intermedi-
ate hosts, acting as "mixing vessels" for genetic reassortment
(4, 17, 23, 33). Such events may consequently lead to gen-
eration of novel reassortant influenza viruses which can
cause human pandemics or, as in the current influenza pan-
demic, a reassortant virus with potentially enhanced patho-
genicity and lethality.
Here we report the detection and isolation of the pandemic
(H1N1) 2009 influenza viruses isolated from various swine
farms in South Korea. Virus isolates were genetically charac-
terized to determine whether these swine viruses have under-
gone any evolutions that would significantly alter their overall
phenotype. Subsequently, pathogenicity and transmissibility in
ferrets were tested and compared with local Korean human
pandemic viruses and a recent Korean swine H1N1 virus.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Viruses and virus isolation.                          (               
04) is a recent swine influenza H1N1 virus strain isolated from a Korean swine
farm in 2004 (29). The 50% tissue culture infective doses (TC    ) of viruses
were determined by infection in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK).
Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza viruses were isolated using homogenized
lung tissue samples of commercially slaughtered pigs, which came in from dif-
ferent swine farms, by infection into MDCK cells. Briefly, the samples were
processed and inoculated onto monolayers of MDCK cells and then incubated
for 1 h at 37°C to allow for viral adsorption to the cells. The cells were rinsed two
times each with 1 cold phosphate-buffered solution (PBS), before and after
sample inoculation, after which appropriate culture growth medium containing a

final concentration of 1 g/ml L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone
(TPCK)-treated trypsin solution (Sigma-Aldrich) was added. Viral growth was
determined by observing morphological changes in the cells (cytopathic effects)
and by hemagglutinin (HA) assay. Subtyping was done by using two multiplex
reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assays and sequencing as previously de-
scribed (5).
Genomic sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. Viral RNA was extracted
from cell culture isolates using a QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia,
CA). RT-PCR was carried out under standard conditions using influenza-specific
primers (14). Nucleotide sequencing of the amplified products was carried out
using a DNA sequencer (model 377; Applied Biosystems, PerkinElmer, Foster
City, CA) and a Taq dye deoxy terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Bio-
systems, Foster City, CA). The sequences were resolved using the ABI Prism
collection program (PerkinElmer, Foster City, CA). The DNA sequences were
compiled and edited using the Lasergene sequence analysis software package
(Lasergene, version 5.07; DNAStar, Inc., Madison, WI). Multiple se-
quence alignments were made using Clustal_X (1, 38). The rooted phylograms
were prepared using the neighbor-joining (NJ) algorithm and then plotted using
the program NJ plot (31).
Serologic assays. Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays were performed as
previously described (21) to determine the seroprevalence of pandemic (H1N1)
2009 viruses since April 2009. All collected swine sera were heat inactivated at
56°C for 30 min and pretreated with receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE) from
Vibrio cholerae (Denka Seiken, Tokyo, Japan) to remove nonspecific serum
inhibitors. The sera were then tested for antibody against the swine pandemic
virus                   by the HI technique with 0.5% turkey red blood cells
(RBC). The HI titer was determined by the reciprocal of the last dilution that
contained turkey RBC with no agglutination. A neutralization test was done on
selected HI-positive sera to confirm results (21). Virus-neutralizing titers were
determined by infection of MDCK cells and expressed as the reciprocal of the
highest dilution of serum that gave 50% neutralization of 100 TC     of virus
after incubation at 37°C for 72 h (19). Hemagglutination assays were performed
according to WHO/World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) recommen-
dations.
Replication and transmission studies. Groups of four 15- to 18-week-old
specific-pathogen-free (SPF) ferrets (Marshall Bio Resources, New York, NY)
were instillated intranasally (i.n.) with 105
TC     of Korea/    /09,          
        , or                   virus in 1 ml of sterile PBS (divided between
two plastic syringes for separate inoculation of each nostril) under isoflurane
anesthesia. To monitor virus transmission, two seronegative animals were co-
housed at 1 day postinfection (dpi) in adjacent transmission cages fitted in the
same isolator separated by a screen mesh (5 cm apart) preventing direct or
indirect animal contact but allowing the spread of influenza virus through the
respiratory droplets from experimentally infected animals. Clinical signs among
tested ferrets were noted while body temperatures were recorded daily, begin-
ning 1 day before experimental inoculation. Groups of 12 5-week-old BALB/c
mice (Samtaco, Seoul, Korea) were i.n. inoculated with 30 l 105
TC    /ml of
Korea/    /09,                  , or                  . All viruses and
animal experiments including serologic testing were handled in an enhanced
biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) containment facility approved by the Korea Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention.
Experimental sampling and virus titration. Nasal washes and rectal swabs
were collected daily from all ferrets for 12 days. Different tissue samples (tonsils,
trachea, lungs, liver, spleen, kidney cecum, and rectum) were harvested on 3 and
5 dpi from infected ferrets to examine tissue distribution of test viruses. Lung
tissue samples of mice were collected at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 dpi. To prevent
cross-contamination, different sterile instruments were used for collecting each
tissue. Swabs, nasal washes, and collected tissue samples were homogenized in
1 PBS containing antibiotics. Tissue homogenates and supernatants were clar-
ified by centrifugation at 12,000  g, and supernatants were transferred to new
tubes. All samples were immediately serially diluted 10-fold and then inoculated
into 11-day-old embryonated chicken eggs for virus titration as computed by the
Reed and Muench method with results expressed as log10 50% egg infective dose
per milliliter or gram of tissue collected (E    /ml or E    /g) (32). The limit of
virus detection was set to 0.7 log10 E    /ml. Standard deviations for virus titers
and body temperatures are indicated appropriately. Student's t test was used for
statistical analysis.
Nucleotide sequence accession numbers. Complete sequences of the eight
viral gene segments of all viruses collected from humans and swine were sub-
mitted in GenBank. Accession numbers assigned to the sequences determined in
this study are     9430 to     9669.
RESULTS
Virus isolation from field samples. A total of 42 (eight on 4
December 2009, two on 10 December 2009, seven on 24 De-
cember 2009, and 15 on 2 January 2010) swine influenza vi-
ruses were isolated from 456 swine lung tissue samples (9.21%)
collected in swine slaughterhouses within Chungbuk province,
South Korea, since November 2009. The virus isolates were
subtyped as H1N1 using multiplex RT-PCR and subsequent
sequencing. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the amplicons
indicated that each of the eight RNA segments of all the
isolates have high nucleotide homology to pandemic (H1N1)
2009 influenza viruses currently circulating among humans as
determined through BLAST homologies (99% sequence
identities). Positive detection and isolation of the pandemic
virus among local pigs were promptly reported to correspond-
ing authorities. No other subtypes of swine influenza virus were
detected or isolated during the span of the sampling period.
Phylogenetic analyses. The pandemic (H1N1) 2009 isolates
from swine were aligned with sequences from human and other
animal influenza viruses available in GenBank which bore the
highest homology (99% identity on all gene segments) with
the viruses in the study. Local human pandemic (H1N1) 2009
influenza viruses isolated from patients suffering from respira-
tory diseases in Chungbuk National University Hospital were
also included. Pairwise sequence analysis of the H1 gene seg-
ments showed that the pandemic viruses from swine form at
least three groups: group I (4 December 2009 isolates,    
               to                  ) isolates are more
closely related to a human pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza
virus from Singapore (Singapore/    11/09; 99.7% se-
quence homology), while group II (10 December 2009 isolates,
                  and                  ) and group III
(24 December 2009 and 2 January 2010 isolates,          
         to                  ) isolates clustered separately
with local Korean human isolates (99.4 to 99.8%) (Fig. 1a).
Phylogeny of the neuraminidase (NA) genes also reflected the
same clustering observed in HA genes (Fig. 1b). Average ho-
mology of viruses between the three groups is about 99.2 and
99.5% (HA and NA, respectively), whereas isolates within
each group of isolation are highly identical to each other,
sharing as high as 100% nucleotide sequence identities. There-
fore, phylogenetic alignment of the surface genes (HA and
NA) suggest that these viruses may have been derived from
different human pandemic viruses.
Phylogenies of all the internal genes revealed that all are
genetically related to human pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza
viruses currently circulating worldwide. Specifically, the PB2,
PB1, PA, NP, and NS genes were placed into the lineage of
triple reassortant swine viruses predominantly found in North
American pigs, while the M genes also fell under the Eurasian
avian-like swine H1N1 viruses like their virus precursors (7, 12;
data not shown). Interestingly, the group I isolates appear to
cluster consistently with Sw/Singapore-         , the first re-
ported cases of swine pandemic (H1N1) influenza virus in
Singapore. In contrast, results from group II and III isolates
indicated that they are more phylogenetically related to human
pandemic viruses isolated from the same region. Overall, phy-
logenetic analyses presumably suggest that there were at least
three individual events of human-to-swine transmissions.

Molecular characterization of viral genes. To determine
whether the viruses have undergone significant molecular
modifications during the course of natural transmission in pigs,
the deduced amino acid sequences of the viral genes, gener-
ated and aligned using the MegAlign program of the Laser-
gene sequence analysis software package (Lasergene, version
5.07; DNAStar, Inc., Madison, WI), were examined. Synony-
mous to all isolates, the cleavage site contains a single basic
amino acid residue (Arg), and residues at positions 187 and
222 (H1 numbering) retained human-type cell receptor speci-
ficities (Table 1) (27, 36). However, three consensus substitu-
tions in group I isolates were found at sites (Ser84Asn,
Asp86Gly, Asp94Glu) near the second stabilizing shell of the
protein (Cys90 and Pro92; H1 numbering) and a conserved
component of the H1 receptor binding pocket (Tyr91) (Table
2) (43). Isolates within group II and group III also bear mu-
tations in their HA1 regions at positions 74 (Ser to Asn) and
116 (Iso to Met), respectively. In the N1 protein, at least two
consensus mutations could be observed in group II and III
isolates (Table 2). All potential glycosylation sites in the sur-
face proteins of group I and II isolates appear to have been
coherently conserved with reference to the          virus,
while group III isolates had gained an additional N-linked
glycosylation (Asn35) in their NA. Furthermore, all Korean
pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza isolates (human and swine)
have consensus mutations in their HA1 (Pro83Ser, Ser203Thr)
and N1 (Val106Iso) proteins compared to virus strain       
09, indicating uniform genetic substitution at these positions
(Table 2).
Few synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations could also
be observed in three segments (PB2, PA, and NP) of the swine
isolates which have not been previously implicated with repli-
cation, pathogenicity, or virulence. However, all defined mo-
lecular markers in viral proteins, such as PB2 (11, 13, 22, 25,
37), PB1 (46), M2 (15), and NS1 (34), have been relatively
conserved similar to their pandemic (H1N1) influenza virus
(        ) ancestor (Table 1).

pig sera collected since April 2009 from swine-producing prov-
inces in Korea were tested by HI assays using the          
         virus. For cross-reference and to ensure specificity of
serum reactivity, a natural Korean swine H1N1 virus (   
              ) was also used in the serological testing. It is
of note that a national vaccination program was conducted in
October 2005 (29); thus, the reference swine strain would help
interpret false-positive results. Of the 1,621 pig sera surveyed,
60 (3.7%) had HI antibody specific for the novel pandemic
virus, while 49 (3.0%) sera were positive for the Korean swine
H1N1 virus (Table 3). Dual-positive samples (i.e., samples
positive for both viruses) were also noted in 219 (13.58%)
swine sera. Serologic surveillance indicated that initial intro-

duction of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus into pigs occurred
possibly between the months of June and July, which drasti-
cally increased by early fall (August to September). On the
other hand, seropositivity against                   rela-
tively decreased from April to December (Table 3). When the
dual-positive sera from August to December (72 swine sera)
were reprocessed and further segregated by HI titers, more
seropositive samples (40 HI units) were obtained against
                  compared to the seroreactivity against    
               HI titers (40 HI units) (Table 4). This
result suggests that the higher proportion of the reactive sera
were probably due to exposure with pandemic (H1N1) 2009
influenza viruses.
To confirm the specificity of the HI results, virus neutraliza-
tion tests were conducted. Results showed that neutralizing
antibodies against the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus correlated
with the titers obtained from the HI assays, which reached up
to 1,280 (Table 4). In contrast, lower neutralizing antibody
titers (at least a 2- to 4-fold difference) were observed in the
swine sera when the Korean                   H1N1 virus
was used (data not shown).
Animal studies. Molecular analysis suggests that the swine
pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza isolates are undergoing the
process of genetic evolution, albeit slowly. To determine
whether the noted molecular changes have an impact on the
overall phenotype of the virus, groups of SPF ferrets were i.n.
instillated with 105.0
TC     of Korea/    /09,          
        , or                   virus.
Infection of ferrets with Korea/    /09 and          
         viruses generally induced more severe flu-like symp-
toms (e.g., sneezing, nasal discharge, and immobility) than
                 -infected ferrets throughout the course of
experiment (data not shown). Constantly more elevated body
temperatures were also recorded in ferrets infected with the
pandemic viruses (Fig. 2). Shedding of all test viruses through
the nasal route started at 1 dpi, peaked at 2 dpi, and persisted
up to 6 dpi (Table 5). In all the days sampled, the human and
swine pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza isolates had compara-
ble replication kinetics that were consistently higher than nasal
wash titers obtained from                  -inoculated fer-
rets (6.5 and 6.63 versus 5.75 log10 E    /ml, respectively,
during peak titers; P  0.05). However, none of the inoculated
viruses could be detected in rectal swabs (data not shown).
One of the naïve "contact" ferrets (those that have been ex-
posed to experimentally inoculated ferrets) of          
         was already positive for virus transmission as early as
1 day postcontact (dpc), while the other contact host was able
to acquire the virus at 2 dpc. Both the contact ferrets of Korea/
    /09 were also positive for detection at 2 dpc. In contrast,
the                   virus was transiently detected in one
of the contact ferrets at 2 dpc, lasting only up to 3 days. All
experimentally inoculated and positive contact ferrets were
seroconverted (data not shown).
All inoculated viruses could be recovered only in respiratory
tissues tested (data not shown). Consistent with nasal wash
viral titers, lower tissue titers could also be detected in    
              -infected hosts compared to those inoculated
with the Korea/    /09 or                   isolate. How-
ever,                   could not yield tissue viral titers
beyond the limit of detection in tonsils and lungs at 5 dpi.
Experimental inoculation of respective viruses in mice recapit-
ulated results similar to those observed in ferrets. Infection
with the pandemic (H1N1) isolates (Korea/    /09 and    
              ) indicated relatively higher lung viral titers
than the                   virus in mice (data not shown).
DISCUSSION
April 2009 marked the emergence and global spread of a
novel influenza A (H1N1) virus in humans, causing the first
human influenza pandemic of the 21st century (6, 7). Detailed
genomic sequence analysis of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in-
fluenza virus reveals that it contains a unique reassortment of
genes from viruses of North American and Eurasian pigs, es-

tablishing their swine origins (12, 39). Since the emergence of
the novel pandemic virus, notifications from different countries
on natural infections in swine herds have been increasing con-
siderably, including sporadic transmissions in breeding turkeys
and in a few domesticated pet animals (2, 28). We describe
here the first detection and isolation of pandemic (H1N1)
2009-like influenza viruses from swine lung tissue samples ran-
domly collected from different swine farms in South Korea.
A pig farm in Alberta, Canada, was the first confirmed case
of animal infection with the pandemic virus in May 2009 (16),
and experts predicted that such infection of animal farms
would be more likely as the current pandemic progresses glo-
bally. It is particularly difficult to estimate when the pandemic
(H1N1) 2009 virus was first introduced into Korean swine
herds. However, our serological surveillance provided evi-
dence that sporadic human-to-swine transmission may have
started between June and July, which drastically increased
during the following months. Although dual-positive speci-
mens were also noted in some of the pig sera tested (at 20 to
40 HI titers), most evidently in April and May (Table 2), this
cross-reactivity might be induced by vaccination and/or previ-
ous exposure to                  -like or other H1-like vi-
ruses in some pigs. We had previously shown that double-
vaccinated hosts (mice, ferrets, and miniature pigs) could

induce only 40 serum antibody titers against the pandemic
(H1N1) 2009 influenza virus (30).
The latest update in South Korea has already tallied about
132 cumulative numbers of human fatal cases (8). To evaluate
the genetic origins of swine pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza
viruses in this report, we included in our analysis those human
pandemic isolates from patients with respiratory diseases com-
ing from Chungbuk National University Hospital, located in
the same province where the swine isolates were collected. All
of the collected swine isolates phylogenetically fall under the
pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza virus lineage with no appar-
ent evidence of reassortment. Although there were no signif-
icant differences, phylogenies of the surface genes form distinct
nodes, suggesting at least three independent introductions of
pandemic viruses into pigs: one group of isolates (group I) was
more closely related to a human pandemic virus from Singa-
pore (Singapore/    11/09), whereas later groups of isolates
(group II and group III) share the same root with local Korean
human pandemic viruses (Fig. 1). Though limited, evidence
has suggested that most human-to-animal transmissions oc-
curred following direct contact (28, 45). Thus, we could also
predict that the swine infections in this report may also be
epidemiologically linked to human infections, although the
precise source or origin of infection is relatively unknown.
None of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 viruses isolated from
the Canadian swine herd were identical (41), even though they
presumably came from a single point of infection (16). Wein-
             noted high proportions of nonsynonymous-to-syn-
onymous nucleotide substitutions for both the H1 and N1
genes (41). In contrast, our swine isolates appear to be rela-
tively genetically stable, with viruses within each group having
high homology. Of the three groups of swine isolates, group I
has the most consensus mutations, most notably around a
position (Tyr91) which is a component of the receptor binding
site (RBS) of the H1 protein, the major surface antigen. It is
noteworthy that 94Glu lies within the phylogenetically impor-
tant region D (PIR D) (amino acids 94 to 97 in H1 numbering)
of the H1 protein (Table 2) (9). PIR D corresponds to the
trimer interface on H3 hemagglutinin which is involved in the
pH-induced conformational change of the molecule (42). Most
neutralizing antibodies against influenza HA recognize
epitopes in the hypervariable regions that surround the RBS
and interfere with binding to host cells (10). Thus, modifica-
tions on these sites might provide escape from immune recog-
nition, which is critical if the virus is to successfully infect and
be established in new hosts. Though it is tempting to speculate
that the observed genetic modifications were due to passage
through pigs, we could not rule out the possibility that these
arose during the passage through humans or cumulatively
through both.
Experimental infection of representative human (Korea/
    /09) and swine (                 ) pandemic isolates in
ferrets still epitomizes disease severity and efficient transmis-
sion of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza viruses in this host
(26, 30), although                   appears to be more
readily transmitted to naïve contact ferrets. Both Korea/
    /09 and                   induced higher viral titers
(through the nasal route and respiratory tissues) and were
more transmissible than the                   swine virus
in ferrets (Table 5). These results might imply that the pan-
demic viruses isolated from swine herds still have the potential
to return to circulation in humans. To date, there has been no
evidence yet that pigs play a significant role in the epidemiol-
ogy and spread of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza virus in
humans. Unfortunately, challenge studies were not carried out
in pigs due to time constraints and the unavailability of an
expansive biocontainment facility. Thus, accompanied by a
lack of pertinent clinical data available associated with the
swine isolates, we could not predict how these viruses behave
in swine. Whether the viruses were newly transmitted to pigs or
have been serially infecting pigs is also a matter that is difficult
to presume. We could only infer that following transmission,
subsequent infections may have been subclinical since there
have been no reports of outbreaks in swine farms prior to this
report. Thus, further studies shall shed more light on these
concerns.
What is certain in this report is that we provide evidence
demonstrating widespread human-to-swine transmission of the
pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza virus in Korea. Feared for
their potential as genetic mixers for human and animal influ-
enza viruses (4, 17, 23, 33), pigs could provide an alternative
opportunity to generate more virulent variants or novel vi-
ruses. It is therefore imperative that human-to-animal or pos-
sibly animal-to-human transmissions of the pandemic (H1N1)
2009 influenza virus, especially events involving pig herds, be
closely monitored and minimized.
