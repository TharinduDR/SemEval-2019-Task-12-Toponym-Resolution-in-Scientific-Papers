Abstract: Longitudinal studies typically suffer from incompleteness of data. Attrition is a
major problem in studies of older persons since participants may die during the study or are too
frail to participate in follow-up examinations. Attrition is typically related to an individual’s
health; therefore, ignoring it may lead to too optimistic inferences, for example, about cognitive
decline or changes in polypharmacy. The objective of this study is to compare the estimates
of level and slope of change in 1) cognitive function and 2) number of drugs in use between
the assumptions of ignorable and non-ignorable missingness. This study demonstrates the
usefulness of latent variable modeling framework. The results suggest that when the missing
data mechanism is not known, it is preferable to conduct analyses both under ignorable and
non-ignorable missing data assumptions.
Keywords: attrition, latent variable modeling, longitudinal, Mini-Mental State Examination,
number of drugs, older persons

Introduction
Cognitive decline and polypharmacy, defined as use of multiple drugs or more drugs
than are medically necessary, are major and often interrelated health problems affecting
the older population.1,2 There is a rich literature dealing with the potential determinants of cognitive decline and polypharmacy as well as interventions to reduce these
phenomena.3–5 Longitudinal studies among the oldest old, however, typically suffer
from incompleteness of data; attrition is a major challenge since these very elderly
participants may die during the study or become too frail to participate in follow-up
examinations. Attrition is typically related to the individual’s health, and the remaining participants may no longer be representative of the original study population.6
Accordingly, ignoring missing observations may lead to biased results and to overly
optimistic inferences about cognitive decline or trends in polypharmacy.7
Very few of the previous studies investigating cognitive decline in older people,
measured for example as a change in the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)
score, have considered how the missing data mechanism can affect the trend estimate.8
Different methods have been used in earlier studies eg, investigation of change scores
that assume missing completely at random (MCAR) mechanism for dropouts. However,
there are more sophisticated methods such as mixed models, latent growth models,
and growth mixture models which allow for missing at random (MAR).9–11 The study
of Muniz-Terrera et al demonstrated latent growth curve (LGC) analyses that allow
for both random and non-random missingness but the results of the measurement
models were reported only for the MAR mechanism.12 With respect to polypharmacy

in older persons, developmental trends have been presented
as a difference in the number of drugs in use between two
time points assuming a linear trend.13–17
Data from the Geriatric Multidisciplinary Strategy for the
Good Care of the Elderly (GeMS) study, a population-based
3 year follow-up study of a random sample of persons aged 75
and older in a Finnish city, provided us with an opportunity
to examine the impact of missing data mechanism on the
estimates of change in cognitive function and the number of
drugs in use. These outcome variables were chosen because
they display different features: the MMSE score declines
with age and has missing values due to both unit and item
non-response. The number of drugs in use at a given point in
time typically increases with age and has missing values only
because of unit non-response. More specifically, our objective was to compare the estimates of baseline level and the
slope of change in cognitive function and number of drugs
in use produced by traditional models with an assumption of
ignorable missingness and Diggle-Kenward selection models
that include explicit models for missing data mechanism and
assume either ignorable or non-ignorable missingness.18–22
The aim of this study was to identify the best fitting model
for both outcomes and to evaluate the significance of the
differences among the estimation results. The secondary
objective was to demonstrate the usefulness of a latent
variable modeling framework. In this paper, LGC models,
alone and combined with logistic regression models for the
missing data mechanism, were fitted to the dataset in a structural equation modeling framework using Mplus software.23
LGC measurement models were preferred as these models
employ a straightforward mathematical formulation and the
estimation results do not require advanced mathematical
expertise to interpret the outcome. An additional motivation
for the study was that an example of estimating a selection
model including the LGC model as a measurement model
was recently described in the sixth version of the Mplus
User’s Guide.24

Material and methods
Data came from the baseline examination of the GeMS study
and its three follow-up examinations performed at 1 year
intervals in 2004–2007. The original GeMS sample population (n=1,000) was selected randomly from persons born
before 1 November 1928 and living in the city of ­Kuopio,
Finland. The GeMS study has been described in greater detail
elsewhere.25–27 Our study population included those 781 persons who participated in the baseline examination.

During the 3 year follow-up, 172 persons (22%) of the
baseline population dropped out, primarily because of death
(153 persons or 89% of dropouts) (Figure 1). This type of
missingness can be called monotone missingness, attrition,
or dropout because once a person left the study he or she
could not return. Both unit and item non-response occurred
in the GeMS study. The sample characteristics with sample
sizes are shown in Table 1.
Data on cognition and drug use were collected during
the interviews conducted by three trained study nurses.
Here, the MMSE test consisted of 30 items. Test results
vary between 0 to 30 points with lower points indicating
cognitive impairment. At the baseline examination, eleven
participants had missing data. This was mainly because the
participants were demented or experienced difficulties with

c­ ommunication (item non-response). Earlier studies have
shown that a low MMSE score is predictive for the probability
of dropping out of a study.9,12,28
During the interview, participants were asked to specify
all the drugs (prescription and over the counter) they were
currently taking in an open-ended question. In an attempt
to reduce recall error, participants were requested to bring
their drug containers and prescriptions with them to the
interview. If the participant was unable to answer the questions, the required information was given by a close relative
or caregiver. Therefore, the number of drugs being used
by the participant could be measured for all participants at
every examination. The number of drugs included all drugs
ie, those being taken regularly and those taken as needed.
Further, earlier studies have shown that the number of drugs
in use is associated with mortality.29,30
In the baseline examination, information on participants’
background and health status was also recorded. In the present analyses, age and sex were used as external covariates to
predict the probability of dropout.9,12

Statistical modeling
Missing data mechanisms
Missing data mechanisms were classified according to
Rubin’s taxonomy.31 Dropout was considered as MCAR
if the probability of dropping out did not depend on the
observed or unobserved outcomes. If the dropout was MAR,
the probability of dropping out may have depended on the
observed outcomes, but it was conditionally independent
of unobserved outcomes given the observed outcomes.
However, if the dropout was not MCAR or MAR, it was

Clinical Epidemiology 2015:7

missing not at random (MNAR). For example, in studies of
older individuals, persons with rapidly declining cognition
can be expected to leave the study either because they die
or become too frail to participate. If the probability of the
MMSE score missing at a particular examination was related
to its value at previous examinations, but not upon current
or future values, then the missing data were MAR but not
MCAR. If observations were MNAR, then the probability
of observing the MMSE at examination t was related to its
potentially unobserved value at that same examination. In
this longitudinal setting with monotone dropout, if data
were MAR, the likelihood-based analysis that ignores the
missing data mechanism produces valid inference; hence,
MAR was termed as ignorable dropout whereas MNAR was
termed as non-ignorable as the explicit model for missing
data mechanism was needed.32
The effect of the missing data mechanism on the estimation was explored by comparing estimation results
derived by traditional models with the ignorable missing
data mechanism and the Diggle-Kenward selection models
which included explicit models either for ignorable or nonignorable missing data mechanism. In this study, indicator
variables R of dropout, scored as binary discrete-time survival
indicators, were defined to identify what is known and what
is missing.

Measurement model
In our study, LGC models were used as a measurement model
for full data to investigate the growth rates of the MMSE
scores and the number of drugs in use and the association
between the baseline level and the developmental trend
across four examinations.33 The adopted LGC model can be
presented as a piecewise linear trend model
yt = η1 + λtη2 + εt, t = 1,2,3,4,
η1 = α1 + ζ1,

(1)

η2 = α2 + ζ2,
where yt is the observed outcome, η1 is a latent level component and η2 is the latent slope component.34–36 Similarly,
parameters α1 and α2 are the means of the latent level and
slope components. Variables εt are the measurement errors,
and variables ζ1 and ζ2 consist of the variations of the latent
level and slope components, respectively. The mean values of
variables ε and ζ were zero and all covariances between them
were assumed to be zero. Parameters λt are factor ­loadings

at time t for the latent slope and, to obtain an identifiable
model, restrictions λ1=0 and λ4=1 were applied. The covariance matrix of the latent variables is cov(η) = cov(ζ) = Ψ and
the covariance matrix of the observed responses is cov(y) =
ΛΨΛT + Θ, where
1 1
ΛT = 
 0 λ2

1 1
,
λ 3 1

(2)

and Θ is the covariance matrix of the measurement errors.
The mean values of the observed outcomes can be written
as follows:
Ey1 = α1,
Ey2 = α1 + λ2α2,

(3)

Ey3 = α1 + λ3α2,
Ey4 = α1 + α2.

Dropout model
In the selection models, binary logistic regressions were
fitted together with LGC models to take into account the
relationships between the previous and/or current measured
outcome variables and the dropout (Figure 2).21,32 The logistic
regression model used as a model for dropout makes it possible for dropout to depend on both observed and missing
outcomes and on covariates x; for example,
Logit[p(r | y, x, ψ)] = ψ0 + ψ1αt + ψ2xt + ψ3yt-1 + ψ4yt (4)
at time t. Dropout is ignorable when the regression coefficient
ψ4=0 and non-ignorable otherwise.

Table 2 lists all the LGC models and selection models
according to the outcome variable. By varying the composition of the explicit dropout models we wanted to discover how
sensitive the estimates from the measurement models would
be to different specifications for the dropout process.
Goodness of fit of the LGC models was evaluated using
five indicators: χ2 test, comparative fit index (CFI), TuckerLewis index (TLI), root mean square error of approximation
(RMSEA), and standardized root mean residual (SRMR).37,38
A non-significant P-value (P$0.05) related to the χ2 test
indicates that the model provides a good fit for the data.
The CFI evaluates the adequacy of the specified model in
relation to the baseline model and it varies between 0 and
1 with values greater than 0.95 reflecting an excellent fit of
the model to the data. The TLI is a normed-fit index that has
a similar interpretation as the CFI. The RMSEA measures
the approximation error in the model and values below 0.05
are suggestive of an excellent fit. Finally, the SRMR measures the average of the residual correlations and values less
than 0.03 are indicative of an excellent fit of the model. The
Satorra-Bentler chi-square difference test was used to test
the fit between the nested models.39,40
All the statistical analyses were performed within a
structural equation modeling framework using the Mplus
statistical package Version 6.12 with the standard MAR
missing data method where missing values are not imputed,
but instead parameters and standard errors are estimated
from all available data.23 Robust Maximum Likelihood
estimation was used to derive non-normality robust standard
errors, because the MMSE score and the number of drugs in
use were not normally distributed.24 All P-values reported
are two sided.

Results
Dropout model
It was not clear whether or not the missing data in our study
sample were ignorable and no test was available to distinguish
between ignorable and non-ignorable missingness. It was found
that at every follow-up examination, MMSE scores before
dropout were statistically significantly lower for dropouts than
for those who remained in the study (unpaired Student’s t-tests,
P,0.001). A similar phenomenon appeared with the number of
drugs in use; those remaining in the study used a lower number
of drugs than those dropping out at each particular examination except at the first follow-up examination (unpaired t-tests,
P,0.001; except for the first follow-up, P=0.072). For those
who refused to participate after the baseline examination or the
first or second follow-up examinations, the missingness was
assumed to be non-ignorable. However, when a participant died,
he/she has left the universe of interest and literally speaking
there is no missing data at all.41 In these situations, missing
data may often be regarded as ignorable. However, according
to Schafer and Graham, a steep decline in an unmeasured outcome may precede the death of a participant if examinations
are spaced far apart in time, and this means that the missing
data should be assessed as non-ignorable.41 In this study, sensitivity analyses of the missingness assumption in traditional
models were performed by jointly modeling the measurement
and dropout processes under the Diggle-Kenward selection

Clinical Epidemiology 2015:7

In an attempt to estimate the growth rates and the association between baseline level and growth rate, LGC models
were fitted. First, traditional models under the assumption of
ignorable missing data were fitted and the shape of the growth
was investigated. Second, when the suitable shape had been
identified, explicit models for missing data mechanism were
added into the traditional model. In our dataset, nine missing
data patterns emerged for the MMSE score.

Ignorable LGC models
In the context of the MMSE score, a model with latent
intercept and slope components was estimated first. In
this model, the slope was defined to measure the average
rate of change between the baseline examination and the
last follow-up examination. The fit of the final model was
good: χ2 (3, N=777) =9.49, P=0.02, CFI =0.99, TLI =0.98,
RMSEA =0.05 and SRMR =0.02. The estimation results of
the model are shown in Table 3 (Model 1).
The mean of the MMSE score at baseline was 24.6 points.
The average rate of growth was negative and statistically
significant (−2.99, P,0.001) meaning that during the
3 years, the average MMSE score declined by three points.
The variance of the latent baseline level component (43.10,
P,0.001) and the variance of the latent slope component
(18.52, P,0.001) were both statistically significant indicating that there were significant inter-individual differences in
these two factors. In addition, the covariance between latent
baseline level and latent slope was positive and statistically
significant (17.24, P,0.001) suggesting that the higher the
baseline score, the slower the rate of decline from baseline
to the end of the 3 year follow-up.
When logistic dropout models were jointly modeled
with the measurement model (Diggle-Kenward model with
ignorable missing data assumption), the growth estimate of
the MMSE score and other parameters remained at the same
level as in the previous model (Table 3, Model 2). The model
revealed that the previous MMSE score was associated with
the likelihood of dropping out of the study at the next followup examination. For example, an individual having one point
higher MMSE score at the first follow-up examination in
2005 had 0.89 times lower odds of dropping out of the study
before the follow-up examination in 2006 compared to those
having a one point lower MMSE score at the first follow-up
examination (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.87, 0.92).

Non-ignorable LGC models
Next, the assumption of non-ignorable missing data mechanism was taken into account by adding the current MMSE
scores as predictors for the dropout probabilities into
Model 2 (Table 3, Model 3). The model is presented graphically in Figure 2. This means that for those who dropped out
of the study, the current outcome was unobserved. Dropout
models with time-variant effects of the previous and current MMSE scores on the probability of dropout were
considered. The mean of slope estimate of the LGC model
reduced to −1.74 (P,0.001) points per 3 years, which is
considerably less than the estimates obtained with Models 1
and 2 (−2.99 and −2.87 points respectively) which applied

the ignorable missing data assumption. Variances of the
level and the slope remained unchanged in comparison to
previous LGC models.
Odds ratios from the logistic dropout models were in the
opposite direction for the previous and current MMSE scores:
high previous score decreased the risk of dropout whereas
high current, potentially unobserved score increased the risk
(Table 3, Model 3). For example, rewriting the estimation
results for the year 2006 as
Logit{p(dropout2006)}
= Intercept − 0.082* (MMSE2006 + MMSE2005)
− 1.057*(MMSE2006 − MMSE2005),

suggests that the probability of dropout increases when
MMSE scores decrease. The average level of the MMSE
score has only a minor influence on the probability of dropout.
Since there were odds ratios with broad 95% CIs and highly
correlated MMSE scores, we concluded that the coefficients
and their standard errors were being affected by collinearity
problems and therefore, the CIs were not interpreted. However, according to the Satorra-Bentler chi-square difference
test (χ2=13.38, df =3, P=0.004) Model 3 still remained preferable to Model 2. (For the Mplus syntax used to produce
Model 3, see Supplementary material.)
When a selection model under non-ignorable missingness
with only the current measured MMSE scores as predictors
for the dropout probabilities was evaluated, it was observed
that odds ratios were in the same direction and of the same
magnitude as in Model 2 for the previous measured MMSE
scores (Table 3, Model 4). However, the odds ratios for
the current MMSE scores were in the opposite direction
to the corresponding odds ratios in Model 3. The estimate
of the average growth rate was closer to the corresponding
estimates from the models with ignorable missingness than
found with Model 3 under non-ignorable missing data.
Finally, age and sex were added to Model 3 as external
covariates for the probability of dropping out of the study
in order to investigate whether external covariates could
convert the non-ignorable process into an ignorable one.
The results revealed that the effect of external covariates
on the odds ratios and the CIs of the previous and current
MMSE scores was only marginal and the growth estimate
remained unchanged (Table 3, Model 5). Sex did not exert
a statistically significant effect on the probability of dropout
while the risk of dropping out increased with increasing
age. According to the Satorra-Bentler chi-square difference test (χ2=22.19, df =6, P=0.001) Model 5 is preferable
to Model 3.
Altogether, when comparing the five LGC models for
the MMSE scores with or without explicit models for missing data mechanism, it could be seen that the choice of
the dropout model had an effect on the growth estimates of
the LGC model. According to the Satorra-Bentler chi-square
difference tests between nested models, Model 5 under the
assumption of non-ignorable missing data was preferred.

Modeling results for number of drugs
In investigation of how missingness could affect the growth
estimates when exploring changes in polypharmacy, LGC
models for the number of drugs in use were investigated.
In the same manner as for the MMSE score, LGC models

Clinical Epidemiology 2015:7

Missing data mechanism and change estimates

under ignorable and non-ignorable missing data assumptions
were evaluated.

Ignorable growth curve models
Starting with a traditional model under an assumption of
ignorable missing data, an LGC model was estimated with
the latent intercept and linear slope components. The fit
of the model was poor: χ2 (5, N=781) =56.14, P,0.001,
CFI =0.96, TLI =0.95, RMSEA =0.11 and SRMR =0.02, and
the modification indices suggested that letting the error terms
correlate would improve the fit of the model significantly. The
fit of the final model was good: χ2 (4, N=781) =7.74, P=0.10,
CFI =1.00, TLI =1.00, RMSEA =0.04 and SRMR =0.01
(Table 4, Model 6).
The average number of drugs at baseline was 6.46 and
the rate of growth was positive and statistically significant,
0.36 drugs (P,0.001). In other words, it would take approximately 3 years to receive an extra drug due to the linear
growth (Table 4, Model 6). The variances of the latent level
component and the latent slope component were statistically
significant, 10.66 (P,0.001) and 0.36 (P,0.001), respectively, indicating that there were significant inter-individual
differences in these two growth factors. According to the
zero-covariance between the latent intercept component and
the latent slope component, there was no dependence between
the baseline level and the rate of growth.
When binary logistic regressions with dropout indicators were added to the previous model in order to explicitly
model the ignorable missing data mechanism with the previous measured numbers of drugs as time-variant covariates,
the growth estimate remained the same as in the traditional
model. This selection model is presented in Table 4 as
Model 7. The variances of the latent variables were reduced,
but only marginally. The number of drugs in use was related
to dropping out of the study ie, the higher the number of
drugs in use at the previous examination, the more likely
was the dropout.

Non-ignorable growth curve models
Adding the current number of drugs as a predictor for the
probability of dropout in addition to the previous measured
number of drugs to Model 7 made it possible for us to investigate the effect of non-ignorable missing data assumption
on the growth estimate (Table 4, Model 8). The average
baseline level estimate and the growth rate estimate as well
as their variances were at the same level as in Models 6 and 7
when ignorable missing data assumption was applied. As
in the corresponding Model 3 for the MMSE score, odds

ratios describing the effect of the number of drugs in use on
the dropout probabilities were again in opposite directions
for previous and current values although there was some
fluctuation across one in odds ratios for the current number
of drugs among the years. Rewriting the dropout model for
the year 2005 as

suggests that the probability of dropout in 2005 increases
when there is a large increment in the number of drugs
between the previous and current year. The average level
of number of drugs has only a minor influence on the probability of dropout. Satorra-Bentler chi-square difference test

ignorable missing data assumption achieved a better fit than
Model 8 when non-ignorable missingness was assumed
(χ2=7.17, df =3, P=0.067).
In addition a model was explored when one uses the
non-ignorable missing data assumption where the current
measured number of drugs in use alone predicted the probability of dropout. The growth estimate increased slightly
while all the other estimates remained at their original level
(Table 4, Model 9). As in Model 7 where probability of
dropout was regressed on the previous measured number of
drugs in use, the current number of drugs was statistically
significantly related to dropping out of the study: the more
drugs the participant had at the follow-up, the more likely it
was that he/she would be missing in that particular followup examination. However, some of the odds ratios for the
­current number of drugs were in the opposite direction to
the corresponding odds ratios in Model 8.

Clinical Epidemiology 2015:7

Adding age and sex into Model 8 under the assumption
of non-ignorable missing data did not have any effect on the
growth estimates and their standard errors when compared
to a similar model without external covariates (Table 4,
Model 10). The results revealed that sex did not exert a
statistically significant effect on the probability of dropout,
but increasing age increased the risk of dropping out of the
study at all of the follow-up examinations.
To summarize, when comparing all the five LGC models fitted for the number of drugs outcome with or without
explicit models for the missing data mechanism, the growth
estimates did not vary extensively between the models. With
respect to the LGC models with explicit models for missingness, Model 7 using the ignorable missing data assumption
was preferred.

Discussion
This case study on cognitive function and polypharmacy
in older persons reveals that missing data mechanism is a
key component in analysis of data from longitudinal studies among older persons. It was not obvious whether the
missing data in this study were ignorable or non-ignorable;
therefore, ignoring the missing data mechanism might have
led to invalid and inefficient inferences of the population of
interest. Secondly, the usefulness of latent variable modeling
was demonstrated.
The results from the LGC models revealed that, in case
of the continuous outcomes, the results derived by explicitly
modeling the non-ignorable missing data mechanism in
selection models suffered from collinearity problems due
to high correlations between consecutive measures in the
logistic part of the models. The MMSE score contained
an item non-response in addition to a non-response due to
dropout whereas the number of drugs could be measured for
all persons participating in the GeMS study. For the MMSE
score, the best fitting model was the selection model utilizing
the non-ignorable missing data assumption with additional
predictors for dropout. This model suggested that the average
baseline MMSE score remains at its level (24.6 points) and
the slope of change is slower (−1.8 points for non-ignorable
and −3.0 points for traditional model) during the 3 years of
follow-up when compared with the estimation results from
the traditional LGC model. CIs of the slope estimates were
not overlapping (95% CIs [-1.1, −2.4] and [−2.5, −3.4],
respectively). For the outcome number of drugs, models
utilizing the ignorable missing data assumption had the
best fit; no clinically significant differences emerged in
the estimation results obtained from various models fitted

Clinical Epidemiology 2015:7

Missing data mechanism and change estimates

(6.4–6.5 drugs for baseline level and 0.3–0.4 drugs for the
slope of change). However, the selection model utilizing the
ignorable missing data assumption revealed that the previous
number of drugs predicted the probability of dropout. This
type of information cannot be produced by traditional models.
The results for the number of drugs outcome were consistent
with those of Schafer and Graham and Collins et al – departures from the assumption of ignorable missingness were not
strong enough to have any clinically significant impact on estimates and standard errors.41,42 On the other hand, Diggle and
Kenward reported similar results as found here for the MMSE
score in Models 3 and 5 with the non-ignorable missing data
assumption.18 They explained the difference in growth rates
produced by ignorable and non-ignorable models in terms of
the parameters of the dropout component of a selection model
rather than as a problem due to collinearity.
It is also worthwhile considering how sensitive MMSE
scores or number of drugs as outcome variables, are to older
persons deteriorating or dying, especially when these outcomes are measured at 1 year intervals. It might be that in
this study deviations from ignorable missingness were not so
marked because of the short interval between examinations.
In the studies conducted by Muniz-Terrera et al and Dufouil
et al, follow-up interviews were carried out on an average
of 2, 7, and 9 years after the baseline examination, and as a
result, explicit modeling of the non-ignorable missing data
mechanism was recommended.12,28
In selection models, three separate logistic models for
dropouts were constructed, one for each of the follow-up
examinations, and combined with measurement models.
Our hybrid models were selection models that have been
criticized for employing missing data mechanisms which
may be implausible.43 In preliminary analyses, adding years
of education and self-reported health (in addition to age and
sex) as predictors into the non-ignorable dropout models had
only a negligible effect on the baseline and change estimates
(data not shown). The final non-ignorable analyses were
performed without these covariates. Some authors have
proposed fixing parameters for current outcome in dropout
models at reasonable values with expert opinion. This was
considered inappropriate in our study since some unverifiable assumptions would need to have been made.43,44 Based
on the estimation results from this study, previous MMSE
scores and number of drugs were sufficiently representative
to predict the dropout since examinations were performed
annually and also deaths, which were the principal cause
(89%) of dropouts, occurred within a relatively short period
before the following examinations. The previously measured

outcomes were statistically significant predictors of drop-out,
which is an indication of a survival bias.
In our data, the outcomes were not normally distributed;
hence, the Robust Maximum Likelihood estimation was
applied. The outcome number of drugs is a count variable but
was treated as a continuous variable in growth curve models
as the variable was not bounded at zero. Alternatively, we
could have used the LGC model for a count outcome assuming a Poisson or negative binomial distribution which is
straightforward in the Mplus.24 In addition to Diggle-Kenward
selection models, other alternatives with which to model
the non-ignorable missing data mechanism using maximum
likelihood estimation included shared parameter models,45
pattern-mixture models,21,32 Muthén et al22 newly introduced extensions of the before mentioned models and
Beunckens et al46 proposed latent-class mixture models. In this
study, deaths and other reasons for dropout were combined
and missing data indicators were created based on them since
they both resulted in permanent missing data. Application of
the selection models in a study of older people was conceptually challenging because the outcomes were related to death.
Another possibility would be to model deaths separately from
other types of missingness.
The design of the GeMS study can be regarded as a limitation of this study. The number of examinations (altogether
four) limits the choice of models that can be constructed.
Structural equation modeling is a very flexible method of
analysis when both continuous and discrete representations
are provided in the same model. From the latent variable
models estimated in this paper, it can be concluded that traditional LGC models fitted with the assumption of MAR were
robust since taking the ignorable missing data mechanism
into account did not have any effect on the growth estimates.
Finally, we conclude that in the context of longitudinal studies of an elderly population where attrition is a problem, it
is recommended that sensitivity analyses for the assumption
of missing data should be performed and caution is needed
when modeling non-ignorable missing data.
