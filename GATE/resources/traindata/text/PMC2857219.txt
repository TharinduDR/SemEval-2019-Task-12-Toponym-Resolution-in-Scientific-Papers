Four US soldiers acquired hemorrhagic fever with renal
syndrome while training near the Demilitarized Zone, South
Korea, in 2005. Hantaan virus sequences were amplified by
reverse transcription–PCR from patient serum samples and
from lung tissues of striped field mice (Apodemus agrari-
us) captured at training sites. Epidemiologic investigations
specified the ecology of possible sites of patient infection.
Hantaan virus (HTNV), the etiologic agent for hemor-
rhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), accounts
for ≈70% of all HFRS cases in South Korea and is the most
severe of the 4 rodent-borne hantaviruses (Seoul virus,
Soochong virus, and Muju virus) found there (1–3). Re-
cently, a shrew-borne hantavirus, Imjin virus, was isolated
from Ussuri white toothed shrews (Crocidura lasiura)
captured near the Imjin River in South Korea (4). The res-
ervoir host of HTNV, the striped field mouse (Apodemus
agrarius), is the most abundant field rodent found in South
Korea. We conducted an epidemiologic investigation for
rodents at 6 training sites near the Demilitarized Zone after
4 US soldiers acquired HFRS in 2005, because no evidence
of rodent activity was found where the soldiers worked or
resided at their base camp (Camps Hovey and Casey).
The Study
On October 27, 2005, a US soldier (patient 1) assigned
to Camp Hovey, Dongducheon, exhibited signs and symp-
toms of HFRS (Table 1). The patient was transferred to
the Brian Allgood Army Community Hospital (BAACH),
Yongsan Army Garrison, Seoul, South Korea, and on Oc-
tober 28, 2005, was confirmed to be seropositive for han-
tavirus infection by ELISA. A medical advisor initially
suspected that the patient may have acquired the infection
while sweeping out a dusty storage area at Camp Hovey,
where he resided, ≈3 days before the onset of symptoms. A
survey of the suspected storage room did not uncover any
signs of rodent activity. These data along with the known
incubation period of hantaviruses (4–>50 days) prompted a
further search for the actual site of transmission.
A blood sample from patient 1, tested by both the in-
direct immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) technique and
reverse transcription–PCR (RT-PCR), confirmed that the
patient was infected with HTNV. An epidemiologic sur-
vey was conducted, and results showed that the patient had
trained at 4 US- and South Korea–operated training sites
from 26 to 35 days before the onset of symptoms. The pa-
tient had first trained at local training area (LTA) 320, then
at LTA 36/37, and finally at firing point (FP)-60 (Figure 1).
The training consisted of setting up firing positions, estab-
lishing a cantonment site, and performing other training ac-
tivities for 5 days before moving on to FP-60, where troops
conducted firing exercises from September 25–29, 2005,
before returning to Camp Hovey.
On November 8–9, 2005, two soldiers (patients 2 and
3) from Camp Casey, Dongducheon, had signs and symp-
toms of HFRS and so were sent to the BAACH where they
received a diagnosis of HFRS (Table 1). Patient 4 from the
same unit sought treatment at the Camp Casey Troop Medi-
cal Clinic on November 13 with low-grade fever, decreased
appetite, abdominal pain, chills, low back pain, nausea, and
vomiting, and was provided fluids and assigned to quar-
ters (home bed rest). On November 14, laboratory results
indicated a nonspecific proteinuria characteristic of HFRS
infections, and the patient was transported to the BAACH,
where HFRS was diagnosed. Blood samples from all 3 pa-
tients were positive for HTNV by IFA and RT-PCR. All 3
patients had trained at Twin Bridges Training Area (TBTA)
with potential incubation periods that ranged from 16 to 35
days, and 2 (patients 2 and 4) had trained together at Ro-
driguez and Watkins Ranges 3 days before conducting a
tactical move to TBTA (Table 1; Figure 1). Patients 2 and
4 conducted training at TBTA-North (N) and TBTA-South
(S), and patient 3 only conducted training at TBTA-N.
Small mammal trapping was conducted at US and
South Korea–operated training sites where the HFRS pa-
tients had previously trained within 60 days. Preseasonal
(September) A. agrarius mice trapping rates were relative-
ly low at both FP-60 (11.4%) and Rodriguez Range (7.6%),
and although postseasonal trapping rates were high at FP-60

(42.3%), they remained relatively low at Rodriguez Range
(15.7%) (Table 2). During the fall, hantavirus seropositive
rates were high at FP-60 (20.0%) and Rodriguez Range
(31.3%). During the winter, seropositive rates increased at
FP-60 (25.8%), but decreased at Rodriguez Range (12.1%).
During the winter, seropositive rates at TBTA-N (26.3%)
and TBTA-S (37.8%) were high, but were relatively low at
other training sites (LTA320/36/37) surveyed.
Blood samples from each of the 4 patients and lung
tissues of seropositive rodents were assayed by RT-
PCR. RNA extracted by using RNA-Bee isolation kit
(TEL-TEST Inc., Friendswood, TX, USA) was reverse
transcribed by using the superscript II RNase H-reverse
transcriptase kit (GIBCO-BRL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA).

GGATTACAACCCCAGCTCG-3′) amplified a 373-nt re-
gion of the hantavirus G2-encoding medium (M) segment
(1,5,6). Amplified products were fractionated according
to size by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels contain-
ing ethidium bromide (0.5 mg/mL). DNA sequencing was
performed in both directions, by using the dye primer
cycle sequencing ready reaction kit (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, USA) on an automated sequencer (Mod-
el 3730XL; Applied Biosystems).
Phylogenetic analysis, both neighbor-joining and
maximum-parsimony methods, based on the 320-nt re-
gion of the G2 glycoprotein–encoding M segment of the
4 HFRS patients, and HTNV sequences amplified from
the A. agrarius mice captured at FP-10, FP-60, TBTA-N,
and TBTA-S demonstrated that the HTNV sequence am-
plified from patient 1 was identical to sequences from A.
agrarius HTNV strain (04–1325) at FP-60. The analyses
also demonstrated that the HTNV sequences from patients
2 and 4 were identical to A. agrarius HTNV sequence
(05–1437) at TBTA-S, and the HTNV sequence from pa-
tient 3 was identical to A. agrarius HTNV sequences (07–
196 and 05–1465) at TBTA-N. These data demonstrate
the most likely site of infection for the 4 HFRS patients
(Figure 2).
Conclusions
The relationships between rodent density, the propor-
tion of hantavirus-seropositive rodents, and incidence of
human infection are complex and poorly understood (7,8).
Previous literature indicates that a prevalence of hantavi-
rus seropositivity >20% among A. agrarius mice greatly
increased the risk for transmission (9–11). Although moni-
toring rodent populations may provide some warning, the
most effective means of controlling hantavirus infections is

Korea (patients 1–4), 2005 (GenBank accession nos. FJ561275–
FJ561278) and field mice (Apodemus spp.)–borne Hantaan
viruses (HTNV). HTNV sequence amplified from patient 1 was
identical with a HTNV sequence (Aa04–1325) from A. agrarius

patients 2 and 4 were the same as 3 HTNV sequences (Aa05–
1437, Aa06–119, Aa06–171) from A. agrarius mice captured
at Twin Bridge Training Area–South (TBTA-S), and the HTNV
sequence from patient 3 was identical to 11 HTNV sequences

ducing the rodent populations. Efforts to mitigate disease
risks through modernization of training sites, cutting of
vegetation that increases predation of small mammals, and
habitat reduction within 50 m of military operations, where
possible, are being instituted at selected US-operated train-
ing sites as a result of consolidation and modernization of
large, multipurpose range complexes.
Previously, phylogenetic analysis of a 324-nt region
of the G2 glycoprotein-encoding M genomic segment has
been shown to be representative of the entire M segment
(6). This region may be useful for classifying newly iden-
tified hantaviruses (when cross-neutralization data are un-
available) or for further analysis of molecular phylogeny
of hantaviruses spatially. The genome of HTNV sequences
obtained from patient 1 was identical to a viral sequence
from an A. agrarius field mouse captured at FP-60 and
those from patients 2 and 4 were identical to 3 viral se-
quences from A. agrarius at TBTA-South, and patient 3
was identical to 11 viral sequences from A. agrarius field
mice at TBTA-North. These data showed the epidemiolog-
ic link between US soldier patients and rodent hosts at the
training sites near the Demilitarized Zone in South Korea.
