Abstract
Although based on very limited M and L segment sequences, Artybash virus (ARTV) was proposed previously
as a unique hantavirus harbored by the Laxmann’s shrew (Sorex caecutiens). To verify this conjecture, lung
tissues from 68 Laxmann’s shrews, captured during 2006 to 2014 in eastern Siberia, Russia, and Hokkaido,
Japan, were analyzed for ARTV RNA using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). ARTV
RNA was detected in six Laxmann’s shrews. Pairwise alignment and comparison of partial- and full-length S,
M, and L segment sequences from these Laxmann’s shrews, as well as phylogenetic analyses, using maximum
likelihood and Bayesian methods indicated that ARTV was distinct from other soricine shrew-borne hanta-
viruses and representative hantaviruses harbored by rodents, moles, and bats. Taxonomic identity of the ARTV-
infected Laxmann’s shrews was confirmed by full-length cytochrome b mitochondrial DNA sequence analysis.
Our data indicate that the hantavirus previously known as Amga virus (MGAV) represents genetic variants of
ARTV. Thus, the previously proposed designation of ARTV/MGAV should be replaced by ARTV.
Key Words: Hantavirus—Japan—RT-PCR—Russia—Shrew.
Introduction
Recent discovery of genetically distinct hantaviruses
(family Bunyaviridae and genus Hantavirus) in multiple
species of soricine and crocidurine shrews (order Eu-
lipotyphla, family Soricidae, and subfamilies Soricinae and
Crocidurinae), as well as in moles (family Talpidae and
subfamilies Talpinae and Scalopinae) and insectivorous bats
(order Chiroptera), challenges the conventional view that
rodents (order Rodentia and families Muridae and Cricetidae)
are the principal reservoir hosts. Broad taxonomic and geo-
graphic distribution of hosts indicates that small mammals
other than rodents played a significant role in the evolution-
ary history of hantaviruses and points to the urgent need to
understand the diversity, distribution, and phylogeography of
hantaviruses worldwide (Bennett et al. 2014, Yanagihara
et al. 2014).
Seewis virus (SWSV), originally detected in the Eurasian
common shrew (Sorex araneus) in Switzerland (Song et al.
2007), has now been found across the vast distribution of its
soricine reservoir host in the Czech Republic (Schlegel et al.
2012), Finland (Kang et al. 2009a, Ling et al. 2014), Germany
(Schlegel et al. 2012), Hungary (Kang et al. 2009a), Poland
(Gu et al. 2014), Russia (Yashina et al. 2010), Slovakia
(Schlegel et al. 2012), and Slovenia (Korva et al. 2013; Res-
man et al. 2013).
Genetically distinct hantaviruses have also been detected
in other Sorex species, including Ash River virus in the North
American masked shrew (Sorex cinereus) and Jemez Springs
virus in the dusky shrew (Sorex monticolus) (Arai et al.
2008a), Kenkeme virus in the Asian flat-skulled shrew (Sorex
roboratus) (Kang et al. 2010), Asikkala virus in the Eurasian
pygmy shrew (Sorex minutus) (Radosa et al. 2013), Yakeshi
virus in the taiga shrew (Sorex isodon) (Guo et al. 2013), Qian

Hu Shan virus in the stripe-back shrew (Sorex cylindricauda)
(Zuo et al. 2014), and Sarufutsu virus in the long-clawed
shrew (Sorex unguiculatus) (Arai et al. unpublished data).
In addition, based on very limited M and L segment se-
quences detected in a Laxmann’s shrew (Sorex caecutiens)
captured near Teletskoye Lake in the Altai Republic of
western Siberia, a new hantavirus, named Artybash virus
(ARTV), has been proposed. In an attempt to validate its
reservoir host species and explore the genetic diversity of
ARTV, we analyzed lung tissues collected from Laxmann’s
shrews trapped in eastern Siberia, Russia, and Hokkaido,
Japan. Genetic and phylogenetic analyses, based on partial-
and full-length genomes of a hantavirus formerly called
Amga virus (MGAV), show that it represents genetic variants
of ARTV. Thus, instead of referring to this hantavirus as
ARTV/MGAV, as previously proposed (Bennett et al. 2014),
ARTV should be the preferred designation.
Materials and Methods
Trapping and sample collection
Laxmann’s shrews, which are widely distributed from
northern Fennoscandia through Siberia and across northern
Japan (Fig. 1A), were captured at three sites in the Sakha Re-
public, Russia, during July and August 2006 (Fig. 1B and
Table 1) and five sites in Hokkaido, Japan, between 2008 and
2014 (Fig. 1C and Table 1). Protocols for trapping, euthanasia,
and tissue processing were performed according to well-
established guidelines (Animal Care and Use Committee 1998).
RNA extraction and reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction
Total RNA was extracted from lung tissues using the Pure-
Link Micro-to-Midi Total RNA Purification Kit (Invitrogen,
San Diego, CA) or MagDEA
RNA 100 Kit (Precision System
Science; PSS, Matstudo, Japan). cDNA was synthesized using
SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen) or
PrimeScript II 1st strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Takara Bio,
Otsu, Japan) and an oligonucleotide primer (OSM55: 5¢-
TAGTAGTAGACTCC-3¢) designed from the genus-specific
conserved 3¢-end of the S, M, and L segments of all hanta-
viruses.ForinitialscreeningbyRT-PCR,primerswerebasedon

Genetic and phylogenetic analysis
Pairwise alignment and comparison of partial- and full-
length S, M, and L segment sequences of hantaviruses from
Laxmann’s shrews, as well as other representative rodent-,
shrew-, mole-, and bat-borne hantaviruses, were performed
using the ClustalW method (Thompson et al. 1994). Phy-
logenetic analyses were conducted using maximum likeli-
hood and Bayesian methods, implemented in MrBayes 3.1
(Ronquist and Huelsenbeck 2003) and RAxML (Stamatakis
et al. 2008), under the best-fit GTR + I + G model of evolu-
tion using MrModeltest 2.3 (Posada 2008). Two replicate
Bayesian Metropolis–Hastings Markov chain Monte Carlo
runs, each consisting of six chains of 10 million genera-
tions sampled every 100 generations with a burn-in of
25,000 (25%), resulted in 150,000 trees overall. Topologies
were evaluated by bootstrap analysis of 100 iterations,
and posterior node probabilities were based on 10 million

Host species identification
Because shrews are inherently difficult to identify by mor-
phological features alone, host verification of ARTV-infected
shrews was confirmed by analyzing the entire 1140-base pair
cytochrome b gene of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), ampli-
fied by PCR, using modified universal primers (Cy-14726F: 5¢-
GACYARTRRCATGAAAAAYCAYCGTTGT-3¢ and Cy-
15909R: 5¢-CYYCWTYIYTGGTTTACAAGACYAG-3¢)
(Arai et al. 2008b). A Bayesian approach, as described above,
with midpoint rooting was used to determine the phylogenetic
relationship between Laxmann’s shrews and other shrew and
mole species known to harbor distinct hantaviruses.
Results and Discussion
ARTV RNA was detected by RT-PCR in five of 39
(12.8%) and one of 29 (3.4%) Laxmann’s shrews captured in
Russia and Japan, respectively (Table 1). All but one of the
six ARTV-infected shrews were males.
Analysis of the full-length nucleotide and amino acid se-
quences of the S, M, and L segments (GenBank accession
numbers: KF974360, KF974359, and KF974361, respec-
tively) of ARTV strain Mukawa AH301 showed considerable
divergence from representative hantaviruses harbored by
shrews in the Soricinae subfamily in Eurasia (Table 3): S,
22.9–27.3% and 13.3–16.0%; M, 20.9–23.8% and 8.4–
12.7%; and L, 20.2–22.1% and 5.7–8.7%, respectively. In
contrast, alignment and comparison between ARTV strain
Mukawa AH301 and the very limited S, M, and L segments
of ARTV strains ART502, Galkino2712, and Parnaya1205
showed higher sequence similarity at the amino acid level
(Table 3).
Phylogenetic analyses of ARTV strain Mukawa AH301,
based on the full-length coding regions (comprising 1290-
nucleotide S, 3420-nucleotide M, and 6456-nucleotide L
segment sequences), showed similar topologies, with ARTV
strains from the Sakha Republic and ARTV strains detected
independently in Laxmann’s shrews captured in the Altai
Republic and Khabarovsk Krai of Russia forming a separate
geographic-specific cluster (Fig. 2). Moreover, ARTV strains
were distinct from recently detected hantaviruses harbored by
other Sorex shrew species in Eurasia. In contrast, differences
in the phylogenetic positions of some soricine shrew-borne
hantaviruses may be attributed to the limited sequences, es-
pecially for the M and L segments.
The identities of the six ARTV-infected shrews were
confirmed as Laxmann’s shrews (GenBank no. KF974362
for strain AH301; GU562415, GU562416, GU562417,
GU562418, and GU562422 for strains MSB148558,
MSB148559, MSB148436, MSB148457, and MSB148347,
respectively). The cytochrome b mtDNA sequences of the
ARTV-infected Laxmann’s shrews from Japan and Russia dif-
fered by 4.0–6.4%. The ARTV-negative shrews from Japan
were also identified as Laxmann’s shrews by analysis of the
1140-nucleotide cytochrome b mtDNA gene (GenBank nos.
KU760858 to KU760884). However, the full-length cyto-
chromebmtDNAsequencevariationwas0–1.1%and0.5–1.1%
among Laxmann’s shrews in Japan and Russia, respectively.
Host phylogenies based on mtDNA cytochrome b se-
quences of shrew and mole species, which harbor genetically
distinct hantaviruses, showed two separate lineages of Lax-
mann’s shrews (Fig. 3). This was consistent with previous
studies suggesting at least two genetic races of Laxmann’s

shrews distributed in Eurasia and Japan (Ohdachi et al. 2003).
That is, based on analysis of the full-length cytochrome b
gene, Laxmann’s shrews were separated into Hokkaido and
Eurasian Continent–Sakhalin–Cheju clusters. Individuals in
the latter cluster do not always reflect the geographical
proximity of their capture locations, which is consistent with
an ancestral isolation of the Hokkaido population, occurring
*13,000 years before present (Tanabe et al. 2015), and recent
rapid range expansion of the modern Eurasian Continent–
Sakhalin–Cheju population (Ohdachi et al. 2003).
The phylogeographic variation in ARTV reflects the dis-
tinct evolutionary histories of these variants. Similar patterns
of geographic variation have also been reported for rodent-
borne hantaviruses. For example, geographic-specific genetic
variants have been reported for Puumala virus in the bank
vole (Myodes glareolus) (Garanina et al. 2009), Tula virus in
the European common vole (Microtus arvalis) (Song et al.
2004), and Andes virus in the colilargo (Oligoryzomys
longicaudus) (Torres-Perez et al. 2011). Both Muju virus in
the royal vole (Myodes regulus) (Lee et al. 2014) and Hok-
kaido virus in the grey red-backed vole (Myodes rufocanus)
and northern red-backed vole (Myodes rutilus) (Yashina et al.
2015) may represent genotypes of Puumala virus. These
examples point to the urgency of studying the phylogeo-
graphic variation of viruses and their hosts to provide an
essential foundation for understanding their evolutionary
histories and as a prelude to forecasting their future emer-
gence under changing environmental conditions (Hope et al.
2013, Campbell et al. 2015).
Although ARTV was detected in a single Laxmann’s
shrew captured in the Mukawa area in Japan, the evidence is
compelling that this Sorex shrew species harbors ARTV
across its broad geographic range. Our findings suggest that
Laxmann’s shrews, resident on Hokkaido Island before the
geologic separation from the Eurasian continent, might have
already been infected with ARTV. Renewed attempts to
isolate ARTV from Laxmann’s shrews captured in Eurasian
Continent–Sakhalin–Cheju and Japan are warranted to better
understand its evolutionary origins and phylogeography, as
well as its pathogenic potential in humans.
