Abstract
Understanding the role of humans in the dispersal of predominately animal pathogens is essential for their control. We used
newly developed Bayesian phylogeographic methods to unravel the dynamics and determinants of the spread of dog rabies
virus (RABV) in North Africa. Each of the countries studied exhibited largely disconnected spatial dynamics with major geo-
political boundaries acting as barriers to gene flow. Road distances proved to be better predictors of the movement of dog
RABV than accessibility or raw geographical distance, with occasional long distance and rapid spread within each of these
countries. Using simulations that bridge phylodynamics and spatial epidemiology, we demonstrate that the contemporary
viral distribution extends beyond that expected for RABV transmission in African dog populations. These results are strongly
supportive of human-mediated dispersal, and demonstrate how an integrated phylogeographic approach will turn viral
genetic data into a powerful asset for characterizing, predicting, and potentially controlling the spatial spread of pathogens.

Introduction
Every year approximately 55,000 people die from rabies [1].
Over 99% of these deaths occur in developing countries where
rabies virus (RABV; negative-sense RNA virus, family Rhabdovir-
idae) is endemic in the domestic dog [2]. Rabies has been neglected
across much of Asia and Africa, despite becoming an increasing
problem in the recent decades [1,3,4]. Although the history of
rabies in Africa prior to the 20th century is uncertain [5], the
currently circulating dog rabies virus is thought to have emerged
during the 19th and 20th centuries [6,7]. Despite the importance
of dogs as vectors for human rabies, little is known about the
spatial and temporal dynamics of rabies in this major reservoir
species, or the processes responsible for its maintenance in specific
geographic localities. In particular, the role of human activities in
mediating the spread of dog RABV is unclear, nor is it known how
landscape characteristics, including human infrastructures such as
roads, affect RABV dispersal within dog populations. However,
such information is critical to revealing the determinants of RABV
transmission and hence for its control in the domestic dog.
We used a recently developed probabilistic approach [8] to
determine the spatial and temporal dynamics of dog RABV
transmission from a large-scale gene sequence study. We encode
different phylogeographic scenarios of viral spread, as well as
different landscape features, in a model-based approach, and
choose among these models in a quantitatively rigorous fashion.
Our focus was on dog populations in North Africa where RABV
has been endemic for more than a century, and our key aim was to
determine how ecological, anthropogenic and evolutionary
dynamics shape the spatial distribution and spread of this
important zoonotic pathogen [9,10,11,12].
Results/Discussion
We first inferred the evolutionary history of 287 RABV
sequences (3080 nt; encompassing the whole N, P and intergenic
G-L region) sampled from Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia and the
Spanish territories from North Africa (Ceuta and Melilla) between
1986 and 2008. All these viruses are assigned to the Africa 1
genotype (relevant epidemiological information for all RABV
PLoS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 1 October 2010 | Volume 6 | Issue 10 | e1001166
isolates analysed in this study is presented in Table S1 in
Supporting Information S1). We estimated the timescale of this
evolutionary history using a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) approach [13]. The most recent common ancestor of all
the North African RABV sampled here was estimated to have
existed between 1878–1945, supporting previous suggestions that
dog RABV was periodically responsible for local sporadic
epidemics in the middle of the 19th century [14], and that rabies
became enzootic in this entire region during the 20th century.
More generally, this timescale is consistent with the expanding
European colonial influence in North Africa [7]. This analysis also
revealed distinct phylogenetic lineages in Algeria, Morocco and
Tunisia, indicating that viruses generally grouped according to
their country of origin (Figure 1). This result is unexpected if the
virus is only dispersed through the local movement of animals as
observed in wildlife rabies [9,10] as these would not respect geo-
political boundaries. Indeed, we found only a few exceptions to the
country-specific clustering, such as two Algerian sequences within
the Moroccan clade and four Moroccan sequences in the Algerian
clade. The Africa 1 clade is therefore consistent with the general
phylogeographic pattern observed for dog RABV at reasonably
large geographic scales; a series of spatially distinct clusters that
experience relatively little contact among them [6,7].
To analyze intra-country patterns of viral transmission in more
detail, we considered a stochastic diffusion process among the 20
(Algeria) and 28 (Morocco) sampling localities for which most data
were available (Figure 2 and Figure S1 in Supporting Information
S1). We quantified the degree of spatial admixture using a
modified Association Index (AI, [8,15]), and by summarizing the
number of inferred transitions to each location within Algeria and
Morocco (Table 1) based on an analysis in which rates of diffusion
between each pair of locations were estimated. Although these
analyses reveal that there is still significant spatial structure within
each country (p,0.001), the AIs are considerably higher (0.67
[0.62–0.73] and 0.55 [0.51–0.63] for Algeria and Morocco,
respectively) than those found for rabies at a larger spatial scale
(e.g., 0.087 [0.043–0.132] for the Africa 2 lineage in Central and
West Africa) [8], indicating weaker spatial structure at the within-
country level. The summaries of transitions to each location
generally identify multiple independent introductions of viruses in
each location from which several samples were obtained (Table 1).
Overall, the number of independent transitions to densely sampled
locations is lower in Morocco than Algeria, in agreement with the
lower AI for Morocco. Taken together with the strong spatial
structure across countries, these results suggest that a relatively
fluid RABV diffusion process within countries is restricted by
geopolitical boundaries at larger scales.
To identify the factors that may explain RABV spread, we
incorporated several potential predictors as relative diffusion rates
among each pair of locations, and tested these against equal rates
of diffusion. Specifically, we considered geographical distances
(great-circle distances), human population size, road distances and
spatial accessibility measures. Road distances were derived from
transport network data (Figure 2) and demonstrated a strong
correlation with great-circle distances (r = 0.96). More detailed
landscape features, which may imply multiple, direct and indirect
pathways connecting the different localities sampled in this study,
were represented by accessibility data. These data reflect the travel
time to the nearest major city using road/track-based travel [16]
and were less correlated with geographical distances (r = 0.61). We
employed circuit theory to translate the accessibility landscape into
an origin-destination distance matrix (the so-called ‘isolation by
resistance model’) [17]. We also tested a simple gravity model of
viral spread that, in the absence of real dog population sizes for the
locations involved, was based on human population sizes for the
discrete as a proxy. Finally, we also used population sizes in a
landscape approach, similar to accessibility measures, to construct
a population surface matrix [18].
Marginal likelihood estimates of the model fit of these different
predictors suggested that RABV spatial dynamics are best
described by road distances (Table 2). This was consistent across
both countries and again supports human-assisted dispersal of
rabies-infected dogs. As expected by their high correlation,
geographical distances provided only a marginally lower fit
compared to road distances. Only the population surface provided
inconsistent results between both countries; whereas this model
competes with road distances in Algeria, the population surface
did not provide a good fit to the Moroccan data (Figure S2 in
Supporting Information S1). Although accessibility did not seem to
explain RABV diffusion as well, we note that all samples were
obtained from relatively accessible parts of Morocco and Algeria.
To quantify and compare the dissemination process with
previous results, we estimated the rate of RABV gene flow among
the sampled isolates using ‘Markov jump’ counts [19] of location
state transitions and their reward-associated distances between
locations across each branch. The posterior average rate of viral
gene flow among localities estimated for Algeria was 26 km/yr
(95% highest probability density interval: 18–34) and 33 (23–43)
km/yr based on great circle distances and road distances,
respectively. Somewhat higher viral gene flow rate estimates were
obtained for Morocco with 42 (26–58) km/yr and 51 (34–72) km/
yr for great circle distances and road distances, respectively. We
note that the rates of viral gene flow estimated here are highly
dependent of the scale of sampling such that comparison may only
prove useful at the same geographic scale. However, these
estimates were 2.7 to 4.4 times higher than those recorded in
established enzootic situations in wildlife animals [9], again
suggestive of human-mediated transmission. Although it is
theoretically possible that these relatively high rates reflect
epidemic waves periodically moving through this geographical
region [20], particularly since similar rates have been observed in
wild carnivores during epidemic spread [9,10], such waves were
not observed in the geographical areas studied here and where the
virus appears to be largely enzootic.
Author Summary
At least 15 million doses of anti-rabies post-exposure
prophylaxis are administered annually worldwide, and an
estimated 55,000 people die of rabies every year. Over 99%
of these deaths occur in developing countries, predomi-
nantly in Asia and in Africa where rabies is endemic in
domestic dogs. Despite the global health burden due to
rabies, little is known about the patterns of the spread of
dog rabies in these endemic regions. We used recently
developed Bayesian analytical methods to unravel the
dynamics and determinants of the spatial diffusion of dog
rabies viruses in North Africa based on viral genetic data.
Our analysis reveals a combination of restricted spread
across administrative borders, the occasional long-distance
movement of rabies viruses, and a strong fit between
spatial spread of the virus and road distances between
localities. Together, these data indicate that by transport-
ing dogs, humans have played a key role in the dispersal of
a major animal pathogen. Our studies therefore provide
essential new information on the transmission dynamics of
rabies in Africa, and in doing so will greatly assist in future
intervention strategies.

The occasional mixing of sequences from different locations at
the tips of the inferred tree (Figure 1) is suggestive of long distance
spread in relatively little time (6 months to one year). To quantify
such rapid and long distance spread, we summarized the posterior
distribution of distances covered along individual branches
(Figure 3). We focused on branches along which inferred location
state changes occurred in a time period of less than 1 year, and
between 1 and 2 years. As a control, we analysed the branches
without inferred state changes; as expected these all had negligible
Markov jump count distances (not shown). Across the posterior
distribution of trees, we observed between 5 and 13 branches per
tree that have a time length less than 2 years and cover a distance
of more than 200 km, and 12 to 13 branches that cover a distance
of about 100 km (Figure 3). Importantly, our ability to clearly
detect long-distance movement is limited to branches representing
short evolutionary times; longer branches could also harbour such
events, providing an explanation for the relatively high average
rates of viral gene flow.

The rates of viral gene flow we estimate among the sampled
isolates from Algeria and Morocco contrast with those of spatial
RABV movement in an African dog population that should
experience very limited human-mediated dissemination of rabid
dogs [21]. In this case, the spatial dispersal of single RABV
infections was estimated to be predominantly less than 2 km (and
always smaller than 20 km). Considering that the average
incubation period of RABV is between 22 to 29 days
[20,21,22,23,24], it is clear that such long distances as those
recorded in our study could only be achieved with at least some
human intervention. To investigate more formally how the RABV
distribution we observe in Algeria and Morocco contrasts with the
patterns of spread we would expect from transmission dynamics in
African dogs alone (i.e. without human intervention), we simulated

a phylogeodynamic process based on epidemiological parameters
obtained from detailed analyses of rabies transmission biology
[20,21]. In particular, we considered epidemiologically informed
virus movement over all evolutionary histories in the posterior
distribution resulting from our phylodynamic inference (see
Supplementary Information). In our spatial simulation we analyze
cases in which (i) each new infection takes a random direction in
continuous space, or (ii) subsequent infections consistently take the
same direction (Figure 4). Although the latter may not be very
realistic, it should resemble virus movement along roads. For both
Algeria and Morocco, spatial diffusion is initiated at the centre of
the sampling locations, such that the process has the largest
probability to cover these locations a priori. When assuming up to
one year of movement these simulations clearly show that RABV
could not have spread to the same extent as shown by the current
sampling in Algeria and Morocco if the virus was simply being
transmitted by dog dispersal alone. Even if we enforce a year of
successive RABV transmissions in the same direction, which is
highly implausible given the observed dynamics of dog RABV in a
local setting [21], the simulations still do not attain the observed
spatial RABV spread. In addition, the distances realized by
dispersal in random directions along branches less than 2 years
were all less than 60 km, which is far more restricted than
estimated for the real data (Figure 3).
Rabies is a prime example of an infectious disease in which
dispersal can be exacerbated by animal movement mediated by
humans. This is illustrated by raccoon rabies in Virginia, USA [25],
dog rabies in Indonesia in Flores Island [26], in Bali (F.X. Meslin,
Personal communication) and in parts of Europe [27]. Each epidemic
resulted in enormous expenditure on rabies post exposure prophy-
laxis in humans and animal vaccination programs [28,29,30,31].
Importantly, our study allows us to quantify rates of viral gene flow
among sampled dog isolates (between 18 and 72 km/yr) in a mixed
geographic and socio-economic landscape, such as those character-
ized by Algeria and Morocco where there is currently little dog
vaccination. In addition, our analysis suggests that the human-
mediated dispersal of infected dogs is likely to continue to play a
major role in the transmission of RABV in geographical areas where
it has been present for many years. Indeed, our observations of
administrative borders that restrict a relatively fluid pattern of spread,
the occasional long-distance movement of viruses to particular
countries, and the fit between spatial dynamics and road distances, all
point to the displacement of rabies-infected dogs by humans.
Understanding the frequency and distance of movements of
potentially infected animals is of paramount importance in
predicting the spread of viral infections [32,33]. In addition, such
information has important implications for disease control;
understanding the conditions under which the containment of
wildlife [34] and dog rabies can reliably be achieved will assist in
the long term goal of eliminating animal RABV. In particular, that
humans mediate the transmission of RABV among dogs in North
Africa requires that intervention procedures are implemented
more rapidly than in situations in which humans play little or no
role in viral transmission. The high cost associated with
surveillance underscores the importance of sampling design and
the development of cost-effective monitoring and testing ap-

proaches [9,12,35]. In addition, this study illustrates the power of
phylogeographic approaches [8] to identify the factors responsible
for the spread of major animal and zoonotic pathogens. By
integrating spatial dynamics with temporal inferences, the
Bayesian analysis utilized here constitutes a powerful new tool
that may complement traditional epidemiological methods in
studying the effects of human behaviour on the evolution of
zoonotic viruses.
Materials and Methods
Data selection
The Office of Veterinary Public Health Services of the different
countries coordinates follow-up per animal bites. The respective
state health departments (in conjunction with qualified laboratories
that they designate) conduct all collection, observations, and
euthanization (if necessary) of animals suspected of rabies, according
to established national standardized protocols. A total of 287 isolates
sampled from Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Spain (Ceuta and
Melilla) were collected by the authors within the framework of these
qualified laboratories, and sequenced. These samples were collected
from dead animals suspected of rabies so that submission for
laboratory rabies diagnosis is mandatory. Spatial co-ordinates and
time of sampling, covering a period of 22 years (1986–2007), were
available for the majority of these isolates. Relevant epidemiological
information and GenBank accession numbers for all RABV isolates
analysed in this study are presented in Table S1 in Supporting
Information S1. All the locations sampled in this study experienced
cases every year. As such, our sampling does not focus on areas that
have been free of rabies in the recent past.

parent and daughter node) were binned according to the distance covered along that branch in Algeria (A) and Morocco (B). This was carried out
separately for branches along which state changes occurred in less than 1 year, and between 1 and 2 years.

To perform a reliable evolutionary analysis of dog RABV
circulating in North Africa, we aimed at selecting a genetic region
with sufficient phylogenetic information. To this end, we
sequenced a total of 3080 nt encompassing the N, P and intergenic
G-L region. Total RNA from the original brain samples was
extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. RT-PCRs and sequencing reactions
were performed as described previously [6,36]. All sequences
obtained have been deposited in GenBank (accession numbers
GU798102–GU798962).
Figure 4. Spatial simulation based on the inferred evolutionary histories and epidemiological parameters of rabies spread in
Algeria (A) and Morocco (B). We report the simulated spread using contours represented under the form of polygons. Different contours
represent different simulation scenarios: for time = 0.25 to time = 1.0, we force the virus to move consistently in the same direction for successive
transmissions during a time period of three months to one year. The dark green contour in the centre represents simulated spread with each
infection taking a new and random direction, while the increasingly lighter ones represent time = 0.25 to time = 1.0.

Bayesian evolutionary analyses of spatiotemporal RABV
dynamics
To investigate the evolutionary relationships and time to
common ancestry among RABV lineages circulating in north
Africa, we reconstructed the phylogenetic history for the entire
data set using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
analysis implemented in the BEAST package [13]. BEAST
incorporates sampling time information to estimate evolutionary
rates and a posterior distribution of time-scaled trees. We
employed a GTR model of nucleotide substitution with gamma-
distributed rate variation among sites and a relaxed (uncorrelated
log-normal) molecular clock model [39]. We specified a Bayesian
skyline plot model as flexible tree prior [40]. All chains were run
for a sufficient length and convergence was diagnosed using
Tracer (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/) ignoring 10%
of the chain as burn-in. Evolutionary history was summarized
using an annotated Maximum Clade Credibility (MCC) phyloge-
netic tree. Posterior probability values provide an assessment of the
degree of support for each node on the tree.
To reconstruct the spatial dynamics of dog-associated RABV
spread and investigate the role of different diffusion predictors in
shaping the epidemic in both Morocco and Algeria, we extracted
two data sets with their specific spatial and temporal co-ordinates:
(i) A total of 117 Algerian sequences (3080 nt) collected from dogs
in 20 cities over 7 years (from 2001 to 2008), and (ii) a total of 133
Moroccan sequences (3080 nt) sampled from dogs in 28 cities
between 2004 and 2008. For all these isolates precise dates (month)
of sampling and geographical localities (city) are available (Table
S2 in Supporting Information S1).
As an additional component in the fully probabilitistic
Bayesian inference framework, we consider a discretized
diffusion process among the sampling locations in both countries,
formalized as a continuous time Markov chain (CTMC) model
[8]. A CTMC is fully characterized using a matrix that describes
the rate of movement from location state i to j for every pair of
locations. To efficiently estimate the diffusion process from a
single observation (a single location realization for each
sequence), we restrict the parameterization to a sparse set of
rates that adequately explains the phylogeographic dispersal
process using Bayesian Stochastic search variable selection
(BSSVS). This BSSVS procedure also allows us to employ Bayes
factor testing in the identification of the most parsimonious
description of the diffusion process [8]. We used a modified
Association Index (AI) to assess the degree of spatial structure in
the phylogeographic data [8,15]. This reports the posterior
distribution of association values relative to those obtained by
randomizing the tip locations. In addition, we summarize the
number of transitions to each sampling location in the posterior
tree distribution based on the location realizations at the nodes.
The latter provide a conservative estimate of the number of
independent introductions in each location.
To quantify the dissemination process, we estimated the rate of
rabies spread among the sampled isolates using ‘Markov jump’
counts [19] of location state transitions for all possible states along
the phylogeny. Markov jump counts measure the expected
number of transitions along each branch conditional on the
observed data. By multiplying the expected number of transitions
between each pair of locations by the geographical distance
between these two locations, we arrive at the expected distance
travelled within the time elapsed on each branch. This approach,
implemented in BEAGLE [41] a library that can be used in
conjunction with BEAST), integrates over all uncertainty in the
evolutionary tree and offers a degree of robustness to model
misspecification [42].
To test different scenarios of phylogeographic diffusion, we fix
the CTMC relative rate parameters to the normalized pairwise
location measures that represent different diffusion predictors
and perform Bayesian model selection using marginal likelihood
approximations [43]. We consider; (i) geographical distances,
specifically great-circle distances that represent the shortest path
on the surface of the Earth between two points, (ii) human
population size, obtained from http://en.wikipedia.org/ and
http://www.mongabay.com (Table S3 in Supporting Informa-
tion S1, rates between each pair of locations were fixed to the
normalized products of the population sizes), (iii) road distances,
(iv) a gravity model, (v) spatial accessibility, and (vi) ‘population
conductivity’ measures. The accessibility estimates are derived
from a range of spatial data sets, road type and network data [44],
satellite derived and cover information, settlement database
locations and sizes, and satellite derived topography. They are
combined to create a ‘friction surface’ where each 161 km
square represents the difficulty (or travel time) in crossing it.
These estimates provide a representation of the difficulty in travel
between all the locations. Using a circuit theory approach, an
origin-destination distance matrix was estimated from this
accessibility landscape [17]. A simple gravity model was
constructed by fixing the rates to the normalized product of the
population sizes divided by the great circle distance between the
locations involved. As an alternative, population sizes were also
mapped in a landscape (Figure S2 in Supporting Information S1)
[18] and again translated to an origin-destination distance matrix
using circuit theory. To assess model fit, marginal likelihood
approximations are obtained using an importance sampling
estimator [43,45], which employs a mixture of model prior and
posterior samples [46].
Spatial simulation
To contrast the spatial distribution of our rabies samples in
Algeria and Morocco with the patterns of spread we would
expect from local transmission dynamics in African dogs as the
sole maintenance population, we performed a simulation
analysis that integrates phylodynamic and epidemiological
parameters. Specifically, we consider a spatial process based
on epidemiological parameters obtained from a detailed
analysis of rabies transmission biology in African dogs [20],
and simulate virus movement accordingly over all evolutionary
histories in the posterior distribution resulting from our
phylodynamic inference. The latter characterizes the successful
ancestral transmission history of the viruses we sampled and
provides a time-scale for the spatial process we would like to
simulate.
For each tree in the posterior distribution, we consider the
ancestral virus at the root to start spreading from the mid-point of
our available samples (average of longitudes and latitudes). We
recursively visit all branches from root to tip, each time simulating
a number of successive infections, which jointly encompass the
entire time length for each branch. Each time interval t (in days)

between successive infections follows:
t~azfb ð1Þ
where a is a random incubation time, b is the random period of
infectiousness, and f is a random fraction drawn from a
uniform[0,1] distribution. Following the results of the compre-
hensive study by Hampson et al. [21], we consider
a *
idd
gamma 1:1,20:1
ð Þ ð2Þ
and
b *
idd
gamma 3:0,0:9
ð Þ: ð3Þ
Each new infection is moved a random distance d (in m) away
from its source case; the distribution for d follows a previously
described spatial infection kernel [21]:
d *
idd
gamma 0:2,4079:4
ð Þ ð4Þ
In the spatial simulation process, we assume that each new
distance takes a random direction in continuous space, but we also
explore subsequent infections consistently taking the same
direction. To achieve a realistic distribution in the relevant
geographic area, we prohibit new infections to invade water areas.
The tree heights used for simulation for Algeria and Morocco were
33 (23–46) years and 28 (18–39) years respectively (as estimated
from the country-specific data), whereas the tree lengths
encompassed 623 (490–789) years and 532 (367–706) years
respectively.
This simulation procedure yields location realizations in
continuous space for all tips and all trees in the posterior
distribution. We summarize this spatial distribution using two-
dimensional contours. Because the spatial simulation for each tree
in the posterior distribution may cover a different area, it is
important to note that the contour representing the process over
all trees depicts the maximum area that can be covered for the set
of epidemiological parameters we consider.
