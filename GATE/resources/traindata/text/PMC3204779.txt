Genetic Detection
of Dobrava/
Belgrade Virus,
Bulgaria
To the Editor: Hantaviruses
(family Bunyaviridae, genus Hanta-
virus) cause 2 clinical syndromes in
humans: hemorrhagic fever with renal
syndrome (HFRS) in the Old World
and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome
in the New World (1). Humans are
infected by inhaling the excreta of in-
fected rodents. Persons at increased
risk for infection are farmers, loggers/
forest workers, and soldiers.
Bulgaria is a country in southeast-
ern Europe with 8 million inhabitants.
Two types of hemorrhagic fevers are
endemic to Bulgaria: Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic fever and HFRS. Both
diseases have been subject to manda-
tory reporting since 1953. During the
past decade, 36 cases of HFRS have
been reported, mainly in the areas of
the Balkan and Rila-Pirin-Rodopa
mountain ranges in southwestern Bul-
garia. Diagnosis was based on clinical
symptoms and serologic test results.
We report 3 HFRS cases, 2 of which
were fatal. Apart from serologic diag-
nosis,geneticdetectionofhantaviruses
was also achieved, resulting in gaining
insight into the genetic relationships
of hantavirus sequences from Bulgaria
with respective sequences retrieved in
neighboring countries.
On September 2, 2009, high fe-
ver, chills, headache, and myalgia
developed in a 21-year-old man who
lived in Simitli town (Blagoevgrad
Province, southwestern Bulgaria).
Five days after symptom onset, he
was admitted to the regional hospital
of Blagoevgrad. His condition rap-
idly deteriorated. Clinical signs were
pharyngeal hyperemia, oliguria, and
febrile toxic syndrome. The patient
became hypotensive, reporting ab-
dominal pain in the liver and spleen.
Laboratory findings showed the fol-
lowing: leukocyte count 11.8 × 109
cells/L, hematocrit 51%, blood he-
moglobin 161 g/L, platelet count 10 ×
109
cells/L, aspartate aminotransfer-
ase (AST) 118 U/L, alanine amino-
transferase (ALT) 89 U/L, urea 26.4
mmol/L, and creatinine 501 μmol/L.
An echograph showed enlarged kid-
neys, liver, spleen, and pancreas, and
abdominal and bilateral pleural effu-
sions. Urine analysis disclosed pro-
teinuria and microscopic hematuria.
The patient was admitted with acute
renal failure and multiple organ in-
sufficiency. Despite multiple blood
transfusions and hemodialysis, he
died 14 days after hospitalization.
On April 9, 2010, a 54-year-old
man, a resident of Kirkovo village
(Kardjali Province, southern Bul-
garia), was admitted to the regional
hospital in Kardjali City with a 7-day
history of fever, weakness, and my-
algia in the lower extremities and a
4-day history of abdominal pain and
diarrhea. At admission, physical ex-
amination showed skin petechiae,
subconjunctival and gingival hemor-
rhages, and oliguria. Laboratory find-
ings showed the following: leukocyte
count of 23 × 109
cells/L, platelet
count of 50 × 109
cells/L, AST 96 U/L,
ALT 167 U/L, urea 58.7 mmol/L, and
creatinine 1,033 μmol/L. Urea and
creatinine levels continued to rise.
Proteinurua and hematuria were pres-
ent. After 3 sessions of hemodyalisis,
the patient gradually improved, and he
was discharged without sequelae.
On May 7, 2010, a 28-year-old
man, a resident of Smilyan village,
(Smolyan Province, southern Bul-
garia) was admitted to the Infectious
Diseases Clinic in Smolyan Regional
Hospital with a 4-day history of fe-
ver, vomiting, and diarrhea. Physical
examination on admission showed
skin petechiae and gingival hemor-
rhages. Laboratory findings showed
the following: leukocyte count of 6 ×
109
cells/L, platelet count of 50 × 109
cells/L, urea 10.5 mmol/L, creatinine
230 mmol/L, AST 1697 U/L, and ALT
1,119 U/L. Proteinuria and hematuria
were present. The patient became an-
uric and underwent hemodialysis. On
May 9, the patient died.
Serum samples from these 3 pa-
tients were tested for immunoglobulin
(Ig) G and IgM against Hantaan virus
(HTNV) and Puumala virus by ELISA
(Progen, Biotechnik GmbH, Heidel-
berg, Germany). High titers of HTNV
IgM were detected in all 3 patients; in
1 patient HTNV IgG was also detect-
ed; antibodies against Puumala virus
were not detected. Thus, a HTNV-like
infection was suggested.
Viral RNA was extracted from
the earliest available serum sample,
and a 1-step SYBR Green real time
reverse transcription–PCR (RT-PCR)
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) (2)
and 2 nested RT-PCRs amplifying par-
tial small (S) and medium (M) RNA
segments were applied (3,4). Do-
brava/Belgrade virus (DOBV) RNA
was detected by RT-PCR. Sequenc-
ing and phylogenetic analysis of the
nested RT-PCR products showed that
the causative agent in all 3 cases was
DOBV (Figure).
Sequences were submitted to Gen-
Bank under accession nos. HQ174468–
HQ174473. Bulgarian sequences clus-
ter with respective sequences retrieved
from Apodemus flavicollis mouse tis-
sues or from HFRS cases from central
and southeastern Europe. Briefly, the
closest genetic strains in S and M RNA
segments are strains isolated from A.
flavicollis mice in northeastern Greece,
near the border with Bulgaria (5). The
genetic difference at nucleotide level
among the Bulgarian strains is 1.2%–
2.1% and 2.2%–7.4% in the S and M
segments, respectively.
HFRS is endemic to the Bal-
kan Peninsula. Severe HFRS cases
caused by DOBV have been reported
in Greece (4–6), Slovenia (7,8), Ser-
bia and Montenegro (9), the Czech
Republic (3), and Hungary (10). Our
results confirm that DOBV also cir-
culates in Bulgaria and causes severe
HFRS cases; thus, clinicians have to
include HFRS in differential diagnosis

of febrile cases accompanied by acute
nephropathy. Further studies on pa-
tients and small mammals in Bulgaria
will elucidate the hantavirus epidemi-
ology in this Balkan region.

A226V Strains of
Chikungunya Virus,
Réunion Island,
2010
To the Editor: Chikungunya vi-
rus (CHIKV) first emerged in Indian
Ocean islands off the eastern coast of
Africa in 2005 and was responsible for
large-scale epidemics on the islands of
Réunion, Comoros, Mayotte, Mau-
ritius, Madagascar, and Seychelles
(1–4). On Réunion Island, a French
overseas territory of 810,000 inhabit-
ants, herd immunity reached 38% in
October 2006 (5). Molecular epide-
miology of the strain responsible for
these outbreaks indicated that it had
originated in Kenya (6). The epidemic
on Réunion Island was associated with
a mutation in the envelope protein
gene (E1-A226V) that improves rep-
lication and transmission efficiency in
Aedes albopictus mosquitoes (7).
Since 2006, the Regional Office of
the French Institute for Public Health
Surveillance in the Indian Ocean has
conducted epidemiologic and biologi-
cal surveillance for CHIKV infection.
Case definitions have been described
(8). During December 2006–July
2009, no confirmed case was detected

Figure. Phylogenetic trees based on a 560-bp fragment of the small RNA segment (A) and
a 224-bp fragment of the medium RNA segment (B) of hantaviruses. Hantaan virus (HTNV)
was used as the outgroup. The numbers at the nodes indicate percentage bootstrap
replicates of 100; values <60% are not shown. Horizontal distances are proportional to
the nucleotide differences. Sequences in the tree are indicated as GenBank accession
number, strain name, country. Strains from this study are shown in boldface. Scale bars
indicate 10% nucleotide sequence divergence.
