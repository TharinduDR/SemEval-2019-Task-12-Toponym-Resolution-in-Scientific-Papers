In July 2004, an outbreak of influenza A (H3N2) was
detected at 3 Bhutanese refugee camps in southeastern
Nepal. Hemagglutination inhibition showed that ≈40% of
the viruses from this outbreak were antigenically distinct
from the A/Wyoming/3/03 vaccine strain. Four amino acid
differences were observed in most of the 26 isolates com-
pared with the A/Wyoming/3/2003 vaccine strain. All 4 sub-
stitutions are located within or adjacent to known
antibody-binding sites. Several isolates showed a lysine-to-
asparagine substitution at position 145 (K145N) in the
hemagglutinin molecule, which may be noteworthy since
position 145 is located within a glycosylation site and adja-
cent to an antibody-binding site. H3N2 viruses continue to
drift from the vaccine strain and may remain as the domi-
nant strains during the 2005–2006 influenza season. Thus,
the 2005–2006 Northern Hemisphere vaccine strain was
changed to A/California/7/2004, a virus with all 4 amino
acid substitutions observed in these Nepalese isolates.
The 2003–2004 influenza season was severe in terms of
its impact on illness because of widespread circulation
of antigenically distinct influenza A (H3N2) Fujian-like
viruses. These viruses first appeared late during the
2002–2003 influenza season and continued to persist as the
dominant circulating strain throughout the subsequent
2003–2004 influenza season, replacing the
A/Panama/2007/99-like H3N2 viruses (1). Of the 172
H3N2 viruses genetically characterized by the Department
of Defense in 2003–2004, only 1 isolate (from Thailand)
belonged to the A/Panama-like lineage. In February 2003,
the World Health Organization (WHO) changed the H3N2
component for the 2004–2005 influenza vaccine to afford
protection against the widespread emergence of Fujian-
like viruses (2). The annually updated trivalent vaccine
consists of hemagglutinin (HA) surface glycoprotein com-
ponents from influenza H3N2, H1N1, and B viruses.
The HA1 segment of the influenza HA protein is the
most rapidly evolving gene product (3) and plays a major
role in viral attachment and evasion from the adaptive
immune response. Previous studies have demonstrated 5
antigenic sites on the HA1 polypeptide where antibody
binding can occur (4,5). Additionally, several studies have
documented specific immunodominant codons correspon-
ding to specific amino acids of the HA protein that are
directly involved in the divergence of antigenically distinct
influenza viruses (6–8).
In July 2004, an outbreak of influenza A (H3N2) was
detected in patients at 3 Bhutanese refugee camps in south-
eastern Nepal. To elucidate the molecular mechanism
underlying the emergence of this H3N2 outbreak, we con-
ducted a molecular analysis of the HA1 region of the HA
protein. In this report, we describe the epidemiologic and
molecular aspects of isolates obtained from this off-season
influenza A (H3N2) outbreak.
Materials and Methods
Sample Collection and Antigenic Analysis
Sixty-four patients in Nepal that met US Department of
Defense enrollment criteria (9) for influenzalike illness
were evaluated by using onsite rapid influenza tests
(Optical Immunoassay Rapid Diagnostic Tests, Thermo
Electron Corp., San Jose, CA, USA) according to the man-
ufacturer’s instructions. Throat swab specimens were col-
lected within the first 72 hours of onset of symptoms,
routed through the Armed Forces Research Institute for
Medical Sciences in Bangkok, Thailand, and shipped on
dry ice to Brooks City Base in San Antonio, Texas, for
clinical characterization and diagnosis using traditional
culturing techniques and monoclonal antibody staining
(10). Antigenic analysis of select isolates was performed at

Molecular Analysis
RNA was extracted from 48-hour shell vial cultures
(10) by using the MagnaPure LX (Roche Molecular,
Mannheim, Germany) and RNA Isolation Kit II (Roche
Molecular) according to the manufacturer’s protocols. For
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
amplification, 5 µL RNA was added to a 50-µL master
mixture containing 1× reaction buffer, 1.6 mmol/L MgSO4,
1× enzyme mixture, and 400 nmol/L primers (H3-F7, 5′-
ACT-ATC-ATT-GCT-TTG-AGC-3′ and H3R-1184, 5′-
ATG-GCT-GCT-TGA-GTG-CTT-3′) by using the
SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR System (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA). PCR thermocycling consisted of an
RT step at 50°C for 30 min, hot start activation at 95°C for
3 min, followed by 40 amplification cycles of 95°C for 30
s, 52°C for 15 s, and 68°C for 1 min, with a final extension
cycle at 68°C for 7 min. All PCR products were visualized
after electrophoresis in 2% precast gels stained with ethid-
ium bromide (Invitrogen) under UV illumination. PCR
products were purified by using the PCR Purification Kit
(Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA, USA). The HA1 amplicon
(1177 bp) was sequenced by using the H3-F7 and H3R-
1184 PCR primers (described above) and 2 additional
internal oligonucleotides, H3R-466 (5′-GGT-GCA-ACC-
AAT-TCA-ATC-3′) and H3F-282 (5′-CAG-CAA-CTG-
TTA-CCC-3′). Unincorporated fluorescent nucleotides
were removed by using a Dye Ex 96-well plate kit
(Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s recommenda-
tions. Nucleotide sequencing was performed by using the
Big Dye Terminator v3.1 Kit and analyzed by using an
ABI 3100 Genetic Analyzer (both from Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) according to the man-
ufacturer’s specifications. Multiple sequence alignments,
protein translation, and phylogenetic analysis were per-
formed with the DNAStar (DNAStar Inc., Madison, WI,
USA) software package. Three-dimensional HA protein
structures were generated by using MOLMOL (12) and the
Swiss-PDB Viewer programs (13). HA nucleotide
sequences for all 26 Nepal isolates depicted in the phylo-
genetic analysis are available from GenBank under acces-
sion nos. AY945263–AY945288.
Results
Epidemiologic and Laboratory Assessment
Clinical evaluations and throat specimens were
obtained from 64 patients from 3 refugee camps in south-
eastern Nepal (Figure 1). Of the 64 patients, 61 were
refugees from Bhutan, 1 was a foreign aid worker from
Japan, and 2 were Nepalese nationals. Most of the patients
were <10 years of age; 36 were male and 28 were female.
None had previously been vaccinated against influenza
and of the 64 specimens collected, 42 (66%) tested posi-
tive for influenza A by culture.
Antigenic Analysis
HI was performed by using postinfection ferret antisera
with reference antigens that included the 2004–2005
H3N2 vaccine seed strain (A/Wyoming/03/2003) and the
2005–2006 Southern Hemisphere H3N2 vaccine strain
(A/Wellington/1/2004). When compared with A/
Wyoming/03/2003, 4 of 9 Nepal isolates showed 4-fold
lower titers (1:320 versus 1:1,280 HI units) than that
allowed for homologous titer of the reference antisera.
This indicated that these 4 isolates were antigenically dis-
tinct. Six of 9 Nepal isolates were antigenically distinct

when compared with the A/Wellington/1/2004 strain and
showed a 4-fold (1:160 versus 1:640) reduction in titer to
ferret antisera (Table 1).
Molecular Analysis
RT-PCR-based molecular subtyping showed that all 42
specimens were the H3N2 influenza subtype. Twenty-six
of the 42 influenza A–positive samples were randomly
selected for molecular characterization using direct
nucleotide sequencing of the HA gene. The 26 Nepal iso-
lates exhibited 99.8% nucleotide sequence identity and
contained the Fujian-like amino acid substitutions at posi-
tions 155 (H155T) and 156 (Q156H) in the HA protein
(Table 2). Alignment of the 329–amino acid HA protein
from 26 isolates obtained from this outbreak with the
2004/05 A/Wyoming/3/03 vaccine strain and previous
H3N2 vaccine strains indicated 4 evident amino acid
changes present in most of the isolates (Table 2). All 4
amino acid changes observed within most of these out-
break isolates are present within A/California/7/04, a vari-
ant strain selected as the H3N2 vaccine strain for the
2005–2006 influenza season.
Of the 26 Nepal strains examined, 24 exhibited a novel
lysine-to-asparagine substitution at position 145 in the HA
protein (K145N). This substitution is noteworthy because
most strains characterized in 2003–2004, including the
Fujian/411/2002 vaccine strain, contained a lysine (K) at
this position. Prior to this outbreak, the US Department of
Defense had only observed K145N substitutions in 6
strains obtained from Ramstein, Germany, (data not
shown) in June 2004. Additionally, all 26 Nepal sequences
exhibited a serine-to-asparagine substitution at position
189 (S189N) that had also been observed in the 6 isolates
from Germany, as well as in a few isolates from Asia char-
acterized at the end of the 2003–2004 influenza season.
Two other substitution mutations in the HA1 hemagglu-
tinin, i.e., valine to isoleucine at position 226 (V226I) and
serine to proline at position 227 (S227P), were also
observed in 24 (92%) and 26 of 26 of the Nepal isolates,
respectively. Both substitutions differ from most influenza
A H3N2 field isolates collected in 2003–2004, including
the Fujian and Wyoming vaccine strain for 2004–2005
(Table 2).
The phylogeny of H3N2 HA proteins indicates a drift-
ing of the Nepal isolates from the A/Fujian/411/03 and
A/Wyoming/03/03 vaccine strains and shows that these
outbreak isolates have a higher genetic homology to
A/Wellington/1/04, a prototype strain selected as the
2005–2006 Southern Hemisphere H3 vaccine strain
(Figure 2). The A/Wellington/1/04 strain contains 2 of the
4 amino acid changes (S227P and S189N) observed in the
Nepal isolates, but does not contain the K145N and V226I
substitutions.
Three-dimensional views of influenza HA proteins
highlighting amino acid changes in a representative Nepal
isolate and the A/Wyoming/3/03 vaccine strains are shown
in Figure 3A and B, respectively. The mutation at position
145 (shown in yellow), which is located adjacent to anti-
body-binding site A and within a known glycosylation site,
introduces an asparagine-for-lysine substitution. This sub-
stitution results in a more accessible receptor-binding cleft
located directly above residue 145 (comparing panels A
and B). Located above the receptor-binding pocket is a ser-
ine-to-asparagine change (shown in green) that possibly
alters the regional surface topography at position 189 with-
in antibody-binding site B. A serine-to-proline mutation at
RESEARCH
1188 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 11, No. 8, August 2005
position 227 (shown in magenta) appears to marginally
affect the HA surface features. This substitution resides
within antibody-binding site D, which corresponds to
residues 225–228, which make up the left side of the
receptor-binding pocket (14). Interestingly, this proline
residue is located within a β barrel (a protein motif consist-
ing of an antiparallel β sheet domain) and does not appre-
ciably alter the predicted protein structure, as shown by the
absence of any substantial changes in the computer-mod-
eled, 3-dimensional structure compared with the HA1 of
A/Wyoming/3/2003.
Discussion
The 4 substitutions described represent a growing line-
age of influenza A (H3N2) viruses characterized since July
2004. Three amino acid changes are confined within
known antibody-binding sites, i.e., the S189N change
within antibody-binding site B (4,5) and the V226I and
S227P changes residing in antibody-binding site D (4,5).
Because of rotational restrictions, a proline substitution at
position 227 (S227P) would typically give rise to consid-
erable conformation change; however, this particular sub-
stitution is located within a β barrel motif and therefore has
little effect on regional protein conformation.
Cumulatively, field isolates characterized subsequent to
this outbreak continue to exhibit these 4 changes, and they
appear to constitute a distinct branch in the phylogeny of
HA sequences when compared with H3N2 isolates from
the 2003–2004 season.
The K145N mutation represents a change from a
charged to uncharged amino acid R group. This change
may affect protein-protein interactions since it is immedi-
ately adjacent to antibody-binding site A, where neutraliz-
ing antibodies have been shown to bind (4,5).
Furthermore, since the K145N substitution is located with-
in a glycosylation site, the charge alteration may affect gly-
cosyl transferase activity, which results in altered
glycosylation. Differences in glycosylation have been
shown to contribute to antigenic variation by preventing
antibody binding to antigenic sites (15). Additionally, 3-

Nepal isolates have drifted from the

(and A/Wyoming/03/03 vaccine seed
strain) and are genetically equivalent to
A/California/7/04, the 2005–2006
Northern Hemisphere vaccine strain. A
K145N substitution (branch point indicated
by the arrow) was observed in 24 of 26
Nepal isolates and represents a genetic
marker for the dominant lineage of H3N2
viruses during the 2004–2005 season.

dimensional analysis suggests this amino acid substitution
may also promote enhanced receptor binding since the
asparagine R group is shorter, which may make binding
requirements less stringent and the receptor cleft more
accessible. The 3-dimensional depiction provides a unique
regional residue perspective, demonstrating how the rapid-
ly evolving HA surface antigens in the vaccine strain dif-
fer at the molecular level. These changes are consistent
with both antigenic and genetic data.
Collectively, the clinical isolates obtained from this
outbreak in Nepal cannot be considered antigenically dis-
tinct from the A/Wyoming/3/03 vaccine strain because
only 4 of 9 isolates evaluated exhibited 4-fold lower titers
by HI (Table 1). Furthermore, the varying reactivity noted
in several isolates from this outbreak having identical HA1
sequences is suggestive that other viral antigens aside from
the HA1 protein may have contributed to the antigenic
variability observed in the HI panel.
With the exception of A/Nepal/1670/2004 and
A/Nepal/1672/2004, all isolates evaluated by HI (Table 1)
exhibited identical HA1 amino acid sequences and varying
antigenicity profiles to A/Wyoming/03/2003 reference
antisera. One explanation for this observation is that genet-
ic differences in other influenza surface proteins contribute
to the observed immunoreactivity. Alternative viral surface
protein candidates include the neuraminidase, HA2, and
M2 glycoproteins, which have been shown to exhibit anti-
genic properties (16–19).
In this report, we describe the genetic analysis of the
HA proteins from viruses obtained from an early season
outbreak and compare them to current vaccine strains.
Three amino acids changes (S189N, I226V, and S227P)
were noted in known (4,5) antibody-binding sites (Table
2). The fourth change (K145N), which was located within
a glycosylation site, may enhance viral binding since the
smaller asparagine R group is located close to the HA
receptor-binding cleft (Figure 3). Phylogenetic analyses
show that the Nepal isolates make up a distinct branch in
the evolution of H3N2 viruses when they are compared
with vaccine and reference strains (Figure 2). However,
antigenic data appear more ambiguous, suggesting a multi-
genic effect that cannot solely be attributed to properties of
the influenza HA (Table 1). Studies are in progress to char-
acterize the neuraminidase, M2, and HA2 proteins to
determine the molecular basis responsible for antigenicity
differences observed within isolates from this outbreak.
The K145N substitution change has become a marker
for an increasingly large subset of the Fujian-like viruses.
CDC and the US Department of Defense have recently
characterized viruses with the K145N change in
Singapore, Taiwan, China, Australia, Canada, and the
United States. In February 2005, WHO reported the emer-
gence of a new influenza H3N2 strain in the United States.
The A/California/7/2004 strain, which was first identified
in the United States in September 2004, contains all 4
changes observed in isolates from this Nepalese outbreak.
The A/California/7/2004 strain differs by only 1 amino
acid in HA1 (which is of no immunologic importance)
from most isolates from the outbreak in Nepal. All viruses
characterized (≈150 globally isolated strains) subsequent
to the preparation of this report (March 2005) by the US
Department of Defense are genetically similar in amino
acid sequence to these Nepalese strains (and the
A/California strain). Most of the isolates (80%) analyzed
by CDC since October 2004 are antigenically related to
A/California (20), which indicates that this strain has
emerged as the dominant influenza A H3N2 strain. These
data indicate that these viruses may persist as the dominant
strain at the onset of the 2005–2006 influenza season. In
February 2005, WHO recommended inclusion of an
A/California/7/2004-like strain in the 2005–2006 trivalent
influenza vaccine to afford immunologic protection from
