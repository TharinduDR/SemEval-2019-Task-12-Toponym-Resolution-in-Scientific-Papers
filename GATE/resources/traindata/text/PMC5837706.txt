Why was the cohort set up?
Population ageing is affecting low- and middle-income
countries, with absolute and relative numbers of older
adults increasing quickly across the globe. This demographic transition is accompanied by a health transition,
driven by changing habits and lifestyles, where non-communicable diseases are becoming the major cause of morbidity. Dementia is strongly associated with age and is one
of the main contributors to dependence and disability. It
has been estimated that there are nearly 47 million people
currently living with dementia, most of whom live in lowand middle-income countries (LMICs).
The title of the 10/66 Dementia Research Group
(DRG) reflects the fact that, when the group was formed
in 1998, less than 10% of population-based research on
dementia had been carried out in developing countries although two-thirds of those affected lived in those settings.1 The 10/66 DRG research programme was

developed to address this inequity, quantifying dementia
prevalence, incidence and impact across Latin American
countries, China and India, using a validated and common methodology. However, given that this was a population cohort, the scope of the research was much broader
than this—entailing a comprehensive enquiry into health
(common and burdensome chronic diseases, disability
and health service utilization), and social aspects of ageing (socioeconomic status, social protection, needs for
care and care arrangements).
Fundamental methodological issues, in particular the
development, calibration and validation of culture- and
education-fair dementia diagnosis, and care arrangements
for care-dependent older people, were addressed in pilot
investigations in 26 centres from 16 low- and middle-income countries in Latin America and the Caribbean,
Africa, India, Russia, China and South East Asia (1999–
2001).2–5 The protocols for the 10/66 DRG baseline

surveys and incidence phase surveys have already been
described in detail in a previous publication.6 The purpose
of this paper is to describe in more detail the resources created through these completed surveys, together with findings from the research completed to date and further plans
for development of this resource.

Where is it located, who set it up and how
has it been funded?
The 10/66 DRG is coordinated from London, within the
Centre for Global Mental Health at King’s College
London, with a network of centres each led by a local
principal investigator. The 10/66 DRG’s research has
been funded by the Wellcome Trust Health Consequences
of Population Change Programme (GR066133—
Prevalence phase in Cuba and Brazil; GR08002—
Incidence phase in Peru, Mexico, Cuba, Dominican
Republic, Venezuela and China), World Health
Organization (India, Dominican Republic and China),
the US Alzheimer’s Association (IIRG–04–1286—Peru
and Mexico), FONACIT/ CDCH/ UCV (Venezuela), and
Puerto Rico Legislature (data collection in Puerto Rico)
and Pfizer Co., USA (blood sample collection in Puerto
Rico). The new cohort is funded by a European Research
Council Advanced Grant (340755). The Rockefeller
Foundation supported our dissemination strategy meeting
at their Bellagio Centre. Alzheimer Disease International
(ADI) has provided support for networking and
infrastructure.

population and with agriculture and related trades as the
main local employment, were located in Peru (Canete
Province), Mexico (Morelos State) and China (Daxing,
Beijing Province). The centre and site characteristics are
summarized in Figure 1. The baseline phase was conducted for all centres between 2004 and 2006, with the
exception of Puerto Rico where baseline data were collected between 2007 and 2010 (Figure 2). Mapping of the
catchment areas was carried out within specified boundaries, and households were allocated household identification numbers. Enumeration was carried out by
door-knocking all households in the catchment area to
identify potentially eligible participants (those aged 65
years or over on a census date) who were then allocated
participant identification numbers. These are linked to
names and addresses in secure databases held in London.
Participants’ ages were confirmed during the interview.
Information about the age and sex of all other coresidents was also recorded. After verifying eligibility,
written consent was obtained from participants or next of
kin if the individual lacked capacity. Oral consent, witnessed in writing by someone literate, was taken from illiterate participants. An overall sample of 2000 per
country would allow estimation of a typical dementia
prevalence of 4.5% with a precision of 6 0.9%, and rural
and urban samples of 1000 each would allow estimation
of the same prevalence with a precision of 6 1.2%.
A sample size of around 2000 individuals for each country was achieved and the response rate was excellent in
most catchment areas, with a range of 72 % to 98% by
site, and an average across sites of 86% (Table 1).

Who is in the cohort?
The 10/66 cohort is a population cohort comprising in
principle all older residents aged 65 years and over, living
in 11 geographically defined urban and rural catchment
area sites in eight low- and middle-income countries. The
selection of catchment areas for the baseline phase of the
survey was purposive, based upon their accessibility, their
use in the past as field sites for community or population
research and the existence of or potential for development
of good relationships between the local research groups
and community stakeholders. Urban sites were selected to
comprise mixed or mainly lower socioeconomic status
households; exclusively high-income or professional districts were excluded. Urban sites were located in Cuba
(one catchment area comprising sites is Havana and
Matanzas), Dominican Republic (Santo Domingo),
Puerto Rico (Bayamon), Venezuela (Caracas), Peru
(Lima), Mexico (Mexico City), China (Xicheng, Beijing
province) and India (Chennai). Rural sites, selected to be
remote from major population centres, with low-density

The completed cohort resource
The cohort at baseline, with respect to vital status ascertained through to March 2014, comprised 15 901 participants at risk (Table 1; and Supplementary Table 1,
available as Supplementary data at IJE online). The median follow-up period ranged from 2.8 to 5.0 years by site,
with a total of 53 872 person-years of observation. The
vital status of 13 936 participants (87.7%) was determined, with 2602 deaths occurring during the follow-up
period, for which 2436 verbal autopsy interviews were
completed. The proportion deceased at follow-up was
higher in China, Dominican Republic and Cuba than in
other countries (in part a function of the longer follow-up
interval in those sites). With respect to the incidence of dementia (further excluding India, where dementia-free participants were not followed up), 14 896 participants were
interviewed at baseline, 13 483 free of dementia; 9322 (69.
1%) were re-interviewed, contributing 42 698 person-years
of follow-up.

Figure 2 Cohort diagram of the baseline and follow-up surveys; 2nd wave numbers refer to number of people with a determined vital status.

How often have they been followed up?
Participants of the baseline assessment were traced and followed up between 2007 and 2010 in the China, India
(mortality only), Cuba, Dominican Republic, Mexico,
Peru and Venezuela sites, and between 2012 and 2013 in
Puerto Rico. In India, all those with mild cognitive impairment, ‘cognitive impairment no dementia’ (CIND) or dementia at baseline completed the full incidence phase
protocol, to determine the predictive validity of baseline
dementia diagnosis.7 A mortality sweep was carried out on
the full baseline cohort to determine vital status, date of
death of those deceased and a verbal autopsy on those
deceased.8

Subsequent to the baseline and incidence waves, the 10/
66 INDEP sub-study has been completed,9 a nested study
of households in Peru, Mexico and China, characteriszd as
‘incident care’, ‘chronic care’ or ‘no care’, depending upon
the needs for care of older residents. This focuses on the
economic and social functioning of the household as a
whole. A third full wave of assessment using an extended
form of the basic 10/66 survey has recently been planned
and funded for Cuba, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico,
Mexico, Peru, Venezuela and China, which will take place
approximately 10 years on from the original baseline surveys (2015–16).This will be a new prevalence sweep, with
renewed -door-knocking of the original catchment areas to

generate a new representative prevalence sample of all
those aged 65 years and over, including those that have
aged to 65 years or over since the first prevalence wave,
and in-migrants. Participants of the original baseline survey will be traced and have their vital status ascertained,
and be re-interviewed where possible even if migrated out
of the area.

What has been measured?
The same cross-culturally validated assessment was carried
out across each centre, during the baseline and follow-up
phase of the study. All participants underwent a comprehensive interview, including a structured interview, a physical examination and an informant interview. Key
informants were selected by interviewers on the basis of
who knew the old person best and could give the clearest
and most detailed account of their current circumstances.
Co-residents and family members were prioritized unless
others were clearly better qualified. The main criterion for
selection in case of several co-resident family members was
time spent with the older person. In cases where the older
person needed care, then the main caregiver was selected.
However, if the main caregiver was paid, the main organizational caregiver was selected instead.
Each full assessment, which lasted between 2 and 3 h,
was translated, back-translated and adapted as necessary
into the different languages for each centre (Table 2).

structured Geriatric Mental State clinical interview
(GMS);11–13 (iii) Hypertension according to European
Society of Hypertension criteria (systolic blood pressure
> ¼ 140 mmHg
and/or
diastolic
blood
pressure
> ¼ 95 mmHg, and/or a positive answer to the question
‘have you ever been told by a doctor that you have hypertension?’); (iv) Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
(COPD) diagnosed in those who responded ‘yes’ to the
question ‘do you usually cough up phlegm from your chest
first thing in the morning?’ and whose answer to the question ‘for how many months of the year does this usually
happen?’ was 3 months or more.
Self-rated overall health and physical impairments
(including eyesight problems; stomach or intestine problems; arthritis or rheumatism; heart problems; hearing difficulties or deafness etc.) were also assessed. Impairments
were rated as present if they interfered with activities ‘a little’ or ‘a lot’, as opposed to ‘not at all’.14 Women’s reproductive history (menarche, menopause and parity) was
also assessed. The informant rated the presence and severity of any behavioural and psychological symptoms
(Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire -NPI-Q).15
Finally, a physical examination was carried out comprising pulse and blood pressure, height, leg length, skull,
arm, waist and hip circumference and a structured neurological examination (NEUROEX).6 At follow-up only,
weight and calf circumference were also assessed.

Impacts of health
Socio-demographics
Information on age, sex, marital status, level of education
(none; some, but did not complete primary; completed
primary; completed secondary; completed tertiary or further education), household assets and household composition was assessed by a standard socio-demographic
questionnaire.

Health
For some conditions, health status was assessed using selfreported diagnoses, in response to the question ‘has a doctor ever told you that you suffered from’: stroke, diabetes,
hypertension, heart disease (and hyperlipidaemia, at follow-up only), TB, malaria or cysticercosis, and treatments
for these conditions. Directly assessed diagnoses included:
(i) Dementia, ascertained according to the cross-culturally

1. Disability. Disability was measured using the 12-item
World Health Organization Disability Assessment
Schedule version 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0). The WHODAS
2.0 has high internal consistency, moderate to
good test-retest reliability and good concurrent validity
in many different chronic disease clinical populations.16–18
2. Dependence. The interviewer administered open-ended
questions to the key informant, to ascertain needs for
care. The interviewer then coded whether the participant required no care, care some of the time or care
much of the time. This coding was based upon the
interviewer’s perception of needs for care, independently of whether these were routinely met.
Conditionally upon the presence of needs for care, we
further assessed: (i) Practical impact—contact time between caregiver and cared-for person19 and time spent
by the caregiver in the past 24 h in specific caregiving
activities;20 (ii) Caregiver perceived strain—the Zarit
Burden Interview (ZBI)21,22 with 22 items that assess
the caregiver’s appraisal of the impact their involvement has had on their lives.

3. Health service utilization was assessed using the Client
Service Receipt Inventory,23 a comprehensive assessment of direct and indirect economic costs for mental
health services, adapted for use in the developing
world.24 Help-seeking, specifically for symptoms and
signs of dementia, was assessed at follow-up only.

Risk exposures
Specific dementia risk factors (e.g. head injury with loss of
consciousness, family history of dementia) and broader lifestyle and cardiovascular risk factors including alcohol use
(volume and frequency currently and before the age of 60),
lifetime smoking (including pack-year calculation) and diet
and exercise levels now and in earlier life, were also assessed.

Biological samples
Fasting blood samples were collected in a subset of seven
Latin American sites (Cuba, Dominican Republic,
Venezuela, Puerto Rico, urban Peru, and urban and rural
Mexico), for which we are also able to report the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes and the extent of control
among diagnosed cases. We collected fluoride oxalate,
EDTA and clot samples. Haematological and biochemical
analyses were carried out in local laboratories. DNA was
extracted to create a resource for genotyping. The range of
assays carried out varied among sites, depending on feasibility and funding (see Table 2; and Supplementary
Table2, available as Supplementary data at IJE online).
Overall, 9178 blood samples were collected. By site, the
numbers and proportions providing samples were: Cuba
(2355, 80.4% of those participating in the survey),
Dominican Republic (1483, 73.8%), Puerto Rico (1584,
78.8%), Venezuela (1284, 65.3%), urban Peru (755,
54.7%), urban Mexico (822, 82.0%) and rural Mexico
(895, 89.5%). There were few differences in baseline characteristics of those who did and did not provide samples
(Supplementary Table 3, available as Supplementary data at
IJE online), and those differences were generally of small effect, other than in the urban Peru site where the more affluent and better educated, but also those with more physical
impairments, were more likely to give blood samples.
The new third-wave prevalence survey will include an
extended assessment of health status, including spirometry,
body mass index (BMI), visual acuity, grip strength and
hearing impairment. Moreover, a nested cohort of 300 individuals (150 with a high risk of incident dependence and
150 without) will be identified and extensive laboratory
testing of frailty biomarkers carried out. This sub-group
will be followed up 18 months later to re-assess vital

status, needs for care, disability, cognitive function and significant health life events in the intervening period.

What has it found? Key findings and
publications
Evidence on the construct and predictive validity of key
measures has been further strengthened. Norms for the cognitive tests indicate effects of age and education, and a modest effect of culture upon the cognitive tests (10-word
delayed recall and CSI-D COGSCORE) that form the core
of our 10/66 dementia diagnosis.25 Our confidence in the
validity of the 10/66 dementia diagnosis has been bolstered
by the demonstration, in Cuba, that it agreed better with
Cuban clinician diagnoses than did the DSM-IV computerzsed algorithm, which missed many recent-onset and
mild cases.10 Across the cohort, levels of disability were
similar for 10/66 dementia cases regardless of whether they
were confirmed as cases by the DSM-IV dementia algorithm.26 Crucially, in urban India where the disparity between the prevalence of 10/66 dementia and DSM-IV
dementia was greatest, those with 10/66 dementia had a
markedly elevated mortality rate, and survivors showed
clear evidence of clinical progression and increased needs
for care. Only one ‘case’ had unambiguously improved.
Cognitive function had deteriorated and disability increased
to a much greater extent than among those with CIND.
Hence, the strong predictive validity of the 10/66 dementia
diagnosis is consistent with a lack of sensitivity of the DSMIV criteria to mild-to-moderate cases, which may underestimate prevalence in less developed regions. Regarding the
WHODAS 2.0 disability assessment scale, in the 10/66
DRG population-based survey samples strong internal consistency and high factor loadings for the one-factor solution
supported unidimensionality, and the WHODAS 2.0 was
found to be a ‘strong’ Mokken scale in all sites.27
Morbidity in the baseline surveys of the cohort has been
described in detail, with publications on the prevalence of
dementia,26 mild cognitive impairment,28 mental disorder,29–32 sleep disorder,33 hypertension,34 stroke,35 anaemia,36 head injury37 and dependence38 (Table 3).
Prevalence of most chronic disorders, including dementia, is
similar to that in high-income countries for urban settings in
Latin America and China, and somewhat lower in rural settings and in India. Detailed country reports delineate the impact of population ageing and the epidemiological
transition on patterns of chronic disease morbidity and
needs for care in Cuba,39 Dominican Republic40 and
China.41 The independent impact of different chronic diseases and frailty42 on disability,43 dependence,38 co-resident

brain and mind (dementia, stroke and depression) to disability, dependence and costs, but an inverse association between dementia and healthcare service utilization.
The incidence of 10/66 dementia ranged from 18.2 to
30.4 per 1000 person-years, similar or higher than the incidence of dementia reported for high-income countries.
Incidence of 10/66 dementia was 1.4–2.7 times higher than
that for DSM-IV dementia (15.7 and 9.9 per 1000 personyears, respectively).46 Mortality hazards ratios for dementia
ranged from 1.56 to 5.69 by site.46 Education [hazard ratio
(HR): 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.81–0.97], and
male sex (0.72, 0.61–0.84) were inversely associated, and
older age [risk ratio (RR) per 5-year band 1.67, 1.56–1.79]
were all associated with incident dementia. Literacy, motor
sequencing and verbal fluency all protected against dementia onset, independent of education, providing support for
the cognitive reserve hypothesis.
Crude mortality rates varied from 27.3 to 70.0/1000
person-years, a 3-fold variation persisting after standardization for demographic and economic factors.47

What are the main strengths and
weaknesses?
One of the main strengths of this study was the use of a
one-phase design to estimate the prevalence, incidence, determinants and consequences of a comprehensive range of
chronic conditions, with a particularly robust dementia

assessment procedure specifically developed and validated
for use in LMIC. The same standardized protocol, which
included validated measurements and diagnostic algorithms, was used in each site, permitting comparison of estimates across diverse settings and aiding the interpretation
of observed variations. The relatively large sample size also
allows quite precise estimations of effect sizes, in particular
with meta-analysed pooled estimates. Response rates were
also high, and the number of missing values relatively low.
Although the use of catchment areas increased the response
rates, this could have affected the generalizability of the
findings beyond the specific study sites.

Can I get hold of the data? Where can I find
out more?
The 10/66 cohort is an open-access database, and we
would encourage external investigators to consider applying to use the data for secondary analyses, in order to
maximize the scientific output from the data. All the information on how to access the 10/66 public data archive,
with a list of current proposals and papers currently under
preparation, can be found on our website: [www.alz.co.
