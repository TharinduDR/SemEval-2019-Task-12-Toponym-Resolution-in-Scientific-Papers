An association of gestational weight gain (GWG) with offspring cognition has been postulated. We used data
from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a United Kingdom prospective cohort (1990 through
the present) with a median of 10 maternal weight measurements in pregnancy. These were used to allocate
participants to 2009 Institute of Medicine weight-gain categories and in random effect linear spline models. Outcomes were School Entry Assessment score (age, 4 years; n = 5,832), standardized intelligence quotient
assessed by Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (age, 8 years; n = 5,191), and school final-examination
results (age, 16 years; n = 7,339). Offspring of women who gained less weight than recommended had a 0.075
standard deviation lower mean School Entry Assessment score (95% confidence interval: −0.127, −0.023) and
were less likely to achieve adequate final-examination results (odds ratio = 0.88, 95% confidence interval: 0.78,
0.99) compared with offspring of women who gained as recommended. GWG in early pregnancy (defined as
0–18 weeks on the basis of a knot point at 18 weeks) and midpregnancy (defined as 18–28 weeks on the basis
of knot points at 18 and 28 weeks) was positively associated with School Entry Assessment score and intelligence quotient. GWG in late pregnancy (defined as 28 weeks onward on the basis of a knot point at 28 weeks)
was positively associated with offspring intelligence quotient and with increased odds of offspring achieving adequate final-examination results in mothers who were overweight prepregnancy. Findings support small positive
associations between GWG and offspring cognitive development, which may have lasting effects on educational
attainment up to age 16 years.

In humans, brain development occurs primarily in utero
and during early infancy, and nutrition during these periods
may be important for normal development and later cognition. For example, greater dysregulation of second- and
third-trimester maternal lipid metabolism (indicated by
higher levels of serum free fatty acids and β-hydroxybutyrate
in the blood) is inversely correlated with childhood intelligence quotient (IQ) at age 4 years in offspring of diabetic
mothers (1, 2). In diabetic mothers, acetonuria (a signiﬁer of
fasting or starvation) during pregnancy is inversely associated
with offspring intelligence at age 5 years (3). In contrast,

evidence from the Dutch Famine suggests that extreme malnutrition during pregnancy does not affect cognition in offspring at age 19 years (4), though cognitive decline in older
age in the same population began earlier in those exposed to
famine in utero than in those who were not exposed (5).
These scenarios are extreme and it is unclear whether
less drastic undernutrition that affects gestational weight
gain (GWG) but does not necessarily cause weight loss is
related to offspring cognition (6). To the best of our knowledge, only 1 previous study has assessed the relationship
between GWG and offspring cognition. That study found
402

Gestational Weight Gain and Offspring Cognition 403

that offspring of women who gained between 2 and 13 kg
during pregnancy scored higher on the Raven Colored Progressive Matrices test at age 5 years than did those whose
mothers gained less than 2 kg or more than 13 kg, even
when adjusting for the mothers’ prepregnancy weight/height
ratio (7).
Our aim was to use repeated measures of gestational
weight to examine the association of GWG with offspring’s
School Entry Assessment (SEA) scores at age 4 years, IQ
at age 8 years, and school ﬁnal-examination results at age
16 years. We hypothesized that GWG would be positively
associated with outcomes assessed in early life, and that
this association may have a long-term impact on school
attainment at age 16 years (the legal minimum school
leaving age in the United Kingdom when critical examinations are taken to determine whether a student can continue
on to higher education) and on future occupation outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants

The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children
(ALSPAC) is a prospective, population-based birth cohort
study that recruited 14,541 pregnant women resident in
Avon, United Kingdom, with expected delivery dates
between April 1, 1991, and December 31, 1992 (http://
www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/). The study included 13,617
mother-offspring pairs from singleton livebirths who survived to at least 1 year; only these are considered here. We
further restricted analyses to women with complete GWG
data (n = 12,484) and with term deliveries (between 37 and
44 weeks of gestation, n = 12,449). Figure 1 shows the
study participant ﬂow. Ethical approval for the study was
obtained from the ALSPAC Ethics and Law Committee
and the local research ethics committee.
Gestational weight gain

Maternal GWG was examined in 2 ways. A categorical
measure of “less than recommended,” “as recommended,”
and “more than recommended” was created, reﬂecting the
2009 Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommendations (6).
The recommended weight gain varies on the basis of prepregnancy body mass index (BMI), which is measured and
deﬁned as weight (kg)/height (m)2. The recommended
absolute gain (weight in late pregnancy before delivery
minus weight prepregnancy or at the start of pregnancy) is
12.5–18 kg for women with a BMI of <18.5; 11.5–16 kg
for women with a BMI of 18.5–24.9; 7–11.5 kg for women
with a BMI of 25–29.9 and 5–9 kg for women with a BMI
of ≥30 (6).We classiﬁed women according to these prepregnancy BMI categories to determine whether each subject’s GWG was less than, as, or more than recommended.
Prepregnancy BMI was based on self-reports of prepregnancy height and weight obtained when women enrolled in
the study. Additionally, all pregnancy weight measurements
(median, 10 measurements; interquartile range, 8–11 measurements) were used to develop a linear spline multilevel
model (with 2 levels, woman and measurement occasion)
Am J Epidemiol. 2013;177(5):402–410

relating weight to gestational age, with knots at 18 and
28 weeks. This multilevel model was then used to predict
each woman’s weight at 0 weeks’ gestation (referred to as
“prepregnancy weight”) and GWG ( per week) from 0 to
18 weeks (early pregnancy, based on a knot point at
18 weeks); from 18 to 28 weeks (midpregnancy, based on
knot points at 18 and 28 weeks); and from 28 weeks to
delivery (late pregnancy, based on a knot point at 28
weeks). Further details of the multilevel model used to
derive these variables are described by Fraser et al. (8) and
can be found in the Web Appendix, Web Table 1, and Web
Figures 1 and 2 available at http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/.
In particular, there is no evidence that the model predicted
any better or worse depending on the subject’s weight, and
thus measurement error in our measures of prepregnancy
weight and GWG is likely to be nondifferential across
these exposures. Maternal prepregnancy weight and GWG
were scaled to be meaningful by examining the variation in
offspring outcomes per additional 1 kg of maternal prepregnancy weight and per 400 g of gain per week of gestation
(6). Prepregnancy weight predicted from the spline multilevel model was highly correlated with self-reported prepregnancy weight (Pearson’s r = 0.94).

Outcomes

SEA scores (based on examinations taken at 4 years of
age) were extracted from Local Educational Authority
recording. The scores from 0 (low) to 20 (high) are derived
from the summation of 4 required skills (language, reading,
writing, and mathematics) and assessed by teachers for
every child enrolled in the compulsory education system in
the United Kingdom.
At 8 years of age, children’s cognitive function was measured in the ALSPAC research clinics using the Wechsler
Intelligence Scale for Children (9). IQs (mean, 100 (standard deviation, 15) points) are derived from these data. The
tests comprise 10 subtests (5 verbal and 5 performance
subtests) that sum to the verbal IQ and performance IQ. All
tests were administered by clinicians who had earned a
bachelor’s degree in psychology.
General Certiﬁcate of Secondary Education (GCSE)
results were extracted from the National Pupil Database.
GCSEs are examinations taken by secondary school children aged 16 years (the minimum age at which children are
legally allowed to ﬁnish formal education in the United
Kingdom; they are thus the ﬁnal school examinations taken
by all children in the United Kingdom). Results were coded
as 3 separate binary measures. The category indicating
“high achievement” represents a grade of A* (highest possible grade) or A on 9 or more GCSEs. The category indicating “adequate ﬁnal-examination results” represents a
grade ranging between A* and C (lowest passing grade) on
5 or more GCSEs, including those in English and mathematics. (This measurement is relevant because it is the
requirement to continue to higher education and also a
requirement for many semiskilled jobs.) The category indicating “low achievement” represents no passing grades on
any GCSEs.

Other variables

Information on maternal age, mode of delivery (cesarean
or vaginal delivery), and the child’s sex was obtained from
obstetrical records. On the basis of questionnaire responses,
maternal education level was assessed and divided into 5
categories: 1) Certiﬁed Secondary Education, a lower level
of attainment than ordinary (O-level) examinations taken at
age 16 years; 2) vocational training; 3) ordinary (O-level)
examinations; 4) advanced (A-level) examinations; and
5) university degree.
Information on the highest occupation of parental
ﬁgures in the household was recorded from questionnaire
responses collected in late pregnancy (≥32 weeks’ gestation) and was used to allocate the children to family social
class groups using categories deﬁned in the 1991 British
Standard Occupational Classiﬁcation system as follows: I,
professional occupations; II, managerial and technical
occupations; IIIN, skilled nonmanual occupations; IIIM,
skilled manual occupations; IV, partly skilled occupations;
V, unskilled occupations (10).
Information on parity and on maternal smoking in pregnancy was also obtained from questionnaire responses.
Information on maternal smoking was grouped as follows:
1) never smoked; 2) smoked before pregnancy or in the
ﬁrst trimester and then stopped; 3) smoked throughout
pregnancy.
Statistical analysis

Both the SEA scores and IQs were standardized (each
value was divided by its standard deviation) to allow direct
comparison. Multivariable logistic and linear regression
models were used to assess the associations of GWG (using

IOM categories and estimates from the multilevel model
described above and in the Web Appendix) with offspring
outcomes. Because of the nonrarity of the outcome we
have not assumed that the resulting odds ratios are indicative of risk ratios but describe them throughout as odds
ratios. Furthermore, we repeated these analyses by using
Poisson regression. Analyses were conducted in STATA,
version 11.0, software (StataCorp LP, College Station,
Texas).
The IOM analysis included the following models. Model
1 was adjusted for gestational age, maternal age, age at
outcome assessment, and sex. Model 2 was adjusted for the
confounders listed for model 1 as well as prepregnancy
BMI, maternal smoking during pregnancy, parity, mode of
delivery, and maternal education. We consider model 2 to
be the main model. We also explored potential mediation
by birth weight to explore whether fetal growth is driving
any association and by SEA scores (for IQ and ﬁnalexamination results), both of which are reported in Web
Tables 2 and 3.
Models in which GWG was expressed using estimates
from the multilevel model were the same, except that we
also adjusted for prepregnancy weight and weight gain
occurring earlier in pregnancy. Moreover, in these models
we did not adjust for gestational age as this is accounted
for in the estimates from the multilevel models. We tested
for possible interactions between being overweight/obese
before pregnancy (indicated by a BMI of ≥25) and GWG
in their association with outcomes.

are presented in Web Table 4. Although some statistical
evidence of differences was found, the magnitude of these
differences was generally small. Table 1 shows the characteristics of mothers and offspring according to whether the
mothers gained less than, more than, or as recommended
weight in pregnancy. Women who gained less than recommended were slightly older and were more likely to smoke
in pregnancy, to be from a manual social class, and to be
multiparous than women who gained as recommended.
Women who gained less than recommended also had
babies with a lower mean birth weight. Women who gained
more than recommended were slightly younger, were less
likely to smoke in pregnancy, and were less educated compared with women who gained as recommended. They
were also more likely to be nulliparous, to have had a
cesarean delivery, and to have had heavier offspring.
Table 2 shows SEA scores at age 4 years and IQs at age 8
years by ﬁnal-examination results at age 16 years. Children
who achieved adequate ﬁnal-examination results had higher
mean SEA scores compared with children who did not.
Table 3 shows the multivariable associations of IOM categories of GWG with offspring cognitive outcomes. Offspring of women who gained less than recommended had
lower mean SEA scores, even when adjusting for potential
confounders (model 2). These children were also less likely
to achieve adequate ﬁnal-examination results at age 16
years in the basic and confounder-adjusted models (models
1 and 2). No association was found between less than recommended GWG and offspring IQ. Adjustment for birth
weight did not attenuate the association with SEA scores
but did slightly attenuate the relationship between GWG
and ﬁnal-examination results. Adjustment for SEA scores
did not result in further attenuation (see Web Table 2).
There was no strong evidence for associations of more
than recommended GWG with SEA scores or IQs. More
than recommended GWG was associated with decreased
odds of obtaining adequate ﬁnal-examination results in the
unadjusted model (model 1), but this attenuated to the null
when adjusting for confounders. Results of the equivalent
analyses for “high achievement” (9 or more GCSE grades
of A* or A) and “low achievement” (0 passing GCSE
grades) are presented in Web Table 5. There was no strong
evidence of associations between IOM categories of GWG
and high achievement, but both less than recommended
GWG and more than recommended GWG were associated
with greater odds of low GCSE achievement.
Table 4 shows the associations of prepregnancy weight
and GWG with offspring cognitive outcomes by using
the estimates from the multilevel model. There was no
evidence of an interaction between prepregnancy overweight/obesity and GWG in relation to SEA scores and IQs
(all P values for interaction > 0.14). There was evidence of
an interaction between prepregnancy overweight/obesity
and GWG in relation to ﬁnal-examination results at age 16
years (all P values for interaction < 0.004), and we have
presented results stratiﬁed by prepregnancy overweight/
obesity for this outcome.
Prepregnancy weight was inversely associated with SEA
scores, IQs, and the odds of achieving adequate ﬁnalexamination results at age 16 years in model 1. These
Am J Epidemiol. 2013;177(5):402–410

associations remained largely unchanged with adjustment
for potential confounders (model 2). Because thinner
women gain more during pregnancy (6), we also repeated
the analysis for prepregnancy weight while adjusting for all
GWG variables. Results (available upon request) were
unchanged from those presented. Adjustment for birth
weight did not importantly change the associations, but
adjustment for SEA scores attenuated the association of
prepregnancy weight with IQs and ﬁnal-examination results
(see Web Table 3 for all mediation analyses).
GWG in all 3 periods of pregnancy was positively associated with IQs in both confounder-adjusted models
(models 1 and 2). GWG in all 3 periods was positively
associated with SEA scores in model 1. The associations of
early pregnancy and midpregnancy GWG with SEA scores
persisted in the fully adjusted model (model 2) and were of
similar magnitude to associations with IQs. The association
of later pregnancy GWG with SEA scores was attenuated
toward the null in the fully adjusted confounder model
(model 2). Adjustment for birth weight slightly attenuated
models for SEA scores and IQs (Web Table 3).
In all models, GWG in early pregnancy was negatively
associated with obtaining adequate ﬁnal-examination
results at age 16 years for offspring of women who were
not overweight/obese prepregnancy, though conﬁdence
intervals included the null value. In contrast, in overweight
women, GWG in early pregnancy was positively associated
with the odds of achieving adequate ﬁnal-examination results
in all models. In midpregnancy, there was no evidence of
an association between GWG and ﬁnal-examination results
in offspring of women with a normal BMI (18.5–24.9), but
in overweight/obese women there was a strong positive association in model 1, which attenuated when adjusted for
confounders (model 2). In late pregnancy, in women who
were not overweight/obese, there was a positive association
in model 1, which attenuated to the null when confounders
(model 2) were included in the models. A strong positive
association between GWG and ﬁnal-examination results
was found in overweight/obese women and remained when
adjusting for confounders (model 2). Mediator adjustment
did not attenuate the relationship in early or late pregnancy.
In midpregnancy, birth weight further attenuated the relationship, but SEA scores did not.
When analyses were restricted to mother-offspring pairs
who had all outcomes measured (n = 3,340), similar results
to those presented here were obtained, although conﬁdence
intervals increased in width as expected (see Web Tables 6
and 7). When analyses were restricted to women without
diabetes in pregnancy (existing or gestational diabetes,
n = 36 excluded), point estimates for SEA scores and ﬁnalexamination results were comparable to those presented.
However, for IQs, point estimates became more pronounced. For example, in IOM model 3 (adjusting for confounders plus birth weight), the point estimate increased
from 0.066 to 0.205 for those who gained more than recommended. Replacing maternal education with household
social class in the analyses did not change results. Finally,
when analyses for ﬁnal-examination results were repeated
by using Poisson regression (Web Tables 8 and 9), results
were in the same direction as those presented here but point

estimates were closer to the null value. This is as expected
because odds ratios will overestimate risk when an outcome
is not rare.
DISCUSSION

In this contemporary birth cohort, we found that women
who gained less weight during pregnancy than recommended
by the 2009 IOM guidelines had offspring who achieved
lower SEA scores at age 4 years and who were less likely
to achieve adequate ﬁnal-examination results at age 16
years, even when adjusting for potential confounders
including maternal education. Offspring of women who
gained more than recommended also had poorer ﬁnalexamination results at age 16 years. Examining the associations in more detail revealed that higher prepregnancy
weight was associated with poorer outcomes for SEA scores
at age 4 years, IQ at age 8 years, and ﬁnal-examination
results at age 16 years, and that greater GWG throughout

pregnancy was generally associated with better cognitive
outcomes in offspring. Birth weight seemed to partially
mediate associations between GWG and outcomes, as did
the association of GWG with SEA scores in relation to
later outcomes (IQs and ﬁnal-examination results). Associations in most cases were weakened but not completely
attenuated. The magnitudes of the associations that we have
observed are generally modest in size and are unlikely to
have major importance for individuals. However, at a population level modest shifts in the distribution of educational
attainment could be important. Any potential beneﬁt to IQ
and educational attainment that might be achieved from
increasing GWG would need to be considered alongside
possible adverse effects on offspring adiposity and cardiovascular risk.
Results of our analysis using IOM categories of GWG
are broadly consistent with those from a previous study
(n = 2,590) that found cognitive scores to be higher in offspring of mothers who gained between 2 and 13 kg during

Gestational Weight Gain and Offspring Cognition 409

gestation than in those whose mothers gained less than
2 kg or more than 13 kg (7). Our study is considerably larger,
and we were able to examine associations in greater detail
with repeated measurements of weight during pregnancy.
GWG is a complex measure that includes maternal fat
deposition, volume expansion, placenta, amniotic ﬂuid, and
fetus. In terms of plausible mechanisms by which GWG
might inﬂuence the cognitive and educational outcomes of
offspring, several of these components might be involved.
Greater maternal fat deposition might result in greater delivery of glucose and fatty acids to the developing fetus,
which in turn might inﬂuence fetal brain development.
Fetal size may reﬂect particular environmental exposures
affecting growth in general and brain development in particular. We were able to examine some of these in our more
detailed analysis. We did not ﬁnd clear evidence that GWG
in the ﬁrst 18 weeks of pregnancy, when the contribution
of maternal fat deposition to overall GWG is greatest, is
speciﬁcally associated with cognitive outcomes, suggesting
that maternal fat deposition may not be the main driver of
associations. In our study, birth weight partially mediated
associations of GWG with offspring cognitive outcomes,
suggesting that fetal growth is not the main driver of associations. However, adjusting for birth weight is not simple,
because unless all confounders of the relationship are included,
conditioning on a mediator can result in collider bias (11, 12).
The analysis adjusting for birth weight (Web Tables 2 and 3)
should be interpreted bearing this in mind (13).
Our ﬁndings may reﬂect the association of fetal growth
with childhood cognition. Alternatively, the observed association of birth weight with IQ and, here of GWG with cognitive outcomes could be attributable to residual confounding
and not reﬂections of a direct intrauterine effect (14). In particular, it may be that problems during pregnancy such as
preeclampsia could result in changes in GWG, rendering it
not a completely modiﬁable risk factor, as placental problems during pregnancy would cause changes in both GWG
and offspring cognition. However, even if this is the case
and the association is a product of such residual confounding
and not causal, monitoring of GWG may still be important.
Our ﬁnding that prepregnancy weight is inversely associated with offspring cognition is hard to explain given the
postulated mechanism suggesting that adequate supply of
nourishment is necessary for healthy fetal brain development. According to this mechanism we would expect both
prepregnancy weight and GWG, particularly in early pregnancy, to be positively associated with offspring cognition
across their distribution in a general, healthy population.
One possibility is that smoking and/or socioeconomic position confounds the association of prepregnancy weight with
offspring cognition; however, we adjusted for both of these
factors in our analysis. Another possibility is that weight
acquisition in pregnancy is somehow different from prepregnancy weight in relation to offspring IQ (though not to
other outcomes) (8, 15). Finally, because thinner women
gain more in pregnancy (6) our estimate for prepregnancy
weight could be biased. To test this possibility, we repeated
the analysis for prepregnancy weight while adjusting for
GWG in all periods. Results were unchanged from those
presented (results available on request).

Study strengths and limitations

To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst general population
study with repeat measurements of weight in pregnancy to
examine the association of GWG with offspring cognition,
an area of research that was highlighted as important in the
IOM report (6). We were able to examine cognitive outcomes across childhood from age 4–16 years, including
educational attainment, which has an important impact on
future health and wellbeing. Our sample size is relatively
large and we were able to adjust for a wide range of potential
confounding factors, including maternal education, though
because our study is observational, residual confounding
cannot be ruled out. Replicating these ﬁndings in additional
studies with similar detailed measurements of gestational
weight would be valuable. Sibling studies, which inherently
control for shared genetic and environmental factors and
have been used previously to examine GWG in relation to
offspring BMI in later life (16), may be useful to explore
GWG’s association with offspring cognition.
Not all mother-offspring pairs were included in analyses
because of missing data, mostly outcome data. However, this
should bias the results only if missingness depends on the
outcome, conditional on all the variables in the model. The
general similarity of ﬁndings across the 3 outcomes (which
were available on slightly different groups) suggests that our
associations are not markedly biased by missing data.
Conclusion

Prepregnancy weight is inversely associated with childhood
IQ and school achievement; however, GWG is positively
associated with outcomes, even when controlling for available
potential confounders. Although previous ﬁndings based on
the same cohort suggest that less than recommended GWG
(by 2009 IOM guidelines) is associated with a healthier cardiovascular proﬁle in both mothers (15) and offspring (8),
this study emphasizes the need to recognize that deﬁning
optimal GWG is complex with competing risks at play.
