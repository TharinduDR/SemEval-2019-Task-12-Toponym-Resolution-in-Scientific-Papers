Abstract
The ability of influenza A viruses (IAVs) to cross species barriers and evade host immunity is a major public health concern.
Studies on the phylodynamics of IAVs across different scales – from the individual to the population – are essential for
devising effective measures to predict, prevent or contain influenza emergence. Understanding how IAVs spread and evolve
during outbreaks is critical for the management of epidemics. Reconstructing the transmission network during a single
outbreak by sampling viral genetic data in time and space can generate insights about these processes. Here, we obtained
intra-host viral sequence data from horses infected with equine influenza virus (EIV) to reconstruct the spread of EIV during
a large outbreak. To this end, we analyzed within-host viral populations from sequences covering 90% of the infected yards.
By combining gene sequence analyses with epidemiological data, we inferred a plausible transmission network, in turn
enabling the comparison of transmission patterns during the course of the outbreak and revealing important
epidemiological features that were not apparent using either approach alone. The EIV populations displayed high levels
of genetic diversity, and in many cases we observed distinct viral populations containing a dominant variant and a number
of related minor variants that were transmitted between infectious horses. In addition, we found evidence of frequent
mixed infections and loose transmission bottlenecks in these naturally occurring populations. These frequent mixed
infections likely influence the size of epidemics.

Introduction
Studying the evolution of influenza A viruses (IAVs) across
different scales – from the individual to the global population – is
critical for understanding the risk of cross-species transmissions
and the potential for emergence of novel pandemic viruses. Time-
informed phylogenetic approaches have been instrumental in
understanding the evolutionary origin of recent pandemic strains
[1], and experimental studies of naturally transmitted IAVs have
revealed the patterns of genetic variation at the level of single hosts
as well as the inter-host transmission of viral variants [2,3]. To
date, however, few studies have achieved sufficiently dense
sampling during a naturally occurring outbreak to integrate
epidemiological processes with evolution at the scale of individual
hosts [4].
Equine influenza virus (EIV) is the aetiological agent of equine
influenza (EI), an important disease of the horse. Two EIV
subtypes have been detected: H7N7, now believed to be extinct
[5,6], and the currently circulating H3N8 subtype, which is
distributed across most of the world as a result of the international
movement of horses [7–10]. Currently, two clades of EIV circulate
worldwide, and are denoted Florida Clades 1 and 2 [11,12]. In the
early 2000’s, EIV jumped the species barrier and emerged as a
novel respiratory virus in dogs, canine influenza virus (CIV) [13].
Newmarket, United Kingdom, is a town with a high density of
thoroughbred horses. These animals are kept in individual stables,
in yards that hold between ,20 and 250 horses each. Yards are
geographically very close to each other (Figure S1). In some cases,
horses are in modern barn systems with a shared airspace for
,,30 animals, while in others they are in more traditional single
PLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 1 December 2012 | Volume 8 | Issue 12 | e1003081
stable system with no shared airspace. Each horse goes out to train
once daily for approximately one hour (usually not on Sundays) in
‘strings’ that just consist of animals from their yard. Hence, other
than passing on the paths or roads to and from the training areas,
there is little mixing of horses among yards (see Fig. 2 in [14] for
more detail). Despite high vaccination coverage (vaccination of
racehorses is mandatory in the UK) Newmarket has periodically
experienced EI outbreaks. In the spring of 2003 a large EI
outbreak affected recently vaccinated horses in yards throughout
the town. This outbreak was part of a larger epidemic that affected
horses elsewhere in the UK and also in Europe [14–16]. Unlike
previous localized EI outbreaks, the 2003 outbreak saw infections
in a high number of yards in Newmarket.
Like other RNA viruses, intra-host populations of EIV are
typically large and experience high rates of mutation [12,17].
Transmission studies have shown that intra-host IAV populations
display relatively high levels of genetic variation and relatively
loose transmission bottlenecks, such that multiple viral variants are
passed between animals at transmission [2,3,18]. Because multiple
variants are transmitted between hosts, these minor variants could
be potentially used to reconstruct the network of inter-host
transmission during an outbreak. In turn, such a network could
provide important insights into the mechanisms that shape viral
diversity during localized epidemics and their impact at the global
scale. Accurate identification of inter-horse transmission pathways
will depend on the extent and structure of intra-yard and intra-
host viral genetic variation, as well as the size of the transmission
bottlenecks [19]. Although phylogenetic methods have been very
informative for revealing key aspects of the evolution and spread of
viruses [20,21], they have limitations for inferring transmission
trees from densely sampled outbreaks where population consensus
sequences exhibit extreme similarity and where samples include
both ancestral and descendent isolates. Indeed, recently developed
graph approaches provide an alternative method to reconstruct
transmission trees from molecular data and accompanying
sampling dates and locations [22].
Here, we examined intra-host EIV genetic variation from horses
affected during the 2003 EI outbreak that took place in
Newmarket. We used both phylogenetic and graph approaches
to infer the pathways of virus transmission. We also determined
the transmission potential of EIV during the course of the
outbreak by combining gene sequence and epidemiological data.
Results
Spatio-temporal patterns of influenza infection during
the outbreak
Nasal swabs from horses were obtained from 19 of the 21 (90%)
yards in Newmarket infected during the outbreak (March 13th
to
May 8th
2003) as well as three yards located outside of Newmarket
(yards O, T and W). Details about the number of horses in training
per yard, as well as the yard location and date of first diagnosis can
be found in [16]. We estimated the size of within-host viral
populations by qPCR. Virus circulation was particularly high in
Newmarket between the 7th
and the 29th
of April when 11 yards
were concurrently infected (Figure 1). We combined these data
with previously available data from a rapid diagnostic ELISA-
based test [14] to determine the order in which the yards became
infected based on the recorded date of each sample. Our results
show that the order of infection was A.B.C.D+E+F+-
G.H+I.J+K followed by all the remaining yards (Figure 1 and
Figure S1).
Horses were sampled, as described in [16], typically when
affected with clinical respiratory disease during the outbreak. We
obtained within-host viral sequences from samples that exhibited
viral populations of sufficient size (measured by qPCR). In total,
we sequenced viral populations from 50 horses, representing yards
A to W. This subset of samples spanned the outbreak peak as they
were obtained between March 13th
and May 8th
. Viral popula-
tions from three horses (L25, L27, L42) were sampled at two
separate time points. We geo-located 48 horses with viral
sequences to their training yards (45 in Newmarket) (Figure S1).
Naturally infected horses exhibit high levels of within-
host viral diversity
We sequenced 2361 clones of the hemagglutinin 1 gene (HA1)
derived from intra-host samples (a total of 2,131,983 nucleotides,
GenBank accession numbers HE967958 to HE970318, Dataset
S1) that spanned the first 903 nucleotides (nt) of HA1. This region
of HA1 includes all the putative antigenic sites and the receptor-
binding domain. To define mutations in our data set we used as a
reference a consensus sequence from an isolate obtained during
the outbreak (A/equine/Newmarket/5/2003, GenBank accession
number FJ375213.1). We detected 493 different mutations, of
which 321 were found in individual horses and not shared with
others. The estimated mutation frequency ranged from 2.3E24
to
7.5E24
mutations per nucleotide site (when only unique mutations
were considered or all mutations were assumed to have originated
de novo, respectively). For these data, the mean pairwise distance
per sample ranged from 0.0002 to 0.0025 and the mean dN/dS per
sample varied between 0.14 and 19.89. The estimated dN/dS for
the data set as a whole was 0.89 (95% CI = 0.80, 0.97), indicative
of weak purifying selection over the eight-week period, and no sites
were documented to be under significant positive selection.
Author Summary
Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are major pathogens of humans
and animals. Understanding how IAVs spread and evolve
at different scales (individual, regional, global) in natural
conditions is critical for preventing or managing influenza
epidemics. A vast body of knowledge has been generated
on the evolution of IAVs at the global scale. Additionally,
recent experimental transmission studies have examined
the diversity and transmission of influenza viruses within
and between hosts. However, most studies on the spread
of IAVs during epidemics have been based on consensus
viral sequences, an approach that does not have enough
discriminatory power to reveal exact transmission path-
ways. Here, we analyzed multiple within-host viral popu-
lations from different horses infected with equine influen-
za virus (EIV) during the course of an outbreak in a
population within a confined area. This provided an
opportunity to examine the genetic diversity of the viruses
within single animals, the transmission of the viruses
between each closely confined population within a yard,
and the transmission between horses in different yards.
We show that individual horses can be infected by viruses
from more than one other horse, which has important
implications for facilitating segment reassortment and the
evolution of EIV. Additionally, by combining viral sequenc-
ing data and epidemiological data we show that the high
levels of mixed infections can reveal the underlying
epidemiological dynamics of the outbreak, and that
epidemic size could be underestimated if only epidemio-
logical data is considered. As sequencing technologies
become cheaper and faster, these analyses could be
undertaken almost in real-time and help control future
outbreaks.

Overall, we observed mutations at 455 nucleotide sites in HA1,
of which 161 were synonymous and 332 non-synonymous.
Interestingly, 659 sequences carried a specific non-synonymous
mutation at site 230, and 31 sequences also carried the
synonymous mutations C69T and A384T. Site 230 is polymorphic
at the epidemiological-scale (91% G, 9% A), as is site 69 (97.9% C,
1.4% T, 0.7% A), while all other epidemiological-scale EIV
sequences display A at site 384.
Distinct consensus sequences circulated during the
outbreak
We examined the consensus sequence for each horse to
determine whether particular mutations had been fixed during
the course of the outbreak. Within Newmarket, we observed only
two different consensus sequences in the 19 yards sampled
(excluding horse B03 with only six sequences, Table 1). A third
consensus sequence was observed outside of Newmarket in the
only horse sampled in yard T. Notably, variants carrying mutation
G230A (Arg62Lys of the mature HA) were found in 14 horses that
were stabled in 6 different yards, including all sampled horses from
yard L. While 38 horses exhibited G230 at the consensus level,
twelve horses exhibited A230. One horse (L27) that was sampled
twice displayed G230 in the consensus on the first sampling date
(April 10th
) and A230 subsequently (April 14th
). Despite detecting
four different EIV consensus sequences, only a single mutation
(A230) was fixed during the short time frame of the outbreak in
Newmarket.
Dynamics of EIV genetic diversity at the individual and
population level
At the individual level, all horses (except for L27 and L40 as
discussed below), displayed viral populations characterized by the
presence of a dominant variant and a number of minor variants.
For example, Figure 2 illustrates the intra-host diversity among
four horses with respect to sequences with G230 and A230: the
first horse to have A230 as a dominant variant was F11 on March
28th
, with all clones sequenced from this horse carrying the
mutation. On the same day, horse E09 exhibited A230 linked to
C690, suggesting that A230 could have been present in the viral
population before March 28th
. Of the three horses sampled twice
during the course of the outbreak, horse L25 and L42 exhibited
sequences with A230 as the dominant variant on both sampled
days, whilst L27 initially displayed sequences with G230 and then
A230 four days later (Figure 2) illustrating the individual
heterogeneity in viral dynamics. This change in the dominant
variant could be due to the latter variant superseding sequences
with G230 or as a result of a mixed infection.
At the population level, we observed the asymptotic appearance
of new mutations (Figure S2A) and an increase in mean pairwise
distance (Figure S2D) mirroring the increase in the number of
infected individuals (Figure S2B), suggesting that the viral diversity
sequenced is not limited by the number of horses sampled (Figure
S2C). The frequency of sequences with G230 fluctuated over the
course of the outbreak, with an increase in sequences with A230
between April 15th
and April 22nd
(Figure S2E) and no sequences
with A230 after April 22nd
suggesting the extinction of the
sequences with A230.
Evolution of EIV across scales
To determine how the genetic diversity of EIV during the
outbreak relates to that observed at the global scale, we aligned all
the unique intra-host sequences together with 284 publicly
available epidemiological sequences (Dataset S2). The phylogeny
of the unique sequences from our data set noting the yards in
which the sequence was found is shown in Figure S3. As expected,
with the exception of nine sequences from a single horse (see below
and [2]), all sequences clustered together, showing that despite the
high levels of genetic diversity observed at the individual level, they
represent a minor component of the global genetic diversity of
EIV. More surprising was the lack of phylogenetic differentiation
between yards. The most commonly found sequence was G230
with 1235 copies in 38 different horses from 19 yards (Figure S3).
Strains related to G230 continue to circulate in Europe and
worldwide today. The second most frequently found sequence was
A230, found in 490 copies from 14 horses in six different yards.
This complete sequence is not found at the global scale and is
likely to be a variant unique to this outbreak. As noted previously
[2], one horse (L40) contained nine copies of a sequence similar to
a strain from Florida Clade 1 circulating in North America and
South Africa in 2003 (Figure S3 inset), suggesting a mixed
infection of the Florida Clades 1 and 2. However, as we found no
other horses carrying Florida Clade 1 sequences, these nine
sequences were excluded from subsequent analyses.
Minority variants are transmitted between horses and
yards
To determine whether EIV transmission bottlenecks are
sufficiently loose to allow the passage of multiple variants between
horses during the outbreak, we examined the number of shared
mutations between horses. Of the 493 mutations detected, 117
non-synonymous (24%) and 55 synonymous (11%) mutations were
shared among different horses (Table S1). Of 117 non-synony-
mous mutations, 19 were located at antigenic sites and 6 at
glycosylation sites, indicating that variants with distinct antigenic-
ity could arise within single horses and be transmitted. Interest-
ingly, two mutations causing stop codons were shared between
horses: G585A was shared between L25 and M32, and G711A
was shared between A01 and M29. G585A, which was linked to
A230 in horse L25 and G230 in horse M32, likely arose
independently as both horses were sampled on the same day. It
was not possible to determine whether G711A was generated de
novo in A01 and M29 or whether it was transmitted. Horses A01
and M29 were stabled in different yards and the period of time
between sampling was 26 days.
In most cases only two horses shared a particular mutation, but
we observed up to eight mutations shared between two horses (e.g.
between L25 and L42). To determine whether mutations shared
between horses followed a non-random pattern consistent with
transmission pathways, we compared the distribution of observed
shared mutations between pairs of horses to the null (random)
expectation. The latter distribution was obtained by randomly
assigning the observed mutations to individual horses. Results
show that the pattern of shared mutations between pairs of horses
was indeed non-random (Chi-squared test, p,0.001), indicative of
inter-horse viral transmission.

Transmission Dynamics of EIV during an Outbreak
PLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 5 December 2012 | Volume 8 | Issue 12 | e1003081
Only seven of the 172 shared mutations were unique to a single
yard and there were no significant differences in the number of
shared mutations within yards compared to between yards when
horses housed only in Newmarket were considered (W = 5614, p-
value = 0.79). However, there was a significant association
between the number of shared mutations and the distance
between yards (slope = 21.14, p,0.05) and the number of days
separating the dates of infection in the yards (slope = 20.03,
p,0.001). Overall, these results suggest that a large number of
mutations were shared between yards and the distance between
yards and the time period between infection of horses correlates
with the number of shared mutations.
Mixed infections are common at the individual and yard
level
To test whether mixed infections are common in the field
during an outbreak we used a graph based algorithm designed to
reconstruct disease outbreaks using genetic data, sampling date
and location [22] as phylogenetic approaches with few fixed
mutations provide multifurcating trees with little resolution. Prior
to this analysis, we removed 242 sequences that exhibited 81
mutations found linked to either A230 or G230, as such
homoplasies are known to affect the parsimony-based inference
of SeqTrack [22]. Hence our analysis was based on intra-host
sequences derived from 48 horses from 19 yards for which both
location and sampling dates were known (including two horses
outside Newmarket). The inferred transmission events summa-
rized per horse are shown in Figure 3A while the distribution of
shared mutations between ancestor and descendant is shown in
Figure 3B. The transmission network suggests that mixed
infections are frequent, as 25 out of 48 horses exhibited common
mutations with two or more other horses, including the two horses
from outside of Newmarket (17 out of 48 if the reference sequence
is excluded). In addition, we observed up to five shared mutations
between horses, indicative of relatively wide transmission bottle-
necks (Figure 3B and Table S2). As mutations introduced during
the PCR amplification could bias these results, we repeated the
analysis with sequences found at least twice in one host and which
are highly unlikely to be the result of PCR errors. Although this
conservative data set included only 40 mutations, it still suggested
the presence of mixed infections (nine out of 37 horses) and loose
bottlenecks, with up to five shared mutations (e.g., between L25
and L42 excluding three homoplasious mutations, not shown). We
evaluated the compartmentalization between the yards by using
the Slatkin and Maddison method [23], previously applied to the
phylogeography of H5N1 IAVs [24]. The number of inter-yard
transmissions (S = 442) based on the maximum likelihood phylog-
eny was lower than those expected from simulations (p,0.001)
providing evidence of compartmentalization by yard. Additionally,
transmissions from yard E to other yards occurred more frequently
than expected by chance (Figure S4B). As expected based on
sampling dates, transmissions from yards L to E were less frequent
than expected despite both yards having the largest number of
horses sampled (n = 10 and n = 8, respectively, Figure S4A).
Hence, although there was an overall clustering by yard, there was
also evidence of specific inter-yard mixed infections.
Inferences from the transmission network
Additional analyses of the network revealed that horse E10 was
most central (relative betweenness = 0.19, average = 0.045,
SE = 0.008), requiring the fewest steps to access every other horse.
As such, horse E10 is influential for the spread of the virus during
the outbreak. Additionally, five other horses were critical for
transmission to a subtree of the network (i.e., articulation points).
For example, horse E07 was critical for transmission to E14, E09,
E15 and E10 and horse L25 was critical for the transmission to
L39, L44 and L40.
By fitting exponential random graph models to the directed
network, we compared the graph to a random network as well as a
network including the yard as an exogenous covariate. The latter
model was a better fit to the data (AIC: 820.74, BIC: 826.46 versus
AIC: 797.07, BIC: 808.52 with yard), suggesting that the yard a
horse belonged to might have played a role in the transmission
dynamics during the outbreak. Given the central role of some
horses in the spread of EIV during the outbreak, we looked for
evidence of superspreaders. Accordingly, the geometric distribu-
tion was the best fit to the data, very closely followed by the
negative binomial; this provides limited evidence of potential
superspreaders either as a result of the mode of transmission of
EIV or the relatively small sample size of the study (Table 2 and
Figure 3C) [25]. We also looked for individual factors associated
with increased transmission. Accordingly, there was no significant
relationship between the number of horses transmitted to and the
age of the horse, time since last vaccination, the number of vaccine
doses in the horses’ lifetime and shedding load (n = 15 after
removal of missing data).
Epidemiological analyses
The effective reproductive number Rt is the number of
secondary infections resulting from a single infectious individual
at time t [26], and a crucial parameter in infectious disease
epidemiology [26]. Rt can be estimated directly from the
transmission network; that is, by determining who infected whom
and thereby capturing individual variation in transmission.
Although reconstructing transmission networks is practically
difficult, we can use the pathways of transmission determined by
sequence data.
It is estimated that 1311 horses were kept in training in
Newmarket at the time of the outbreak [14], of which 899 were
tested and 306 were scored as infected during the outbreak
(Figure 4A) with the highest number of infected horses (57 cases)
detected on the 9th
of April. To calculate Rt at the start of the

outbreak following [27], we fitted an exponential growth rate l to
the EI incidence using a generalized linear model with Poisson
errors (see Methods). Converting l using the probability distribu-
tion function of the serial interval provided an Rt estimate of 1.4–
2.3 depending on the time-series and length used (weekly versus
biweekly)(Figure 4B). Using the serial intervals derived from
experimental data directly ([2] and Dataset S4), we obtained an Rt
estimate of 1.8. Using the reconstructed transmission network, we
estimated Rt over the course of the outbreak, which decreased
from 3.9 to around 1.5 during the period of epidemic growth,
before incidence declined and the epidemic went extinct
(Figure 4C). Our estimate of Rt was slightly higher if mixed
infections were taken into account but decreased faster (Figure 4C).
While these estimates are broadly similar, the network approach
may initially overestimate Rt because of under-sampling individ-
uals early in the outbreak (Figure 4C), whereas the epidemic
inference is relatively robust to sampling but it is subject to some
uncertainty as the time-series is very short (Figure 4B). The
network approach allows further dissection of transmission
pathways including those that result in mixed infections (red and
black lines in Figure 4C), which would not be apparent from
incidence data alone.
Discussion
Comparison of within-host viral populations between
experimentally and naturally infected horses
The genetic diversity of the HA1 gene described here resembles
that described in previous intra-host studies of RNA viruses
[2,3,28]. The sequences contained mutations at glycosylation or
antigenic sites and mutations causing stop codons that were likely
to be transmitted and these mutations could provide altered viral
fitness and hence influence transmission dynamics [29]. The
estimated mutation frequency was slightly higher than previous
estimates [2], which may be attributed to differences in strains and
horse immunity. Although erroneous inclusion of PCR and
sequencing errors can be difficult to account for, by aligning
sequences against a reference for nucleotide polymorphism
detection and using a high Phred quality score for identification
of these mutations, the number of false-positives is likely to be
limited. Additionally, previous experiments quantifying mutations
introduced by PCR errors suggest they only occur at a frequency
of 1E26
/nt/cycle under our experimental conditions [2].
The importance of sequencing beyond the consensus
The limited number of different consensus sequences obtained
indicates that one sequence per horse would be insufficient to
reconstruct the transmission dynamics during this outbreak.
Although we have sequenced only HA1, it is likely that even a
whole genome consensus sequence would still not be sufficient to
reconstruct a transmission network, thereby highlighting the
importance of intra-host sequencing data. This is in contrast to
previous studies that successfully reconstructed the transmission
dynamics of other RNA viruses, and notably Foot-and-Mouth-
Disease virus, from consensus sequences per host or per farm
[20,30,31]. The small number of consensus sequences is likely to
be the result of the short time-scale of the outbreak and the short
sequence analyzed. Most horses had only one dominant variant
and a variable number of minor variants with one to nine
mutations relative to the consensus sequence. However, for one
horse (L27) sampled on multiple days, the dominant variant
changed over the course of the infection (G230 followed by A230)
either as a result of variant evolution or a mixed infection with a
different variant. We have reported similar changes in within-host
consensus sequences of swine influenza in pigs and canine
influenza virus in dogs [3,18].
The number of sequences and mutations shared between horses
is indicative of relatively loose transmission bottlenecks in natural
EIV infection, with up to three variants and eight mutations being
shared between horses. However, it should be emphasized that
inferred transmission events should be treated with caution given
the limitations of the methodology used here (see Methods). In
particular, although single mutations can be transmitted, it is
extremely difficult in these cases to differentiate true transmission
events from noise due to de novo mutations and/or laboratory
artefacts. Clearly, transmission bottlenecks play a major role in
shaping viral diversity, although these will vary in magnitude by
virus and by mode of transmission. Indeed, Norovirus [32] and
HIV [33–35] are characterized by strong genetic bottlenecks of
transmission, with only a low proportion of variants being
transmitted.
Phylodynamics of EIV at the local scale
Taking Newmarket as a whole, the dominant viral population
fluctuated over the course of the outbreak from G230 to A230 and
back to G230. This change in the dominant lineage illustrates the
speed with which lineages can originate, circulate and become
extinct during outbreaks. Such genetic turnover may be due to
changes in environmental conditions (such as temperature and
relative humidity), varying densities of uninfected hosts and also
changes in the immune status of the population during the
outbreak, each of which will impose a distinct selection pressure on
the virus. Alternatively, it could simply reflect the inherently
stochastic nature of viral transmission.
The transmission network and the number of shared mutations
between yards suggests that the spread of EIV in Newmarket was

highly diffusive and that the training yard only played a minor role
in structuring the viral population. Additionally, our data shows
that EIV does not necessarily spread between horses sharing the
same yard. Indeed, EIV was likely transmitted between horses that
were kept in yards that were 2.7 km apart (yard E to L). Social
networks may better explain part of the transmission dynamics
especially as horses from different yards establish direct contact
during their daily routines, and which may also explain the fluid
dynamics seen in the transmission of human influenza virus
[36,37]. However, we have limited information on the contact
network between horses and yards, which constrains further
integrated social network analyses.
A small number of individuals are often disproportionately well-
connected [38], with potentially important implications for virus
transmission and control [25]. Such individual variation can both
affect disease extinction as well as the frequency of outbreaks, often
causing more explosive epidemics [25]. EIV exhibited limited
heterogeneity in transmission efficiency with certain individuals
appearing to be responsible for a large proportion of transmission
events. For example horse E10 was likely to have been highly
influential in the spread of EIV with ties to 10 other horses and
was probably the main reason for the large number of
transmissions from yard E. Other horses were critical for the
transmission to subtrees of the network. Isolating such horses
might have limited the spread of EIV during the outbreak.
However, we found no factors that were significantly associated
with individual transmission efficiency, although this may be due
to the small sample size. Clearly, future research on understanding
the factors (behavioural, genetic and/or immune history) that
determine the variation in transmission between individuals would
be useful in designing better control strategies. Also, greater
sampling density would be necessary to conclude anything more
firmly about the role of individuals in overall transmission.
Our estimates of Rt from sampled epidemic trees derived from
the network showed time-dependent variation, rapidly decreasing
during the period of epidemic growth. Given non-random under-
reporting and under-diagnosis in both time and space during the
outbreak, the reconstructed network is only partly known, which
may influence the estimation of Rt. On the other hand, Rt shows the
transmission potential of mixed infections more fully. The incidence
time-series was also relatively short, limiting the resolution of initial
Rt estimates (,1.8 but ranging from 1.4 to 2.3). While the direct
estimate was relatively consistent with the network approach, it was
lower than those from a recent outbreak in 2007 in Australia (2.04 in
peri-urban and 1.99 in rural areas) [39] and an outbreak in
racecourses across Japan in 1971 (2.08–5.02) [40]. These differences
may lie in the immune status of the populations. The Australian
outbreak affected naı̈ve horses (Australia being an EI free country
does not routinely vaccinate) and the Japanese outbreak took place
before widespread vaccination was common practice, while
vaccination coverage in the Newmarket horse population was
universal as a result of compulsory racehorse vaccination. No official
movement restrictions were instigated during the outbreak but
vaccination was carried out soon after initial diagnosis [16]. Thus,
the rapid decline in Rt may have been due to the depletion of
susceptible horses either as a result of exposure or vaccination.
Transmission dynamics at the yard level
Although a larger sample size will doubtless reveal more evidence
on intra-yard transmission, its relatively low frequency in the
current data suggests that the virus may be more routinely
transmitted in other locations than the training yard and via other
mechanisms than close contact. Despite the fact that horses spend a
considerable amount of time in the yard, they can mix with horses
from other yards during training, and the intensity of training
conditions in racehorses might facilitate transmission. Moreover,
intermediate hosts and fomites are likely to play a role in influenza
inter-yard transmission. There is mounting evidence on EIV
transmission over long distances, including wind-borne aerosol
spread over 1–2 km in a recent outbreak in Australia [41]; and, the
possibility of mechanical transmission by flies [42,43]. Our results
also suggest that implementing control measures within training
yards would be of limited value considering the level of inter-yard
transmission and the need to maintain training regimes for
thoroughbreds. Control strategies such as movement restrictions
to prevent further dispersal of horses incubating infection outside
Newmarket might be more feasible at a regional scale.
Mixed infections and their impact on transmission
dynamics
One of our most striking observations is the frequency and
range of mixed infections. The mixed infection of viruses from

different clades, as in L40 [2], was probably a consequence of the
long distance transportation of horses following the global racing
circuit. In 2003 alone, L40 competed in races in the UK, France
and Germany, which might explain how the mixed infection of
two divergent EIV lineages could have occurred. Interestingly,
L40 tested positive for EIV by ELISA or qPCR eight out of ten
times between April 15th
and May 8th
, suggesting that it could
have been infected continuously for a 23-day period, possibly as a
consequence of a mixed infection. Apart from this case, the intra-
host genetic diversity and the network reconstruction suggest that
approximately 52% of the sampled horses had mixed infections of
closely related variants (the exact number of transmitted variants
cannot be estimated, particularly for sequences that differ on one
nucleotide where de novo mutations and PCR artefacts cannot be
ruled out). Even when we used a ‘‘conservative’’ data set (i.e. only
sequences that had mutations in multiple clones in a horse), we
detected evidence of mixed infections (24%), suggesting that this
observation is unlikely to be the result of PCR or sequencing
artefacts.
Mixed infections could be the result of co-infections (i.e., a
heterogeneous viral population resulting from a single transmission
event) or super-infections (i.e., a mixed infection resulting from
multiple independent transmission events). In most cases, it is not
possible to differentiate between these mechanisms, although for a
co-infection to be feasible a super-infection must have occurred in
an individual earlier in the transmission chain. Mixed infections
are clearly the main pre-requisite for intrasubtypic reassortment,
shaping viral diversity during the course of an outbreak and
impacting on the global evolution of EIV [12]. Indeed, reassort-
ment may be occurring frequently among lineages that are
circulating within outbreaks, although our focus on HA1 meant
that we could not detect this process.
Mixed infections can have important implications for epidemi-
ological models (Text S1). Modifying a simple SEIR model
suggested that the level of reinfection is highly dependent on the
latent and infectious periods. If the latent and infectious periods
are long, like in a naı̈ve population [44], very rapidly almost all
infections will involve mixed infections. If vaccination results in
shorter latent and infectious periods [15], then fewer infections will
be mixed (40% in the parameterization in Figure 5), consistent
with our finding of 52% of horses with mixed infections. Epidemic
size also depends on whether infectious periods for mixed
infections are longer or shorter (i.e. longer infectious periods
would result in larger epidemics). Interestingly, the two horses with
mixed infections for which we have repeated nasal swabs tested
positive for EIV for seven (L27) and 23 days (L40), much longer
than the average three days observed in in vivo studies. Despite the
fact that these observations are consistent with our hypothesis, a
bigger sample size is necessary to support it and repeated sampling
of affected individuals during an outbreak will be required to
clarify this issue. Overall, our findings suggest that the prevalence
of mixed infections detected using genetic data should be
considered when investigating IAV dynamics as it could affect
the epidemic size.
Materials and Methods
Generation of viral sequence data
Nasal swabs were collected during the outbreak between March
and May 2003 [14]. We analyzed a total of 199 nasal swabs from
individual horses during the outbreak. Details of shedding and
date of sample collection are listed in Dataset S5.
RNA extraction, viral quantification by real-time PCR and
PCR analysis were performed as described in [2]. Briefly, we used
the QIAmp viral RNA mini kit following the manufacturer’s
instructions to extract viral RNA from nasal swabs (280 ml initial
volume). We used Superscript III (Invitrogen) and primers Bm-M-
1 and Bm-HA1 [45] to generate cDNA of the M and HA genes,
respectively. We performed qPCR using the QuantiTect Probe
PCR kit (Qiagen) with fluorogenic hydrolysis type probes
according to the manufacturer’s instructions and using the same
primers and probe as in [2]. All samples, no template controls,
positive and negative controls and plasmid standards were run in
triplicate for each run. We used Platinum Pfx (Invitrogen) and

primers Bm-HA1 and EHA1007rw to amplify HA1 as described
in [2]. We used the QIAquick Gel Extraction kit to gel purify PCR
products, which in turn were cloned using the Zero-Blunt TOPO
PCR Cloning kit for sequencing (Invitrogen) following the
manufacturer’s instructions. Clones were sequenced using fluores-
cent sequencing chemistry and ABI 37306l capillary sequencers at
the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute.
The sequences from each clone were then trimmed and assessed
for quality prior to assembly. Only contigs .903 nt were used for
subsequent analyses. Contigs were aligned against a consensus
HA1 sequence of A/equine/Newmarket/5/2003 using a bioinfor-
matics tool for mutation detection from viral sequences (Ramirez-
Gonzalez, Hughes, and Caccamo, in preparation). This provides
basic statistics relating to the number of stop codons, number of
synonymous and non-synonymous mutations, and location of
mutations (antigenic site, receptor binding site) for each sequence.
Nucleotide variants were considered real if their Phred score was
greater than 25. Nucleotides with a Phred score below that value
were considered identical to the consensus nucleotide. Sequences
containing high-quality insertions or deletions that altered the
reading frame were counted.
Sequence analysis
A total of 2361 sequences were generated, of which 2222 were
from horses in Newmarket. Yards were denoted A to W (Figure
S1). Individual samples were identified based on the yard ID and a
horse number (i.e. sample A01 was derived from horse 1 in yard
A). Mutations were annotated according to mutation type
(synonymous, non-synonymous), whether they were in glycosyla-
tion sites, antigenic sites or receptor binding sites. The sequence
diversity within each host was measured as the pairwise
uncorrected distance (p-distance) and the number of synonymous
(dS) and non-synonymous (dN) nucleotide substitutions per site
(ratio dN/dS), which was also estimated for the data set as a whole.
dN/dS was estimated using the Single Likelihood Ancestor
Counting (SLAC) algorithm available in the HyPhy software
package [46] with sequences with stop codons excluded. To
determine whether the number of shared mutations between pairs
of horses was non-random, mutations were randomly assigned to
the same number of horses the mutation was found in and the
assignment was repeated 100 times. Subsequently, the number of
pairs of horses sharing randomly assigned mutations was
compared to the observed data using a Chi-squared test.
To analyse sequences at the epidemiological scale, 283
sequences were collated from GenBank (Dataset S2). Sequences
from the outbreak were aligned with the publically available data
using MAFFT [47]. The phylogeny was reconstructed using the
maximum likelihood (ML) method available in RAxML [48],
employing the GTRGAMMA model with 500 bootstrap repli-
cates. Further, the yard for each sequence in the ML phylogeny
was assigned to the tips as a single character and we used the
Slatkin-Maddison test [23] to determine the extent of gene flow
between the viral populations in each yard. This test was
implemented in PAUP* 4.0 [49] to determine the number of
transmission events between yards using the DELTRAN parsi-
mony optimization algorithm. To assess the uncertainty of our
reconstruction of the minimum number of inter-yard transmission
events, we randomized the yards on the tree tips 1000 times and
repeated the parsimony optimization. The results were summa-
rized to determine whether transmission events between yards
inferred from the maximum likelihood tree were greater than the
frequency of the same events if the localities were randomly
distributed.
Network analysis
SeqTrack was used to trace the spatiotemporal dynamics of EIV
across Newmarket [22,50]. SeqTrack is a graph based algorithm
the reconstructs the most parsimonious genealogy from genetic
data. It is particularly suitable to infer transmission pathways
during disease outbreaks, where samples typically display low
levels of genetic diversity. As the algorithm does not take into
account multiple sequences from the same host, we reconstructed
the transmission network from the SeqTrack adjacency matrix for
each horse and subsequently for each yard. The reconstructed
network was compared to a random network with equal nodes and
edges as well as a network including the training yard as a
covariate using exponential random graph models [51,52]. We
used the approach of [25] to fit offspring distributions (poisson,
geometric and negative binomial) to the inferred transmission
network using maximum likelihood. A generalized linear model
with Poisson errors was used to determine whether the number of
out-degrees could be explained by the age of the horse, the time
since last vaccination, the number of vaccine doses or the shedding
load of the horse. The centrality of each horse was determined
using relative betweenness centrality [53,54]. This is a measure of
the influence the horse has in the transmission network as it counts
the number of steps that are required for it to infect every other
horse in the network. Articulation points were identified within the
network [55]. All analyses were performed using the R software
environment [56] and the network was drawn using the graph [57]
and Rgraphviz packages [58,59].
Epidemiological analyses
The outbreak investigation, sampling protocols and the method
used for establishing a positive diagnosis of equine influenza virus
were previously published [14]. R0 was estimated directly from the
infectious histories of 899 horses tested over the course of the
outbreak. The date of infection was determined based on the first
positive ELISA or the date when the viral copy numbers was
above 150 copies per microliter (due to the limits of false positive
detection in qPCR), whichever occurred first. The intervals
between infections were determined based on the time period
between positive nasal swabs determined by qPCR from different
experiments including [2]. These experiments were based on
natural transmission of H3N8 in naı̈ve and vaccinated horses
(heterologous or homologous vaccination) (Dataset S4). We
combined the data from these studies as the intervals between
infections did not vary significantly between studies (F3,19 = 3.27,
P = 0.8). We fitted Poisson, geometric and gamma distributions to
these intervals using maximum likelihood. A gamma distribution
(mean = 3.3 days, variance = 1.3) provided the best fit and had the
lowest AIC, thus was used for further calculations.
We estimated the initial growth rate of the epidemic (l) by
fitting an exponential curve to incidence data using a generalized
linear model with Poisson errors. We explored a range of intervals
for fitting, up to and including peak incidence; the short time-series
limited the fitting procedures for the shorter intervals but by peak
incidence, the rate of epidemic growth had potentially been
curtailed. We converted the estimated growth rate to measure R0
(initial Rt) using the serial interval from the transmission
experiments.
To calculate Rt over the course of the epidemic as in [60], we
used a resampling approach from the network to select a single
donor from possible lists of candidates with equal probability to
generate 100 epidemic trees. The number of secondary cases per
infected horse inferred from each tree was calculated and averaged
across the possible epidemic trees to provide a time varying

estimate of Rt and compared to the estimate from the network (i.e.,
taking into account mixed infections).
The implications of the mixed infections were addressed by
modifying the classical SEIR framework to estimate the frequency
of potential mixed infections and the impact of the epidemic (Text
S1).

phylogeny. Light blue represents the pre-divergence lineage, blue
the Eurasian lineage, purple the American lineage, red the
sublineage Florida Clade 1, and green represents sequences from
the Florida clade 2 sublineage. The arrow indicates the position of
the nine sequences from L40 as reported in [2].

Figure S4 Transmission dynamics at the yard level. (A)
Transmission network summarized according to yard. The circles
represent training yards and the size is relative to the number of
horses sampled in each yard. Dashed arrows are for yards that
only share the reference sequence. For all other arrows, the
number of shared mutations is shown within black boxes on the
arrow. Transmission events within a yard are shown with a curved
arrow. Yards that have the A230 mutation are shown with thicker
edges. (B) Frequency of character changes from one yard to
another determined by the mapping of yards as a character onto
the phylogeny from RAxML. The red points represent the
observed frequency of unambiguous character change. The
boxplot represents the summary from 1000 permutations (dark
horizontal segment shows the median, the box surrounds the first
and third quartiles, whiskers represent the 95% bounds and black
points mark outliers). The observed character changes (red points)
outside of the 95% bounds of the simulations (whiskers) represent
significant transmission pathways.
