Objective: Previous studies have suggested that breast cancer survival in Denmark has
improved, primarily in cancer patients without comorbidity. We therefore conducted a
­population-based cohort study to examine recent temporal changes in survival and mortality
among breast cancer patients with different extents of comorbidity.
Methods: We used population-based medical and administrative registries to identify breast
cancer patients diagnosed between 2000 and 2011 in the Central Denmark Region. We defined
comorbid diseases according to the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), including a history of
hospitalization for comorbid disease up to 10 years before breast cancer diagnosis. We studied
the impact of comorbidities on overall 1- and 5-year survival in different calendar time periods,
using a hybrid analysis for survival prediction in the most recent calendar periods.
Results: We included 9,329 breast cancer patients. The proportion of patients within different comorbidity categories remained stable from 2000 to 2011. One-year survival improved
from 91% in 2000–2002 to 95% in 2009–2011, while 5-year survival improved from 72% to
a predicted 78%. During the entire study period, comorbidity was a strong predictor of the
survival of breast cancer patients. However, we observed improvements over time in 1- and
5-year survival for all comorbidity groups. During the 12-year study period, the estimated 5-year
survival for patients with a high comorbidity disease burden (CCI score $3) increased from
25% to a predicted 50%, and their 5-year age-adjusted mortality hazard ratio (HR) fell from
4.0 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.0, 5.4) to 2.7 (95% CI: 2.0, 3.6), respectively, compared
with patients with no comorbid disease.
Conclusion: Survival of breast cancer patients diagnosed in the Central Denmark Region
improved from 2000 to 2011, regardless of the extent of comorbid disease.

Denmark currently has the second-highest breast cancer incidence and the highest
mortality from breast cancer in Europe.1 Breast cancer risk increases with age, so
breast cancer patients often have comorbid disease at the time of their breast cancer
diagnosis.2–4 In Denmark, this amounts to about 20% of all breast cancer patients.5
Several studies have documented that comorbid diseases negatively affect survival
after breast cancer.6,7 Mortality in these patients may often be related to the comorbidities rather than to the breast cancer,8,9 in particular among patients with extensive
comorbidity.10–12
Survival after breast cancer has improved in Denmark13 but, according to a
recent Danish population-based study, the 5-year survival of breast cancer patients

with a Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score of $3
has only increased from 42.0% in 1990–1994 to 43.5% in
2000–2004.14 Another previous Danish population-based
study reported slightly poorer survival over time among
breast cancer patients with severe comorbidity between
1995 and 2005.5 The aim of this paper was to study temporal
changes in mortality in a cohort of breast cancer patients
diagnosed between 2000 and 2011 by extent of comorbid
diseases, as defined by the CCI.15

dementia; connective tissue disease; ulcer disease; ­diabetes;
renal disease; cancer; and HIV/AIDS. Breast cancer diagnoses were excluded when we computed the CCI score.
Furthermore, cancer diagnoses within 60 days before the
breast cancer diagnosis were excluded from the calculations,
in order to eliminate possible nonspecific cancer diagnoses
related to the breast cancer diagnosis. We ­categorized comorbidities as none (CCI score = 0), medium (CCI score = 1–2),
or high (CCI score $3).

Materials and methods
Study population

Vital status

This population-based cohort study was based in the ­Central
Denmark Region, which has approximately 1.2 million
inhabitants. The Danish National Health service provides
universal, tax-supported health care, guaranteeing unfettered
access to all general practitioners and hospitals. Accurate
and unambiguous linkage of all registries at the individual
level is possible in Denmark by means of the unique civil
personal registration (CPR) number assigned to each Danish
inhabitant at birth or immigration.16

Identification of patients
with breast cancer
The Danish National Registry of Patients (NRP) contains
information on all discharges from nonpsychiatric hospitals
in Denmark since 1977 and from emergency room and outpatient visits at hospitals since 1995.17 Each hospital discharge
or outpatient visit is recorded in the registry with one primary
diagnosis and one or more secondary diagnoses classified
according to the International Classification of Diseases, 8th
edition (ICD-8) until the end of 1993, and ICD-10 thereafter.
Using the NRP, we identified all female patients with an
invasive breast cancer diagnosis (ICD-10 code C50) from
January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2011. Patients with breast
cancer diagnosed between 1977 and 1999 were excluded.

Comorbid diseases at breast
cancer diagnosis
To assess patient comorbidity, the CCI score was computed at
date of breast cancer diagnosis for each patient based on NRP
records up to 10 years preceding the date of the breast cancer
diagnosis (Table S1).15 The CCI has been adapted and validated for use with hospital discharge data for the prediction
of short- and long-term mortality.15,18 The following disease
categories are included: liver diseases; myocardial infarction;
congestive heart failure; peripheral vascular disease; chronic
pulmonary disease; cerebrovascular disease; hemiplegia;

Members of the study cohort were linked via their CPR
number to the Danish Civil Registration System to obtain
information on vital status.16 This registry has recorded all
changes in vital status and migration for the entire Danish
population since 1968, with daily electronic updates. The outcome was overall mortality defined as death from any cause.
Follow-up was through patient date of death, emigration, or
December 31, 2011, whichever occurred first.

Statistical analysis
The prevalence of comorbidity was computed in study
patients during four 3-year calendar time periods (2000–2002,
2003–2005, 2006–2008, and 2009–2011). For each comorbidity category, we constructed Kaplan–Meier survival
curves for the different calendar time periods. Next, we
used Cox proportional hazards regression to compute 1- and
5-year crude and age-adjusted hazard ratios as a measure
of relative overall mortality to assess the association of
comorbidity with mortality using a CCI score = 0 as the
reference category in each calendar time period. In the latter
periods, we predicted 1- and 5-year survival using a hybrid
analysis in which survival was estimated using the survival
experience of patients in the previous calendar time periods.19
Breast cancer stage and grade were considered to be causal
intermediates in the association between comorbidity and
mortality, thus not included in the analyses. The proportional
hazards assumption was assessed graphically and found to
be appropriate. All analyses were performed using SAS
software (v 9.2; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA). The
Danish Data Protection Agency approved the study (record
number 2009-41-3866).

Results
The study included 9,329 women diagnosed with breast
cancer between 2000 and 2011. As shown in Tables 1 and
S2, the proportion of patients across different CCI score
categories and individual comorbid diseases was relatively

constant over the 4 calendar time periods. The number of
breast cancer patient diagnoses increased markedly between
2000 and 2011, almost doubling for patients aged between
50 and 74 years. The proportion of patients aged 50 to 74
years increased markedly in each time period from 57% in
2000–2002 to 68% in 2009–2011. In contrast, the proportion
of patients aged 75+ years fell from 24% to 17%.

Survival
Table 2 presents survival and relative mortality across calendar periods and age groups. Overall, the 1-year survival
improved between 2000–2002 and 2009–2011, from 91%
to 95%, while 5-year survival improved from 72% to 78%.
The 1- and 5-year survival remained rather constant over
time among patients aged 15–49 years and for patients
aged $75 years, but increased from 93% to 97% and from
77% to 84%, respectively, for patients aged between 50 and
74 (Table 2).
Figure 1 shows the Kaplan–Meier survival curves for
breast cancer patients in the four calendar time periods
stratified by CCI score. For patients with a CCI score
of $3, survival improved markedly after the period
2000–2002.
Table 3 shows that patients with high CCI scores had
higher 1- and 5-year mortality compared with those with low
CCI scores, regardless of calendar period. However, 1-year
survival improved over time for all three CCI ­categories.
Most of the 1-year survival improvement in all CCI categories seemed to happen early in the study period, ie, between
2000–2002 and 2003–2005, in particular for the CCI
score $3 patients. 5-year survival also improved over time

seen among CCI score $3 patients – from 25% in 2000–2002
to a predicted 50% in 2009–2011 (Table 3).

Mortality
The mortality across calendar periods was rather constant
from 2003–2005 (Table 3). Compared with 1-year mortality
in patients with no recorded comorbidity, the adjusted 1-year
mortality hazard ratio (HR) for patients with a CCI score of
1–2 remained similar over time, ie, HR = 1.8 (95% confidence
interval [CI]: 1.3, 2.6) in 2000–2002 and HR = 1.9 (95% CI:
1.2, 2.8) in 2009–2011. The corresponding 5-year mortality
HRs were 1.4 (95% CI: 1.1, 1.7) in 2000–2002 and 1.8 (95%
CI: 1.5, 2.2) in 2009–2011. For patients with a CCI score
of $3, the adjusted 1-year mortality HRs compared with
patients with no recorded comorbidity were 5.4 (3.5, 8.5)
in 2000–2002 and 5.7 (3.6, 9.2) in 2009–2011. The 5-year
mortality HRs were 4.0 (95% CI: 3.0, 5.4) in 2000–2002 and
2.7 (95% CI: 2.0, 3.6) in 2009–2011, compared with patients
without comorbidity.

Discussion
This large, population-based study showed improved
1- and 5-year survival of breast cancer patients diagnosed
in the Central Denmark Region from 2000 through 2011.
Comorbidity was a strong predictor of breast cancer
survival. Nonetheless, we observed marked improvements in survival for all comorbidity groups. This survival
improvement over time was even seen among patients
with the highest comorbidity burden (CCI scores 3),
and corresponded to a decreased 5-year mortality HR
compared with patients with no comorbid diseases (CCI
score = 0).

Our study has both strengths and weaknesses. We used
nationwide administrative and medical registries with
prospectively collected data to identify breast cancer patients,
comorbid diseases, and vital status, thereby avoiding selection bias and loss to follow-up. We obtained our information
on breast cancer diagnoses from the NRP, which is regularly
updated, allowing us to include the newest available data on
breast cancer cases in Denmark. Moreover, the validity of
breast cancer diagnoses recorded in the NRP is high.20
We used the CCI as a measure of the comorbidity burden.
This index has been validated as a predictor of mortality
in breast cancer patients and is often used in breast cancer
research, allowing for comparison of our results with previous studies. The positive predictive values of diseases
included in the CCI collected from the NRP have been
shown to be high.21 However, as outpatient diagnoses were
first added to the NRP in 1995, our study may be prone to
nondifferential misclassification of the CCI score. Such
misclassification would result if the inclusion of outpatient
diagnoses increases the recorded comorbidity in the NRP
and the measured comorbidity burden over time. Outpatient
diagnoses are likely to be less severe than inpatient diagnoses,
which may have contributed to the improvement in survival
among patients with severe comorbidity. On the other hand,
the effect of including outpatient diagnoses since 1995 should
have resulted in a survival improvement before 2011, which
was not the case.5,14 Furthermore, we lacked information on
lifestyle-related risk factors (such as body mass index, smoking habits, and alcohol consumption), breast cancer stage,
cancer treatment, and medication prescribed for the comorbid
diseases, which could all affect the mortality rate.
We note relatively few patients with a CCI score $3, and
estimates were therefore imprecise. Nonetheless, our findings
are consistent with previous studies, which have indicated
higher mortality among breast cancer patients with comorbidity compared with those without comorbidity.5,14 There
are several plausible explanations for this survival disparity.
First, severe comorbidity could increase mortality independent
of breast ­cancer, which in itself has a good prognosis. Second,
women with extensive comorbid disease may have their cancer
diagnosed at a later stage because comorbidity may mask any
evidence of an underlying cancer.22 On the other hand, other
studies have found a higher prevalence of comorbidity in earlier
stages of breast cancer, probably because patients with comorbidity often require frequent medical care.23,24 Third, treatment
options may be restricted in patients with severe comorbidity,
who may not tolerate aggressive cancer treatment.25,26
Yet, in contrast to a recent Danish 5-year follow-up of
breast cancer patients diagnosed from 1990 to 2004, which did

not indicate any improvement in 5-year survival for patients
with a CCI score of $3,14 we observed a marked improvement
in predicted 5-year survival for patients with a CCI score of
$3 during the calendar period from 2000–2011. However, this
may be due to chance, because the survival of the 69 patients
diagnosed in the reference period (2000–2002) was relatively
poor compared with the following calendar time periods,
so it is difficult to make any conclusions on these findings.
Introduction of the national Danish mammography screening
program for women 50–69 years of age in 2007 is expected
to result in an increased number of patients in this age group,
which is consistent with our findings, as well as more patients
diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer and thereby in need
of less extensive treatment, since less extensive treatment
is well tolerated regardless of comorbidity level. This may
decrease the survival gap related to comorbidity.
Although comorbidity is associated with a poorer prognosis in breast cancer, we observed a modest improvement
in survival, which may suggest improved management of
breast cancer patients with comorbidity over time.
