Abstract
Objective: Estimate the seroprevalence of influenza A virus in various commercial poultry farms and evaluate specific risk
factors as well as analyze their genetic nature using molecular assays.
Materials and Methods: This report summarizes the findings of a national survey realized from October 2010 to May 2011
on 800 flocks in 20 governorates. Serum samples were screened for the presence of specific influenza virus antibodies using
cELISA test. Additionally, swab samples were tested by real time and conventional RT-PCR and compared with results
obtained by others assays. Phylogenetic and genetic analyses of the glycoproteins were established for some strains.
Results: Out of the 800 chicken and turkey flocks tested by cELISA, 223 showed positive anti-NP antibodies (28.7%, 95% CI:
25.6–32.1). Significantly higher seroprevalence was found among the coastal areas compared to inland and during the
autumn and winter. Broiler flocks showed significantly lower seroprevalence than layers and broiler breeders. The influenza
virus infection prevalence increased after the laying phase among layer flocks. In addition, AIV seropositivity was
significantly associated with low biosecurity measures. The Ag EIA and rRT-PCR tests revealed significantly higher numbers
of AI positive samples as compared to cell cultures or egg inoculation. All new strains were subtyped as H9N2 by real time
and conventional RT-PCR. Drift mutations, addition or deletion of glycosylation sites were likely to have occurred in the HA
and NA glycoproteins of Tunisian strains resulting in multiple new amino acid substitutions. This fact may reflect different
evolutionary pressures affecting these glycoproteins. The role of these newly detected substitutions should be tested.
Conclusion: Our findings highlight the potential risk of AIV to avian health. Strict enforcement of biosecurity measures and
possible vaccination of all poultry flocks with continuous monitoring of poultry stations may ensure reduction of AIV
prevalence and avoid emergence of more pathogenic strains.

Introduction
Avian influenza (AI) is a respiratory disease. Its severity depends
on many factors including host age, virus strain, and secondary
infections. The causative agent is prevalent worldwide. Influenza
A virus belongs to the family Orthomyxoviridae and the genus
Influenzavirus A, and is characterized by a segmented, single-
stranded, negative-sense RNA genome. This genus is subdivided
into 17 hemagglutinin (HA) and 9 neuraminidase (NA) subtypes.
AI virus infects domestic poultry, mammals and humans, and is
thought to have originated in migratory wild birds [1].
Influenza A viruses are classified as either highly pathogenic AI
(HPAIV), causing severe systemic disease with high mortality, or
low pathogenic AI (LPAIV) inducing relatively mild clinical signs
in broilers and drop in egg production in layers [2].
Recently, LPAIV H9N2 subtype has been isolated worldwide
from different types of terrestrial poultry [3,4]. Initially concen-
trated in Asia [5], outbreaks subsequently spread to Africa, the
Middle East [6,7], and America [8] causing significant economic
losses related to increased mortality and decreased production in
poultry industry [9]. It has also been reported that H9N2 avian
influenza virus can cross species barrier and infect humans [10].
Monitoring AI viral infections in domestic and wild birds is
therefore important to control animal diseases and prevent human
pandemics. Many state laboratories participate in the surveillance
of AI activity and contribute to the early recognition of newly
emerging epidemic strains [11,12].
Serological surveillance of antibodies against AIV is of great
importance in preventing and controlling AI infection. Identifica-
tion of both H and N subtypes is highly essential for epidemio-

logical studies. Nowadays, the majority of field surveys of LPAIV
are based on serological assays; molecular methods such as real-
time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR), which have been
proven superior regarding its sensitivity and suitability for high
throughput analyses [13], are used to follow up and confirm
seropositive cases.
The introduction of LPAIV in Tunisia in December 2009 has
led to the spread of the disease in many parts of the country. Up to
this date, there was no evidence on the ecology and the natural
history of AIV transmission in Tunisia bearing in mind that most
AIV outbreaks in humans and birds remain unpredictable and
difficult to control. Besides, H9N2 subtype was reported to cause
infection in humans [10] and public health officials, worldwide,
are concerned about AI epidemics because of its potential risk to
cross species barriers.
This report is the first study conducted on AIV infection in
chickens and turkeys in Tunisia. It summarizes the findings of a
national survey realized from October 2010 to May 2011 with
regard to influenza virus infections, phylogenetic characteristics,
proportion of infected flocks and associated risk factors.
Materials and Methods
Poultry flocks sampling and questionnaire administration
A cross sectional sero-epidemiological survey was assessed to
estimate the flock-prevalence of influenza A virus infection was
approved by the ministry of agriculture as a control and
surveillance study during the period from October 2010 to May
2011.
This study was carried out on commercial flocks reared in 20
governorates from northern, central and southern Tunisia. A total
of 800 flocks consisting of 187 layer, 453 broiler, 58 breeder broiler
and 102 turkey flocks were enrolled in this study. The majority of
sampled flocks were recorded as having respiratory symptoms,
mortality or drop in egg production. None of these flocks received
any influenza A virus vaccines. Layer flocks were of varying ages,
ranging from 3 to 83 weeks old (mean age 45), breeder broiler
were from 10–64 weeks old (mean age 37), the broiler flocks aged
from 23 to 62 days of age (mean age 33) and turkeys were from 4
to 18 weeks (mean age 11). Twenty blood samples were separately
collected from birds in each of the 800 flocks, centrifuged and
stored at 220uC for further serological analyses. This should allow
detection of AIV antibodies for a within-flock seroprevalence of
15% (5% type I error) and estimation of the between-flock
prevalence with 3% precision at the 95% confidence level
(expected prevalence was set at 50%, the value for which the
sample size required is the largest) [14]. In addition, cloacal and
tracheal swabs were also taken on 20 birds per flock. Given
financial constraints, analysis was finally limited to the samples
coming from only 400 of the 800 flocks.
All chicken sampling protocols were approved prior to the
beginning of the study by the biological animal security committee
of National Agriculture Ministry, and conducted by trained
veterinarians. Simultaneously, a more detailed questionnaire was
filled out to collect valuable information on the farm (poultry
species, premises, close environment, biosecurity, etc) and the
reared birds (age, health statue, vaccination program…). The
owners agreed to participate in such study and a written informed
consent document was obtained from each participating farm.
Competitive ELISA assay (cELISA)
Serological evidence of avian influenza virus was detected using
a Competitive Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (cELISA)
(ID-screenH Influenza A Antibody Competition ELISA Kit, ID-
Vet, Montpellier, France) specific to influenza A nucleoprotein
(NP) as described by Zhou et al [15]. The results were expressed as
the percentage of competition value according to the following
formula: (OD samples/OD negative)6100. Poultry flocks were
considered positive for antibodies to influenza A NP if the average
percentage of competition (mean value of 20 tested sera) is lower
than 45.
Statistical analyses. Statistical analyses were carried out
with the R software and the flock was considered as an
epidemiological unit. Between-flock prevalence and confidence
intervals were estimated using the epiR package.
Among the available data collected in the questionnaire, seven
categorical variables were selected to study the risk of AI infection
such as: area (geographical location of the farms), bird species,
nearby poultry farms – including backyard – within a radius of
500 m around the farmhouse, nearby humid zone (proximity to
river, lakes, swamps), biosecurity measures (building infrastructure,
equipments, farm management), owner/workers circulating be-
tween farms and contacts with migratory birds (wild birds
observed or not in the neighboring areas). These variables were
first entered in univariate logistic regression models, with flock
status (infected/not infected) as dependent variable. An initial
multivariate model was built based on all the predictors with
p#0.25 (LR test) in the univariate screening. Variable selection for
the final model was carried out through a backward elimination
process based on the log–likelihood ratio test as recommended by
Hosmer and Lemeshow (2000) [16]. Spatial autocorrelation
between flocks was taken into account by including governorate
as a random effect in the regression models. Between-flock
seroprevalence was mapped using a geographical information
system software (ArcGIS v.9.2ß
ESRI Inc.).
To ascertain the effect of age upon the susceptibility to influenza
virus infection, univariate logistic regression was also performed
for long cycle poultry systems (layers, broiler breeders, and
turkeys). Age was categorized into three categories based on the
laying phase (before 18 weeks, from 18 to 32 weeks, after 32
weeks).
Virus propagation and titration
Pooled swab (cloacal and tracheal) samples were propaged in
10-day-old SPF embryonated chicken eggs (ECEs) (Lohmann Ltz,
Germany). Infective amino-allontoic fluids (AAF) were harvested
at 96 h post incubation, tested for the presence of hemagglutinin
(HA) activity [17], and titrated to determine the 50% tissue culture
infective dose (TCID50)/ml, using primary chicken embryo
fibroblast cultures (CEFs).
Antigen enzyme immunoassay (Ag EIA)
An initial screening for AIV was done by AgEIA as described
(ID-screenH Influenza A Antigen Capture, ID-Vet, Montpellier,
France). In brief, the diluted swabs was mixed well and incubated
(50 ml/well) into a microwell coated with Influenza A (NP) specific
monoclonal antibodies for 25 min at room temperature. IgG
conjugated with horse radish peroxidase was then added (100 ml/
well) followed by color development with chromogen and
substrate. The Cut-off level was calculated as three standard
deviations above the mean optical density value of negative
controls (threshold = mean ODNC63SD). Pooled swab samples
having OD value above the threshold level were considered
positive.
CEF cell culture
Primary chick embryo fibroblast (CEF) cells were cultured from
SPF embryonated chicken eggs (Lohmann Ltz, Germany) (density

cells per well) in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium
(DMEM) (GibcoH, Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA)
containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 IU/ml penicillin G,
and 100 ml/ml streptomycin. The 80% confluency reached cells
were inoculated with 100 ml of AgEIA positive samples, at a
multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1:1 in DMEM with 5% FBS
supplemented with 2 mg/ml tosyl-phenylalanyl chloromethyl
ketone (TPCK)-Trypsin (GibcoH) [18]. The supernatants were
10-fold diluted to calculate the infectious virus titer by determining
the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) using the Reed and
Muench method.
Hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) test
An HI test was carried out using reference influenza A virus sera
(kindly provided by FAO) of known anti hemagglutinin (HA)
antibody (H5, H7, H9) titers as recommended in standard
protocol [17]. The HI titer was expressed as the reciprocal of
the highest serum dilution that completely inhibits hemagglutina-
tion. Serum samples indicating ,8 HI titer were regarded as
negative.
RNA extraction
Viral RNA extraction was carried out using TRIzolH (Invitro-
gen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) as recommended by the manufacturer.
The concentration and the purity of the extracted total RNA were
determined by measuring the absorbance ratio at wavelength
260 nm over 280 nm using a spectrophotometer.
Identification of Influenza A viruses
Real time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) for IA typing and
subtyping. Ag EIA result’s confirmation was done by a real-
time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR)
using One-Step Qiagen RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany)
with primers and probes (Table S1) targeting the conserved region
of the matrix (M) gene [19]. AIV positive samples were tested for
H5, H7 [19] and H9 [20] subtypes following the described
protocols. Samples with threshold (Ct) values ,35 were considered
positive.
Conventional RT-PCR
The amplification of H9 and N2 genes was carried out
separately with primers published by Ji [21] and Kwon [22],
respectively. PCR products were run on 2% agarose gel, stained
with ethidium bromide and visualized by UV illumination. The
product was purified and extracted from the agarose gel with the
Gel Kit (GenCleanH II kit, North America, Solon Ohio). The
DNA was quantified by NanoDropH ND-1000 Spectrophotometer
(NanoDrop Technologies, Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA) and five
10-fold dilutions of the DNA were performed and tested by real-
time RT-PCR.
Viral HA and NA gene’s sequencing and phylogenetic
analysis
The DNA templates were purified and sequenced by the Big
Dye TerminatorH v1.1 sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, CA,
USA). Post sequencing products were purified prior to running on
3730 XL DNA (ABI Prism 377, DNA sequencer, Applied
Biosystem Inc., CA, USA) Analyzer.
Sequences were aligned using the Bioedit 5.0.6 program. The
two segments were phylogenetically analyzed on the basis of their
protein sequences. The MEGA5.01 version 3.65 program was
used for tree building using the neighbor-joining method. The
number of bootstrap replications was set to 1000. All branches
supported by more than 50% bootstrap values were considered to
be in the same group in the trees. Abbreviations used and
GenBank accession numbers of different H9N2 viruses included in
the phylogenetic analysis are listed in supplementary Table S2.
Accession numbers
The GenBank sequence accession numbers for the two
segments HA and NA of the four isolates included in this study
are JQ952588 through JQ952592.
Results
Clinical signs
Flock records and survey sheets describing the clinical signs
observed in the visited farms indicated a mortality rate of 10% to
30% with moderate to severe respiratory symptoms in broiler
flocks. Infected layer, broiler breeder and turkey flocks showed
moderate respiratory symptoms and severe drop in egg produc-
tion.
Seroprevalence and risk factor analysis
Out of the 800 chicken and turkey flocks tested by competitive
cELISA, 223 showed positive anti-NP antibodies. Figure 1
indicated positive sera peak at about 6–10% competition and
3% were considered doubtful. The overall between-flock sero-
prevalence was 28.7% (95% confidence interval, CI, 25.6–32.1).
The highest levels of seroprevalence were observed during autumn
and winter with a peaked in March at 37.2% (CI 24.1–51.9)
(Figure 2). Highest seroprevalences were observed in Tunis
(47.9%, CI 36.1–59.9), Nabeul (45.7%, CI 35.4–56.3) and Sfax
(41.3%, CI 34.4–48.4) governorates where the majority of
commercial farms are located (Figure 3).
Of the 7 candidate risk factors, 5 were significantly associated
with avian influenza at p,0.25 (Table 1) and were selected for
inclusion in the multivariate modeling process. Four variables were
found significantly associated with the risk of AIV infection in the
final model (Table 2). It appeared that between-flock seropreva-
lence is significantly higher (p,0.05) in farms on the coast
including Bizerte, Tunis, Nabeul, Sousse, Mahdia, Monastir and
Sfax as compared to the inland farms (Figure 4; Table 1).
Interestingly, seroprevalence in broiler flocks (17.6%, CI 14.2–
21.5) was also significantly lower than that seen in layers (50.3%,
CI 42.6–57.4) and broiler breeders (46.5%, CI 33.3–60.1)
(Table 2).The risk of AIV infection was significantly higher for
commercial farms with low biosecurity level (sanitary and
management failures) as compared to those showing medium to
high biosecurity measures (better sanitary and management
measures applied) (Table 1).
To a lesser extent (p = 0.09), the risk of AIV was found
associated with the presence of a poultry farm in a 500-m radius.
The influenza virus infection was less prevalent during young
age (,18 weeks) than during the laying phase and after for layers
and breeder broilers (Table 3).
Virological analyses
Out of the 400 tested flocks, 40 (10%) were positive by Ag
ELISA for NP antigen and by rRT-PCR for M gene (ct value in
the range of 15–33). Among them, only 29 samples showed
cytopathic effect in chicken embryo cell (CEC) cultures, charac-
terized by plaque formation only in the presence of trypsin
(Figure 5). Chicken embryos inoculated with the selected samples
died within 24–72 hr in only 20 cases. The HA assays revealed
that the HA titers ranged from 5 to 9 log2. HA subtyping was done
by HI test using H5, H7, and H9 specific antisera, for 20 out of the

40 positive samples. They were all identified as H9 subtype with
HI titer ranging from 4 to 8 log2. None of them were identified as
H5 and H7 subtypes. Besides, all rRT-PCR positive samples for
gene M detection were also identified as H9 subtype by the same
specific assay.
The specificity of the primers was examined by rRT-PCR, using
template extracted from H5N1, H7N3, H1N1 and other avian
viruses, including Newcastle disease, infectious bronchitis and
infectious bursal disease viruses. None of the above viruses showed

a positive result, indicating that primers used were indeed highly
specific to avian influenza A virus and H9 subtype.
The detection and the quantification of AI viral titer were
performed by rRT-PCR using various amounts of purified DNA
(3.7 ng/ml) or TCID50 values (106
TCID50/ml). As shown in
Figure 6, the analysis of threshold cycle (Ct) signals as function of
log10 concentrations and TCID50 titers showed a nearly linear
decrease of Ct value with increased virus titer. The detection limit
of rRT-PCR was 3.761025
ng/ml (while by RT-PCR, the limit
was 3.761022
ng/ml) or 1 TCID50/ml, respectively. The corre-
lation coefficient R2
value was 0.99, indicating linear regression
between the standard curve line and the individual Ct data points.
It seems that the confirmation of Ag EIA positive results was
high by rRT-PCR, but low as compared to Cell culture and egg
inoculation.
In addition, conventional RT-PCR detected a 1500 bp and a
410 bp products specific to the H9 and N2 genes respectively.
Four isolates from areas with the highest seroprevalence
(Nabeul, Sfax and Tunis) were selected for HA and NA gene
sequencing to discuss molecular evolution during H9N2 AIV
outbreaks. Mixed speculations were chosen: broiler, layer, broiler
breeder and turkey within the AIV isolates correspond to several
seasons.
Phylogenetic analysis of HA (Figure 7a) and NA (Figure 7b)
sequences revealed that the four isolates belonged to the Eurasian
clade and fell within the same G1-like lineage. All isolates
identified during 2011 and 2010 were most closely related
(similarity out of 96%) to the A/Migratory Bird/TUN/51/2010
and A/Ck/TUN/12/2010 previously isolated.
Multiple alignment of the HA gene (Table 4) revealed that these
strains have the same P-A-R-S-S-R Q G amino acid motif at the
cleavage site and carried the aa substitution Q234L (H9
numbering) that correlated with a shift in affinity to human type
SA a2,6 receptor type. The current isolates maintained conserved
residues at the receptor-binding pocket: P116, T163, H191, A189
and I235.
The N-linked glycosylation sites are conserved at positions 82,
105, 141, 218, 298, and 305 in the HA1. Additional glycosylation
site was found at aa position 166 in all Tunisian isolates expect the
CK/TUN/2019/10 H9N2 strain which carries another glycosyl-
ation at residue 183 (Table 4).
The CK/TUN/345/11 H9N2 variant conserved V and Y at
position 253 and 265, respectively compared with the previously
identified strains MB/TUN/51/10 and CK/TUN/12/10, while
the three other variants carried V253I and Y265F substitutions.
The NA genes of the 2010–2011 isolates differed from
previously identified Tunisian strains by six aa substitutions:
N356D, V360A, T384N, Q432K and S442H, I444V (except CK/
TUN/345/11 variant). In addition, the two 2011-strains exhibited
three new mutations S400R, N402D and G451R.
The framework and the hemadsorption sites of the NA contain
R371
, A372
, N402
, E425
and K367, L370, A372, D401, Y406
respectively.
Discussion
The current study attempted to monitor AIV in commercial
poultry flocks and investigate possible risk factors associated with

AI seroprevalence at the farm level. The poultry industry,
composed of broilers, layers, broiler breeders and turkeys, is one
of the most developed animal sectors in Tunisia. In 2008, the
number of commercial farms has been estimated at 3.000, with
84.000 poultry. Poultry meat production, estimated to be
160.000 tons in 2010 represented 56% of the total meat
production in Tunisia. The traditional sector, representing 2.9
millions of laying hens and 1.4 millions of chickens, also
contributes to poultry production and food security in the country
[23]. In 2006, rumors following the detection of highly pathogenic
avian influenza in poultry farms on the African continent had an
economic impact of 19 million dollars on the Tunisian poultry
industry [23].
The national surveillance network of myxoviruses (Avian
Influenza and Newcastle Disease Viruses) has been set up since
2006 and has been very successful. It has contributed to the early
detection of the first introduction of AI in Tunisia in December
2009, and allowed the follow up of its evolution, from the north to
the center and the south of the country, especially in layer flocks
[24].
The study showed some limitations that should be taken into
account before conclusions are drawn. First, seroprevalences
should be regarded cautiously as the 800 flocks enrolled in the
present study may have not been chosen randomly among all
Tunisian commercial poultry farms. Indeed, questionnaire showed
that most of the farms enrolled reported clinical signs. This study
may thus not depict the overall AIV situation in Tunisia, but
certainly provides a precise description of the AIV seroprevalence

in Tunisian flocks showing clinical signs. Second, the number of
poultry samples collected in the field varied greatly according to
the month of year and the governorates. This makes the
interpretation of geographical and temporal variations difficult,
due to the heterogeneity of seroprevalence confidence intervals.
Also, the temporal pattern of seroprevalence should be considered
in regard to the persistence of AIV antibodies in poultry over the
course of time. Further longitudinal studies, based on random
sampling of farms and birds and carried out over longer periods of
time, are desirable to address these limitations. At least, the

questionnaire survey resulted in missing information for 176 of
800 farms. These farms were excluded from the statistical risk
factor analysis, but the influence of missing values on the
robustness of results could not be deeply analyzed. Despite these
limitations, this study brings new insights to the epidemiology of
avian influenza in the Maghreb and Mediterranean countries.
The overall between-flock seroprevalence of AIV antibodies was
28.7% (CI 25.6–32.1), which demonstrates that AIV was present
in Tunisia during 2010 to 2011. The cELISA, was assessed as
sensitive, specific (100%, respectively as provided) versus (95% and
96% in chickens, 86% and 88% in ducks, 97% and 100% in
Turkeys, 87% and 100% in goose, and 91% and 97% in swine)
and reliable tool for the study of AIV epidemiology [25]. Besides,
previous studies suggested that cELISAs should be effective for a
large-scale surveillance of AIV in avian and other species [26]. A
higher AIV seroprevalence (71,3% ) was reported in adults birds
by Toennessen et al. [27]. Interestingly, our finding is consistent
with the high flock-seroprevalence recorded previously on chicken
flocks experiencing respiratory signs or mortality in Jordan [28]
and Egypt [29].

We found that high seroprevalences were observed in the
coastal areas, where most commercial farms are located,
compared to the inner regions of the country. This result may
reflect an intense low pathogenic AI circulation in areas with high
densities of poultry farms and slaughterhouses, as it has previously
been described for the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus [30].
In this report, we also evidenced that AIV infection may be
maintained over several consecutive months in Tunisian commer-
cial flocks. Additional longitudinal prevalence studies would be
necessary to examine temporal variations of AIV infection,, but
our results nevertheless suggest that AIV circulation may be more
important throughout autumn and winter than in spring. The
temporal fluctuations of AIV seroprevalence in this study probably
reflect different proportions of poultry types sampled from one
month to another. Indeed, broiler flocks – which showed lower risk
of AIV seropositivity than layers, breeders or turkeys – represented
the majority (more than 75%) of the flocks sampled in April and
May, when seroprevalence was low (,20%). However this may
not be the only explanation for monthly variations as seroprev-
alence remained over 25% in January and March, with broilers
representing 64% and 62% of the flocks sampled at that period of
time. It has also been suggested that AIV prevalence may vary
with contacts between poultry and wild birds and virus survival
under environmental conditions, including temperature [31]. At

Avian Influenza Infection in Commercial Poultry

last, between-flock seroprevalence might also be influenced by the
seasonality of poultry production and trade in Tunisia.
Our study showed higher prevalences for layer (50.3%) and
broiler breeder flocks (46.5%) compared to broiler chickens.
Recent report also suggested that broiler flocks were less affected
with H9: only 1/9 (11.1%) flocks were found seropositive to H9
versus 13/18 (72.2%) and 7/12 (58.3%) for H9, in the examined
layer and breeder poultry farms, respectively [32]. In fact, the long
life span of layers and broiler breeders allows the development of a
stronger immune response, as a result of the longer exposure to the
risk of AI infection. This phenomena might explain the higher
prevalence detected by cELISA as compared to broilers, which
have a short life span and for which the blood samples may have
been collected at the acute stage of infection. Results suggest that
for the layer flocks, the AIV infection may have occurred during
the laying phase and increased after. These findings may help to
explain the observed drop in egg production.
Interestingly, a large proportion of flocks more than 4 weeks old
and unvaccinated were found to be infected with AIV. This
suggests a direct exposure of Tunisian commercial flocks to AI.
Similar finding found that 5 weeks old chicks were more likely to
have produced antibodies in response to AIV infection than those
of 3 week old [33].
In addition, our survey showed that the biosecurity level of
poultry farms was significantly associated with the risk of AIV
infection. Commercial poultry sector in Tunisia includes various
farm management conditions with low-biosecurity level (wooden
or open poultry premises, products sold on local markets), which
presents high risk regarding AIV infection (OR = 1.57, CI 95%: 1–
2.4), to higher-biosecurity level observed in many industrial farms
with birds kept in a closed house, maintaining highly restricted
physical barriers and applying strict disinfection and hygienic
procedures (elimination of infected flocks to limit possible AIV
spread). Besides, the poultry producers seek assistance for diseases
diagnosis through professionals and dedicated trained personnel
and reinforcement of biosecurity measures.
No association was found in our work between the risk of AIV
and the possible contact with migratory birds, as well as with
owner/workers circulating between farms. However, the increased
number of seropositives in farms located within the migratory
route of wild birds was approved in previous study [28,34]. More
comprehensive questionnaires and studies should be done to better
elucidate the role of these factors.
The screening for the AIV infections in flocks was performed by
Ag ELISA and confirmed by rRT-PCR using M primers allowing
detection of AIVs type A.
Tissue cultures (CEF) were used as another indicator for the
presence of the virus. None of the H9N2 isolates tested showed
cytopathic effect (CPE) in infected CEF monolayer in the absence
of trypsin whereas CPE could be observed by 72 h post infection
in presence of trypsin, in 29 out of 40 samples. This clearly
indicated that the Tunisian H9N2 isolates are of low pathogenic-
ity, which is further supported by sequencing data results.
Our findings also demonstrated that Ag EIA has higher
sensitivity than virus detection through egg and cell culture
inoculations and underlined its potential and value in IA routine
diagnostic.
Positive cases were then subtyped by both HI test using specific
H9 polyclonal antisera and rRT-PCR assay followed by conven-
tional RT-PCR using subtype-specific primers for the genes H9
and N2, respectively. The rRT-PCR assay for M and H9 genes
revealed significantly higher numbers of positive samples, and
confirmed all the positive results revealed by AgELISA. All new
strains were subtyped as H9N2 by real time and conventional RT-
PCR
The standard curve was generated from Ct values plotted
against viral titers expressed as diluted H9 DNA concentrations or
as 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID50)/ml. Interestingly,
rRT-PCR test, which can rapidly identify type A influenza as well
as subtype H9, was very useful for the screening of AIV. It can also
be a very valuable tool for the control of the disease transmission in
poultry and in humans and can help reducing economic losses
associated with AIV outbreaks in poultry.
Real time RT-PCR assay offered several advantages over
conventional RT-PCR and other virological detection assays such
as Ag EIA, hemagglutination inhibition or cell cultures. In
addition to the relatively short run time, rRT-PCR is a
quantitative assay and can be used for absolute or relative viral
RNA quantified. This TaqMan- probe-based RT-PCR assay
targeted the M and the HA genes of AIV. It has been reported
that the rRT-PCR, used for the detection of human and avian
influenza viruses, is very sensitive (2 copies of in vitro-transcribed
RNA or 0.05 TCID50 per reaction) and highly specific [20].
Phylogenetic analyses based on the HA and NA genes revealed
that current Tunisian (H9N2) variants are closely related to each
other and to Middle Eastern strains with a similarity score of up to
96% within the members of the G1 lineage. Interestingly, 2010–
2011 Tunisian H9N2 strains belong closely to the same clade as
the MB/TUN/51/2010 H9N2 strain previously isolated from
migratory bird [24]. In fact, our surveillance study was carry out
during the seasonal coming of migratory bird and phylogenetic
analysis may underline the role of wild birds in the introducing of
the virus. It has been suggested that the migratory birds play an
important role in the virus introduction but that the spread of AIV
to other wild and domestic species, present in their migratory
pathways may be limited [29,34]. Environmental persistence of
the virus in various aquatic habitats (lakes, rivers, ponds) of wild
bird population may play a key role in its transmission within
animal population and its persistence in the environment [35].
Previous study showed that H9N2 viruses are transmitted by the
tracheal route via aerosol mode and a lesser extent by feces [36].
The spreading mode could be by the contact with wild and aquatic
birds, leadding to an interspecies transmission and great variability
in host-range restriction and genetic diversity [35,37].
The cleavage site motif PARSSR*GLF consistent with the
characterization of LPAI and the presence of Leu (L) at position
226 of all isolates indicated their binding potential with SA a 2,6
receptor [38]. New additional glycosylation was shown at aa
residue 183 of the Ck/TUN/2019/10 isolate, but whether this
change might affect the viral characteristics needs to be further
explored.
Moreover, three specifically Tunisian variants carried new
V253I and Y265F substitutions previously observed in Saudi
Arabian, Israeli and Pakistani strains. The role of these
substitutions should be examined.
NA gene was more polymorphic: drift mutations have occurred
in the framework and the hemadsorption sites in the variants
resulting in 9 substitutions. Three were non- synonymous
substitutions. Three substitutions V360A, T384N, Q432K, not
similar to the two Tunisian identified strains, were previously
found in H9N2 reference strains (such as Saudi Arabia, Israel and
G9 strains). Only current Tunisian isolates harbored three new
mutations N356D, S442H and I444V similar to other N2 subtypes
(H1N2, H6N2, H5N2, H7N2, H3N2 and H2N2). Interestingly,
three S400R, N402D and G451R substitutions found exclusively
in 2011 Tunisian strains. However, the biological significance of
these mutations is not yet known.

PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 11 January 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 1 | e53524
Considering substitutions detected in the isolate from turkey, it
is interesting to evaluate adaptative mutations in the new host. In
summary, these drift mutations and the addition or deletion of a
glycosylation site may reflect different evolutionary pressures
applied to the two glycoproteins HA and NA.
A total of 120 out of 400 flocks that was negative in rRT-PCR
assay, showed positive reactions for anti-NP antibodies in cELISA.
This lower detection rate revealed by rRT-PCR may be related to
the fact that AIV is present for a short period after initial infection
and replicates poorly in the host, whereas the antibody responses
last longer after infection.
For the 22 flocks revealed positive by rRT-PCR, cELISA was
negative; this may suggest that the humoral response was not yet
detectable.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the current study showed evidence that AIV
H9N2 strains are present in commercial different poultry species
and regions of Tunisia, which highlights the potential risk of AIV
infections.
Determining the subtype of the circulating AIV is very
important to understand its evolutionary relationship with local
as well as regional strains. Subsequently, amino acid substitutions
in HA and NA proteins that are located at antigenic sites, require
constant evaluation of the best possible vaccine candidates.
Strict enforcement of biosecurity measures and possible
vaccination of all poultry flocks with continuous monitoring of
poultry stations may ensure reduction of AIV prevalence and
avoid emergence of more pathogenic strains.
