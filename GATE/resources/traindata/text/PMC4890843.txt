Collider Bias Is Only a Partial Explanation
for the Obesity Paradox
Matthew Sperrin,a Jane Candlish,a Ellena Badrick,a Andrew Renehan,b and Iain Buchana

Background: “Obesity paradox” refers to an association between
obesity and reduced mortality (contrary to an expected increased
mortality). A common explanation is collider stratification bias:
unmeasured confounding induced by selection bias. Here, we test
this supposition through a realistic generative model.
Methods: We quantify the collider stratification bias in a selected
population using counterfactual causal analysis. We illustrate the bias
for a range of scenarios, describing associations between exposure
(obesity), outcome (mortality), mediator (in this example, diabetes)
and an unmeasured confounder.
Results: Collider stratification leads to biased estimation of the
causal effect of exposure on outcome. However, the bias is small relative to the causal relationships between the variables.
Conclusions: Collider bias can be a partial explanation of the obesity paradox, but unlikely to be the main explanation for a reverse
direction of an association to a true causal relationship. Alternative
explanations of the obesity paradox should be explored. See Video

“O

besity paradox” is the term given to the finding that, in
certain populations, people who are obese seem to live
longer. This has been observed in patients with coronary artery
disease,1 heart failure,2 and type 2 diabetes,3,4 among others.
Proposed explanations for the paradox include5: body

This article focuses on the collider stratification bias5,8
explanation: a correlation induced between an exposure and
confounder when stratifying on a third variable (collider)
that is associated with, and downstream from, both.9 If the
confounder also affects the outcome, conditioning on the collider can induce a false, strengthened, or reversed association
between exposure and outcome.
Existing literature has demonstrated that collider stratification bias can occur in principle.5,8 However, it is not known
whether the conditions under which effect reversal occurs are
realistic. The aim of this article is to investigate the plausibility of collider stratification bias as an explanation for the obesity paradox under a realistic generative model.

METHODS
Derivation
We give a general description of collider stratification
bias, using the obesity paradox to illustrate, beginning with some
definitions from counterfactual causal analysis.10,11 Referring to
Figure 1, our interest is in the relationship between the exposure
A (e.g., obesity) and the outcome Y (e.g. mortality), complicated by a mediator M (e.g., diabetes status) and a confounder
U , which may be unmeasured. U is assumed (unconditionally)
independent of A. Suppose that U and A have distributions FU
and FA, respectively. While our derivations allow the variables
U and A to take any form, the mathematics is clearer if we consider the binary case, with P[U = 1] = pU , P[ A = 1] = p A, and
the other two variables generated by regression equations:
g M (E[ M | A, U ]) = α 0 + α A A + αU U + α AU AU

(1)

gY (E [Y | M , A, U ]) = β0 + β M M + βU U + β A A + β AM AM , (2)
with g M , gY = logit, with inverse: expit (x) = (1 + exp(− x)) .
−1

We are interested in the causal effect of A on Y (obesity
on mortality), conditioned on M being at level m (diabetes
status), i.e., a comparison in which A is set (counterfactually)
to level a or a* (e.g., obese or nonobese):

where δ represents a difference between the two expectations.
However, we calculate the association:
∆ AS = δ (E[Y |M = m, A = a], E[Y |M = m, A = a*]),
in which we compare individuals observed at exposure levels a and a*. Effect sizes of interest may be a (log) risk ratio
or (log) odds ratio. The obesity paradox explained by collider
stratification bias argument follows from the noninequality of
the above measures. A scenario of particular interest is when
the association is the reverse of the causal effect.
The nonequality of ∆ CE and ∆ AS is possible because
E[Y A= a |M = m] = ∑E[Y A= a |m, u]P[u|m] = ∑E[Y |m, a, u]P[u|m],

while
E[Y |M = m, A = a] = ∑E[Y |m, a, u]P[u|m, a].

In general, P[u|m] ≠ P[u | m,a] because conditioning on
M induces a relationship between U and A.
Following similar lines to the study of Vanderweele,12
the above can be computed:
E[Y |m, a, u] = gY−1 ( β0 + β M m + βU u + β A a + β AM am),
P[m|u, a]P[u | a]
P[u|m, a] =

Both the causal effect and association are a weighted
average of expit(β0 + β M + βU ) and expit(β0 + β M ), but the
weights differ depending on the status of A and U , so a spurious association may be observed.

The model is described by Figure 1, and regression
Equations (1, 2). We supposed that the only data available
are those with M = 1 (e.g., those with diabetes). We visualized the discrepancy between the association and causal effect
for a range of parameter values. The collider bias variables
α A , αU , α AU , and βU were varied over a grid from −3 to 3; this
range captures the salient features, and covers the range of
parameters that may reasonably be observed in practice. We
considered two scenarios for β A : no causal effect (β A = 0), and
some causal effect (β A = 1). Throughout we set pU = p A = 0.5,

right panel of Figure 5), i.e., when all the parameters on the
confounding pathway are substantially larger than the causal
effect. The association in the reverse direction is small, amplified slightly by antagonism between A and U (α AU = −1).

RESULTS

Contrary to much recent literature, our results suggest that collider bias alone cannot fully explain the obesity
paradox, with only small discrepancies between the association and the causal effect observed. For large discrepancies to
occur (e.g., for the association to reverse the causal effect), the
parameters on the collider bias pathway must be large compared with the true causal effect. This could only happen if
the true causal effect is small, and therefore unlikely to be
important; or the effect of the unmeasured confounder on both
the mediator and the outcome is very large, therefore unlikely
to be missed from the analysis.
Glymour and Vittinghoff14 also demonstrated that collider bias must be very strong to lead to an association that
reverses the causal effect, and Greenland15 gave a formula
for calculating the maximum observable bias. Banack and
Kaufman16 studied the strength of collider bias required to
reverse a particular causal effect. While they concluded that
such a reversal was plausible, strong relationships along the
collider stratification bias pathway are nevertheless required.
Collider stratification bias does not apply when the population
is unselected, so our finding is supported by a similar protective effect of obesity in the general population.17
For certain nonzero configurations of the model parameters, there is no bias in the estimation of the causal effect
(e.g., the crossing of the x axis in right panel, Figure 2). This
is unfaithfulness, which occurs when a multiplicative model is
induced in the risk scale.14,18,19

Figures 2 and 3 visualize the association between A and
Y when there is no causal effect. Figure 2 looks at the impact of
each of the collider stratification bias variables α A , αU , α AU , and
βU , one at a time; in each case the remaining variables are set to 1,
except α AU = 0. The left panel of Figure 2 shows that when α A
is positive (with αU = 1,βU = 1, α AU = 0), the observed association between A and Y is negative. This represents a bias because
the causal effect is zero. In the diabetes example, this means that
in a diabetes population where A (obesity) and U both increase
the risk of M (diabetes), and U also increases the risk of Y
(death), but A has no effect on Y except through M , we observe
a negative association between A and Y . Similar results are seen
for the other parameters. In Figure 3, each row in the lattice corresponds to a value of α A, while each column corresponds to a
value of βU . Within each graph, αU is varied from −3 to 3, and
we consider no interaction (α AU = 0, solid line) and antagonistic interaction (α AU = −1, dotted line). The bottom right panels
of Figure 3 illustrates that when α A , αU , and βU parameters are
positive, the association between A and Y becomes negative.
Figures 4 and 5 visualize the association, and causal
effect, between A and Y when there is a causal effect, β A = 1.
Obesity paradox occurs when the association has the opposite
sign to the causal effect. The direction of bias between the
association and causal effect are the same as when the causal
effect was zero. Notably, obesity paradox is happening only for
configurations such as α A = 3, αU = 3, βU = 3 (see the bottom

A strength of our study is that our findings are based
on mathematical results rather than simulations. However, we
restricted to binary variables. Further study is needed to extend
this: one context of interest within the obesity paradox is time
to event outcome (death), and continuous exposure (BMI).
We have given a simple exposition here, based on a minimal set of four variables. Two of these variables (U and A) were
assumed independent; however, dependence between these variables may affect the degree of the collider bias.16 There may be
multiple confounding variables; we have considered only one.
There may be latent subtypes of the mediating disease.20 Finally,
we have not considered the time-varying nature of obesity.
When examining the relationship between an exposure and
outcome in a subpopulation, the real interest is in whether this
relationship differs from the population as a whole, i.e., the relationship is moderated by the mediator. This can only be assessed
by modeling the whole population, with interaction terms

between exposure and moderator. However, statistical interaction
does not necessarily imply a true biological interaction.21
Our results show that the paradoxical observation of a
protective effect of obesity on mortality is unlikely to be fully
explained by collider stratification bias.
