Abstract
Previously, we reported the discovery of a genetically distinct hantavirus, designated Boginia
virus (BOGV), in the Eurasian water shrew (Neomys fodiens), as well as the detection of Seewis
virus (SWSV) in the Eurasian common shrew (Sorex araneus), in central Poland. In this expanded
study of 133 shrews and 69 moles captured during 2010–2013 in central and southeastern Poland,
we demonstrate the co-circulation of BOGV in the Eurasian water shrew and SWSV in the
Eurasian common shrew, Eurasian pygmy shrew (Sorex minutus) and Mediterranean water shrew
(Neomys anomalus). In addition, we found high prevalence of Nova virus (NVAV) infection in the
European mole (Talpa europaea), with evidence of NVAV RNA in heart, lung, liver, kidney,
spleen and intestine. The nucleotide and amino acid sequence variation of the L segment among
the SWSV strains was 0–18.8% and 0–5.4%, respectively. And for the 38 NVAV strains from
European moles captured in Huta Dłutowska, the L-segment genetic similarity ranged from 94.1–
100% at the nucleotide level and 96.3–100% at the amino acid level. Phylogenetic analyses
showed geographic-specific lineages of SWSV and NVAV in Poland, not unlike that of rodent-
borne hantaviruses, suggesting long-standing host-specific adaptation. The co-circulation and
distribution of BOGV, SWSV and NVAV in Poland parallels findings of multiple hantavirus
species coexisting in their respective rodent reservoir species elsewhere in Europe. Also, the
detection of SWSV in three syntopic shrew species resembles spill over events observed among
some rodent-borne hantaviruses.

1. Introduction
Hantaviruses (genus Hantavirus), the causative agents of hemorrhagic fever with renal
syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS), are unique among
the approximately 400-member Bunyaviridae family in that they have no known arthropod
hosts, and instead are harbored by small mammals. Initially, hantavirus reservoirs were
thought to be restricted to rodents (order Rodentia, family Muridae and Cricetidae), despite
the detection of hantavirus antigens in tissues of shrews and moles (order Eulipotyphla,
family Soricidae and Talpidae), such as the Eurasian common shrew (Sorex araneus),
Eurasian pygmy shrew (S. minutus), Eurasian water shrew (Neomys fodiens) and European
mole (Talpa europaea) in Russia and the former Yugoslavia more than two decades ago
(Gavrilovskaya et al., 1983; Gligic et al., 1992; Tkachenko et al., 1983). Also,
Thottapalayam virus (TPMV), originally an unclassified virus isolated from the Asian house
shrew (Suncus murinus) in India (Carey et al., 1971), was later shown to be a hantavirus
(Zeller et al., 1989) that occupied a separate evolutionary lineage from rodent-borne
hantaviruses (Chu et al., 1994; Song et al., 2007a; Xiao et al., 1994; Yadav et al., 2007).
Guided by these reports, and empowered by the generosity of museum curators and field
mammalogists who provided access to their archival tissue collections, an aggressive and
opportunistic search, employing reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR),
has resulted in the molecular identification of multiple genetically distinct hantaviruses
across space and time (Bennett et al., 2014; Yanagihara et al., 2014), including Seewis virus
(SWSV) and Nova virus (NVAV), in the Eurasian common shrew and European mole,
respectively (Kang et al., 2009b; Song et al., 2007b).
Subsequent studies have indicated that SWSV is widespread throughout Europe and Asia
across the vast distribution of its soricid reservoir, in Austria, Czech Republic, Finland,
Germany, Hungary, Russia, Slovakia and Slovenia (Kang et al., 2009a; Klempa et al., 2013;
Korva et al., 2013; Resman et al., 2013; Schlegel et al., 2012b). SWSV has also been
detected in the Siberian large-toothed shrew (S. daphaenodon) and tundra shrew (S.
tundrensis) in Russia (Yashina et al., 2010). And in a comprehensive phylogeographic study
of SWSV in Sorex species in Central Europe, SWSV exhibited distinct geographic-specific
clustering in Eurasian common shrews (Schlegel et al., 2012b). Moreover, a genetically
related but distinct hantavirus, named Asikkala virus (ASIV), has been found recently in the
Eurasian pygmy shrew (Radosa et al., 2013).
Previously, in an exploratory study of soricine shrews in central Poland, we reported the
discovery of a novel hantavirus, designated Boginia virus (BOGV), in the Eurasian water
shrew, as well as the detection of SWSV in the Eurasian common shrew (Gu et al., 2013).
The overlapping geographic ranges of these shrew species and the European mole prompted
the present expanded study on the genetic diversity of SWSV and NVAV in central and
southeastern Poland. Since NVAV had been detected in archival liver tissues of a single

European mole captured in Zala County, Hungary, in 1999 (Kang et al., 2009b), our
investigation also sought to ascertain the prevalence and tissue distribution of NVAV in the
European mole. Moreover, because SWSV exhibits host sharing among genetically related
soricine shrew species (Schlegel et al., 2012b; Yashina et al., 2010), a separate aim was to
determine the host restriction of NVAV in the European mole. Definitive data are presented
showing the high prevalence and widespread tissue distribution of NVAV in the European
mole. Moreover, SWSV, BOGV and/or NVAV were found to co-circulate in different
regions of central Poland, but no spill-over infection from shrews to moles, or vice versa,
was evident.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Trapping and specimen processing
Shrews were captured, using wooden live traps and pitfall traps, consisting of cones of
galvanized steel, measuring 40 cm high and 15 cm in diameter at the top, placed 5 m apart
and baited with raw bacon or beef. Moles were trapped using PVC pipes (25 cm long and 5
cm in diameter, equipped at both ends with flat aluminum latches). Trapping was conducted
during the month of September in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013, with each session covering
120 to 210 trap nights. Coordinates of each trap site are provided in Table 1. Although the
traps for shrews were checked very four hours and those for moles three times a day,
approximately 50% of shrews and 40% of moles were found dead. Live-caught shrews and
moles were euthanized by cervical dislocation, and stored at 4°C or −20°C for several hours
or days before harvesting of tissues. Lung, heart, liver, kidney, spleen and intestine tissues,
dissected using separate alcohol-cleaned instruments, were preserved in RNAlater® RNA
Stabilization Reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).
2.2. Ethics statement
All trapping and experimental procedures on shrews were approved by the ŁódŸ Ethical
Committee on Animal Testing (14/LB/511/2010 and 29/LB/548/2011) and the General
Directorate for Environmental Protection (DOP-OZGiZ.4200/N2732/10/JRO, DOP-OZGiZ.
6401.05.25.2011kp.3 and DOP-OZGiZ.6401.05.28.2011kp.1). The ŁódŸ Regional
Directorate for Environmental Protection approved protocols for moles (WPN-
I6631.2010.MS and WPN-L6400.59.2011.MS).
2.3. RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and RT-PCR amplification
Total RNA was extracted from 20–50 mg of tissue, using the PureLink Micro-to-Midi total
RNA purification kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). cDNA, synthesized using the SuperScript
III First-Strand Synthesis Systems (Invitrogen), were analyzed for hantavirus RNA by RT-
PCR, using oligonucleotide primers designed from highly conserved regions of hantavirus
genomes (Table 2) (Song et al., 2007b, 2007c, 2009; Kang et al., 2009a, 2009b; Gu et al.,
2013, 2014a, 2014b).
Nested or hemi-nested PCR was performed in 20-μL reaction mixtures, containing 250 μM
dNTP, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 1 U of Takara LA Taq polymerase (Takara, Shiga, Japan) and 0.25
μM of each primer (Table 2). Initial denaturation at 94°C for 2 min was followed by two

cycles each of denaturation at 94°C for 30 sec, two-degree step-down annealing from 46°C
to 38°C for 40 sec, and elongation at 72°C for 1 min, then 30 cycles of denaturation at 94°C
for 30 sec, annealing at 42°C for 40 sec, and elongation at 72°C for 1 min, in a GeneAmp
PCR 9700 thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, MA) (Arai et al., 2008b). PCR products
were separated, using MobiSpin S-400 spin columns (MoBiTec, Goettingen, Germany), and
amplicons were sequenced directly using an ABI Prism 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
2.4. Genetic and phylogenetic analyses
Sequences were aligned using Clustal W (Thompson et al., 1994). Unrooted phylogenetic
trees were generated by maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods, implemented in
PAUP* (Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony, 4.0b10) (Swofford, 2003), RAxML
Blackbox webserver (Stamatakis et al., 2008) and MrBayes 3.1 (Ronquist and Huelsenbeck,
2003), under the best-fit GTR+I+Γ model of evolution selected by hierarchical likelihood-
ratio test in MrModeltest v2.3 (Posada and Crandall, 1998) and jModelTest version 0.1
(Posada, 2008). Two replicate Bayesian Metropolis–Hastings Markov Chain Monte Carlo
runs, each comprising six chains of 10 million generations sampled every 100 generations
with a burn-in of 25,000 (25%), resulted in 150,000 trees overall. Each genomic segment (S
and L) was treated separately in phylogenetic analyses. The posterior node probabilities
were based on 2 million generations and estimated sample sizes over 100 (implemented in
MrBayes).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Co-circulation of genetically distinct hantaviruses
As determined by RT-PCR and verified by DNA sequencing, we previously demonstrated
BOGV in Eurasian water shrews and SWSV in Eurasian common shrews and in Eurasian
pygmy shrews from central Poland (Gu et al., 2013). In this expanded study of lung tissues
from 53 Eurasian common shrews, 52 Eurasian pygmy shrews, 12 Mediterranean water
shrews, 16 Eurasian water shrews and 69 European moles, we documented SWSV in six of
18 Eurasian common shrews in Chmiel, BOGV in four of 14 Eurasian water shrews from
Boginia, Kurowice and Huta Dłutowska, and the co-circulation of SWSV, BOGV and
NVAV and Huta Dłutowska (Table 1, Fig. 1).
SWSV has been detected in a small proportion of Eurasian pygmy shrews in Germany and
the Czech Republic (Schlegel et al., 2012b), as well as in Finland (Ling et al., 2014).
Similarly, in this study, SWSV RNA was found in tissues of two of 17 Eurasian pygmy
shrews from Kurowice, as well as in one of 12 Mediterranean water shrews from Chmiel
(Table 1, Fig. 1). Since there is only one other SWSV sequence from the Mediterranean
water shrew in Austria (GenBank EU418604), further research is necessary to determine if
this shrew species serves as a true reservoir host of SWSV. Whether the Mediterranean
water shrew also harbors a BOGV-like hantavirus, rather than only SWSV, is unclear.
Nevertheless, neither physical proximity with sharing of habitats nor genetic relatedness of
shrew host species allows prediction of the hantavirus species in a particular reservoir.

This study provides clear evidence of SWSV infection in the Eurasian common shrew in
central and southeastern Poland, as well as the co-existence of BOGV and NVAV in their
shrew and mole reservoir host species inhabiting the same ecological niche. Similar
observations have been reported for rodent-borne hantaviruses. That is, co-circulation of
hantaviruses is exemplified by bank voles (Myodes glareolus), yellow-necked field mice
(Apodemus flavicollis) and striped field mice (Apodemus agrarius), trapped in the
Transdanubian region of Hungary, harboring Puumala virus (PUUV), Dobrava virus
(DOBV) and Saaremaa virus, respectively (Plyusnina et al., 2009). Also, the simultaneous
occurrence of PUUV, DOBV and Tula virus (TULV) has been reported in Slovakia (Sibold
et al., 1999b), and two distinct hantaviruses associated with Apodemus mice have been
reported in Croatia (Plyusnina et al., 2011). Recently, hantavirus RNA was detected in My.
glareolus, Microtus agrestis and S. araneus, found dead in an area exposed to flooding in
eastern Poland (Wójcik-Fatla et al., 2013), and the first molecular evidence of PUUV has
now been reported from bank voles in Poland (Ali et al., 2014).
Extensive host sharing is evidenced by TULV infection in the common vole and field vole
in different regions of Germany (Schmidt-Chanasit et al., 2010), and TULV has also been
detected in the Eurasian water vole (Arvicola amphibius) (Schlegel et al., 2012a). Mention
has been made about the circulation of SWSV in several soricine shrew species in Siberia
(Yashina et al., 2010). Similarly, Jemez Springs virus appears to be harbored by the dusky
shrew (Arai et al., 2008) and other related Sorex species (such as S. palustris, S. trowbridgii
and S. vagrans) in North America (unpublished observations).
3.2. High prevalence of NVAV infection and virus distribution in tissues of European moles
In Huta Dłutowska, the overall prevalence of NVAV infection in European moles was
65.5% (38/58) during the four-year period, 2010–2013 (Table 1), resembling that reported
recently from two capture sites frequented by humans in France (Gu et al., 2014a). Such
high prevalences, exceeding 50%, are likely indicative of a long-standing reservoir host-
virus relationship and raise questions about factors that drive transmission. While it may be
assumed that NVAV is widespread throughout the geographic distribution of the European
mole, which extends from the United Kingdom across Scandinavia into European Russia,
longitudinal studies are warranted to ascertain temporal fluctuations of NVAV transmission
and the influence of insect and predator abundance (Gu et al., 2014a).
As determined by RT-PCR, NVAV RNA was detected in multiple tissues, besides lung, in a
high proportion of European moles (Table 2), suggesting widespread and persistent
infection. NVAV sequences within tissues of a single mole were identical, but varied by 0–
5.9% at the nucleotide level between moles. Although similarly extensive studies have not
been performed on other non-rodent species, hantavirus RNA has also been demonstrated in
multiple organs of the Ussuri white-toothed shrew (Crocidura lasiura) (Song et al., 2009)
and the Chinese mole shrew (Anourosorex squamipes) (Song et al., 2007c). Overall, the
tissue distribution was not unlike that found in rodents either naturally or experimentally
infected with Hantaan virus (HTNV) (Lee et al., 1978, 1981) or PUUV (Yanagihara et al.,
1985a, 1985b). Notably the presence of NVAV RNA in the kidney and intestine (Table 2)
would be consistent with viral shedding in urine and feces, which is believed to be important

in the transmission of rodent-borne hantaviruses to humans. Since European moles often
reside near human habitation, human exposure to their excretions is plausible. As such,
febrile illnesses or unusual clinical syndromes, occurring among individuals with known
exposure to moles, should be thoroughly investigated.
A weakness of the study was the unavailability of appropriately fixed tissues for
histopathological examination and immunocytochemical staining. As such, we were unable
to determine if endothelial cells and/or other specific cell types were infected with NVAV.
Also, logistical challenges of maintaining an adequate cold chain precluded the collection of
frozen tissues for assessment of virus infectivity in different tissues. Future studies are being
planned to address this shortcoming.
3.3. Genetic analysis
S-, M- and/or L-segment sequences of SWSV, BOGV and NVAV were analyzed. GenBank
accession numbers are provided for 60 L-, three M- and 42 S-segment sequences
(Supplementary Table 1). At the nucleotide level, the partial sequences of SWSV from
Poland showed considerable divergence from the SWSV prototype mp70 strain, differing by
15.0–17.3% and 14.8–22.0% in the S and L segment, respectively. However, nucleotide
sequence variation of SWSV strains within a specific geographic region was low, ranging
from 0–2.9% in Chmiel and 0% in Huta Dłutowska. Moreover, the encoded nucleocapsid
protein varied by ≤6.9% among SWSV strains from Poland and elsewhere in Europe.
BOGV, detected in four of 14 Eurasian water shrews captured in three separate villages in
central Poland (Boginia, Huta Dłutowska and Kurowice), was genetically distinct from
SWSV and other representative soricine shrew-borne hantaviruses, with M- and L-segment
sequence similarity of only 64.8–77.5% and 84.7–87.3% at the nucleotide and amino acid
levels, respectively (Gu et al., 2013).
The full-length 1,825-nucleotide S-genomic segment of NVAV strains 1135, 1136, 2095,
2097, 3328, 3329 and 3350 from Huta Dłutowska and strain 2086 from Bronisin contained a
single open reading frame, encoding a predicted N protein of 428 amino acids (nucleotide
positions 53 to 1336), and 52- and 486-nucleotide 5′- and 3′-noncoding regions (NCR),
respectively. The sequence variation in the coding region of the entire S-genomic segment
between the eight NVAV strains was 0.1–3.3% and 0–0.9% at the nucleotide and amino acid
levels, respectively. Comparison of the S segment to the prototype NVAV strain MSB95703
showed a nucleotide and amino acid sequence similarity of 85.8–86.1% and 96.0–96.5%. A
similar degree of nucleotide sequence divergence was found between the NVAV strains
from Poland and France, but there was high amino acid sequence similarity of >96%.
Using software available on the @NPS structure server (Combet et al., 2000), the predicted
secondary structure of the NVAV N protein was nearly identical to that reported earlier for
the prototype strain (Kang et al., 2009b). Similarly, alignment and comparison of a 788-
nucleotide (262-amino acid) region of the L-genomic segment of NVAV strains from
Poland showed approximately 15% difference at the nucleotide level but less than 2%
difference at the amino acid level from prototype NVAV MSB95703 from Hungary.

Moreover, SWSV strains from Poland varied from those from other geographic areas, but
there was high conservation at the amino acid level.
3.4. Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic analyses of the partial L-segment sequences of SWSV strains, generated using
maximum-likelihood and Bayesian methods, showed two distinct lineages with evidence of
geographic-specific clustering (Fig. 2). SWSV strains from Eurasian common shrews
captured in Chmiel (southeastern Poland) and in Boginia and Huta Dłutowska (central
Poland) were positioned on separate branches. High genetic diversity of SWSV was also
found in common shrews from Germany, the Czech Republic and Slovakia (Schlegel et al.,
2012b). Moreover, divergent lineages of the same hantavirus species within the same
geographic region have been reported for HTNV in the striped field mouse (Song et al.,
2000) and PUUV in the bank vole (Plyusnin et al., 1994; Razzauti et al., 2009, 2012).
Homologous recombination events have been suggested to account for the genetic variation
of TULV in Slovakia (Sibold et al., 1999a).
Phylogenetic analyses, using PAUP*, RAxML and MrBayes, based on the full-length S-
segment sequences of five NVAV strains from Poland showed a highly divergent clade,
comprising prototype NVAV from Hungary and newfound NVAV strains from France,
showing segregation according to geography (Fig. 2). Similarly, tree topologies, well
supported by bootstrap analysis (data not shown) and posterior node probabilities (Fig. 2),
were generated from maximum-likelihood and Bayesian analysis of the partial L-segment
sequences of NVAV strains from Poland, France and Hungary.
Recent discovery of genetically distinct hantaviruses in shrews and moles, and the detection
of a highly divergent lineage of hantaviruses in insectivorous bats from sub-Saharan Africa
(Gu et al., 2014b; Sumibcay et al., 2012; Weiss et al., 2012) and Asia (Arai et al., 2013; Gu
et al., 2014b; Guo et al., 2013), have forced a reframing of their evolutionary origins and
phylogeography. That these newfound hantaviruses are genetically more diverse than those
hosted by rodents suggests a complex evolutionary history. Moreover, ancestral
eulipotyphlans and chiropterans in Asia were the likely early mammalian hosts of primordial
hantaviruses, predating their appearance in rodents (Bennett et al., 2014). That is, in keeping
with other members of the Bunyaviridae family, which are transmitted by insects and
arthropods, the evolutionary origins of hantaviruses may have entailed insect-borne viruses,
which initially infected insectivorous ancestral hosts, with subsequent host switching and
species-specific adaptation in the distant and more recent past.
3.5. Conclusions
While outbreaks of HFRS have long been known to occur in central Europe (Klempa et al.,
2013), including Germany (Hofmann et al., 2008; Krüger et al., 2001), the Czech Republic
(Pejcoch et al., 2010) and Slovakia (Sibold et al., 1999b), reports of hantavirus infection and
disease in Poland have been conspicuously uncommon, despite the existence of the same
reservoir rodent species. Previously, TULV was isolated from the common vole in central
Poland (Song et al., 2004), and anti-hantavirus antibodies were reported among Polish
mammalogists (Sadkowska-Todys et al., 2007) and forestry workers (Grygorczuk et al.,
Gu et al. Page 7

2008). The first serologically confirmed case of HFRS, occurring in May 2005, was reported
in 2006 (Knap et al., 2006). Recently, an outbreak of hantavirus infection occurred between
August and December 2007 in the Carpathian mountains in southeastern Poland, in close
proximity to an HFRS focus in the Ruska Poruba region of neighboring Slovakia
(Nowakowska et al., 2009). Of the 13 serologically confirmed HFRS cases, 10 were caused
by DOBV and three by PUUV. Most patients had moderate to severe disease, and several
required hemodialysis (Nowakowska et al., 2009). Other suspected HFRS cases, albeit
unconfirmed by serological tests, have been described in southeastern Poland (Gut et al.,
2013).
HFRS cases are probably being misdiagnosed and under reported in Poland. Apart from
improving primary-care physician education and heightening their awareness about HFRS
throughout Poland, standardized serodiagnostic tests must be made more widely available in
clinical laboratories. Also, surveys of rodent and non-rodent reservoir host populations and
virus isolation attempts are urgently needed to gain more in-depth knowledge about the
distribution and pathogenic potential of hantaviruses, particularly in southeastern Poland.

Phylogenetic trees generated by the maximum-likelihood and Bayesian methods, using the
GTR+I+Γ model of evolution as estimated from the data, based on the alignment of the
coding regions of the (S) partial and full length S segment and (L) partial L segment of
soricid- and talpid-borne hantaviruses in Poland. Because the unrooted phylogenetic trees
using both methods were very similar, the trees generated by MrBayes were displayed. The
phylogenetic positions of SWSV (blue) and BOGV (green) from Poland are shown in
relationship to the prototype SWSV strain from Switzerland (SWSV mp70, S: EF636024; L:
EF636026). NVAV (red) strains from Poland are shown in relationship to the prototype
NVAV strain from Hungary (MSB95703, S: FJ539168; L: FJ593498) and to representative
NVAV strains from France (YA0067, S: KF010576; L: KF010544; and YA0069, S:
KF010575; L: KF010542). Other hantaviruses harbored by shrews and moles include
Thottapalayam virus (TPMV VRC66412, S: AY526097; L: EU001330), Imjin virus (MJNV
