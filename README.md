# SemEval 2019 Task-12 Toponym Resolution in Scientific Papers
Toponym resolution, also known as geoparsing, geo-grounding or place name resolution, aims to assign geographic coordinates to all location names mentioned in documents. Toponym resolution is usually performed in two independent steps. First, toponym detection or geotagging, where the span of place names mentioned in a document is noted. Second, toponym disambiguation or geocoding, where each name found is mapped to latitude and longitude coordinates corresponding to the centroid of its physical location. This project concentrates on Toponym detection. Project contains of three main modules.
